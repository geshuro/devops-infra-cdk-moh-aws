random-journal.pdf,"A randomized, double-blind study comparing the efficacy and safety of trazodone once-a-day and venlafaxine extended-release for the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder","This double-blind, randomized study evaluated the efficacy and safety of trazodone OAD (once-a-day) in comparison with venlafaxine XR (extended-release) in 324 patients (166 trazodone and 158 venlafaxine) with major depressive disorder (MDD). The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) at week 8. Both treatments were effective in reducing the HAM-D-17 total score at week 8 vs. baseline (intent-to-treat: trazodone -12.9, venlafaxine -14.7; per protocol: trazodone -15.4, venlafaxine -16.4). Patients in the venlafaxine group achieved better results after 8 weeks, whereas the trazodone group achieved a statistically significant reduction in HAM-D-17 following only 7 days of treatment. The most frequent adverse events (AEs) were dizziness and somnolence in the trazodone group, and nausea and headache in the venlafaxine group. Most AEs were mild-to-moderate in severity. This study confirmed that both venlafaxine XR and trazodone OAD may represent a valid treatment option for patients with MDD.",31972628Dose-response relationship with venlafaxine,"Considerations when selecting a first-line antidepressant agent include the potential for achieving greater response with increasing dosages, thereby allowing greater flexibility in dosing. The efficacy and dose-response of venlafaxine, a novel serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, was evaluated in two placebo-controlled studies. Both studies demonstrated that venlafaxine was efficacious (as determined by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Clinical Global Impressions scale scores), as well as safe and tolerable when administered either twice or three times daily in the treatment of outpatients who had major depression. In addition, evidence of a dose-response relationship was shown in both studies.",8784645"Concerns With Entertainment-Education: Zombie Pandemic Preparedness and the Unanticipated Promotion of a Weapons Culture","Entertainment-education has proved to be an engaging medium through which to explore health and social issues in populations. Given the popularity of the zombie theme in popular culture it is no surprise therefore that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adopted this theme in an effort to engage youth and young adults in emergency preparedness. However, an earlier observational study involving elementary school children based on this premise raised concerns that it may have unexpectedly promoted a focus on firearms. A randomized control study involving 89 children (average age 10.4 years) was therefore conducted to explore this possibility in more depth. One group was exposed to a natural disaster scenario, while the other group was exposed to the zombie pandemic theme. When subsequently asked to prepare emergency kit lists, participants in the zombie themed scenario were 15.84 times as likely to include firearms in their lists compared with participants who were exposed to the natural disaster scenario. Although the sample size in this study was small, it is suggested that future interventions using entertainment-education need to explore all aspects of the messages implicit in their chosen medium, rather than just focusing on one element.",27837014

This technique is being developed for the treatment of liver tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, or liver metastases. It represents a real alternative to surgical resection or liver transplantation when patients are inoperable or when tumours are unresectable. It is mandatory to standardize and simplify the current methods of evaluation and monitoring in order to benefit from a better understanding of the effectiveness and of the tolerance of this new treatment modality. Several scientific societies have recently proposed recommendations for the implementation of stereotactic radiotherapy for liver tumors. We conducted a literature review to provide recommendations for follow-up after completion of a stereotactic body radiation therapy for liver tumours.",exclusion,Written in French,,10.1016/j.canrad.2015.05.020

Treatment of HCC requires interdisciplinary discussion and multimodal therapy approaches. Beside established loco-regional and systemic therapies, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) gained increasing importance over recent years. First results of early clinical studies indicate high rates of local control with a good safety profile. In the present work, we evaluated our single center experiences with SBRT in patients with advanced HCCs.Ten patients with 16 SBRTs were included and retrospectively analyzed in this case collection. All patients presented in advanced tumor stages with vascular invasion and/or metastases, but preserved liver function. Two patients were treated only with SBRT, two after TACE and six patients received SBRT in addition to systemic therapy. In most of the cases SBRT were applied to intrahepatic lesions. Large tumor thromboses, lymph nodes as well as bone metastases were irradiated in one, three and five fractions with a median overall dose of 38 Gy. We observed a good local tumor control with a good safety profile in all cases. No severe complications occurred in combination to sequential as well as additive approach to loco-regional or systemic treatments.In conclusion, our experiences confirm results of early clinical studies indicating safe use and good local control rates also in advanced stages of HCC with preserved liver function.",exclusion,Written in german,,10.1055/a-1072-6683

A Phase I study in relapsed Ewing's sarcoma. (N = 16) had one 9 month partial response and a two-year survival rate of 44% [1]. Rapid, durable systemic immune activation was seen in the majority of patients using an IFNgamma ELISPOT assay [2]. We seek to extend these early findings in a randomized Phase 2 study (NCT02511132). Method(s): Following surgery (for Vigil manufacture), patients are randomized 1:1 to Vigil (1 x 10 cells/ml by monthly intradermal injection), or to chemotherapy with gemcitabine 675mg/m2 IV D1 and D8 and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV D8 every 21 days. Key eligibility criteria include: Age > 2, histologically documented metastatic Ewing's, refractory or intolerant to >=2 prior lines of chemotherapy, and availability of at least 4 doses of manufactured Vigil. Patients with bone only disease are ineligible. The primary objective is to compare the overall survival of patients treated with Vigil vs. chemotherapy. The sample size of 62 patients assumes a one-year survival rate of 25% in the chemotherapy group vs. 60% in the Vigil group, corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.383 favoring Vigil. Result(s): As of January 2017, thirteen patients have been randomized at 10 centers in the U.S. The design allows for reduction in disease burden prior to surgery using modalities like SBRT and interventional radiology. Toxicity of Vigil has been low compared to chemotherapy. Time to disease progression is being assessed in patients who crossover to Vigil after progressing on chemotherapy. Systemic control of metastatic lesions using cryoablation is also being assessed in other patients (e.g. DSRCT liver metastases) using a separate IND. Conclusion(s): Although associated with systemic immune activation, additional means to reduce disease burden such as SBRT and cryoablation can possibly improve patient health and augment Vigil efficacy.",exclusion,Wrong intervention,,

A variety of SABR fractionation schemes are in clinical use. We conducted a phase I dose-escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of single-fraction liver SABR. Method(s): Patients with liver metastases from solid tumors, for whom a critical volume dose constraint could be met, were treated with single-fraction SABR. Seven patients were enrolled to the first group, with a prescription dose of 35 Gy. Dose was then escalated to 40 Gy in a single fraction, and seven more patients were treated at this dose level. Patients were followed for toxicity and underwent serial imaging to assess lesion response and local control. Result(s): Fourteen patients with 17 liver metastases were treated. There were no dose-limiting toxicities observed at either dose level. Nine of the 13 lesions assessable for treatment response showed a complete radiographic response to treatment; the remainder showed partial response. Local control of irradiated lesions was 100 % at a median imaging follow-up of 2.5 years. Two-year overall survival for all patients was 78 %.

METHODS: An institutional IRB approved phase I clinical trial was conducted. Eligible patients had 1-3 liver metastases measuring less than 5 cm, and no metastases location within 2 cm of the GI tract. Dose escalation was conducted with three dose cohorts. The low, intermediate, and high dose cohorts were planned to receive 36, 48, and 60 respectively to the internal target volume (ITV) in 3 fractions. At least 700 mL of normal liver had to receive <15. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) included acute grade 3 liver, intestinal or spinal cord toxicity or any grade 4 toxicity. The MTD is defined as the dose level below that which results in DLT in 2 or more of the 6 patients in the highest dose level cohort. RESULTS: Nine patients were enrolled (6 male, 3 female): median age 64 years (range, 33-77 years); median gross tumor volume (GTV) 11.1 mL (range, 2.14-89.3 mL); most common primary site, colorectal (5 patients). Four patients had multiple tumors. No patient experienced a DLT and dose was escalated to 60 in 3 fractions without reaching MTD. The only toxicity within 90 days of completion of treatment was one patient with a grade 1 skin hyperpigmentation without tenderness or desquamation. Two patients in the low dose cohort had local recurrence and repeat SBRT was done to previously treated lesions without any toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: Biologically ablative Proton SBRT doses are well tolerated in patients with limited liver metastases with no patients experiencing any grade 2+ acute toxicity. Results from this trial provide the grounds for an ongoing phase II Proton SBRT study of 60 over 3 fractions for liver metastases.",exclusion,Other study design and wrong comparator,,http://dx.doi.org/10.21037/jgo.2018.08.17

A phase I trial of nivolumab and ipilimumab in advanced NSCLC demonstrated encouraging activity and manageable toxicity. Irradiation provides palliative and local responses in NSCLC. Increasing evidence suggests that apart from its direct effects, radiotherapy and particularly ablative hypofractionated radiotherapy can act as a trigger for the innate and adaptive immune system termed the abscopal effect. The balance of signals (pro-immunogenic and immunosuppressive) may determine the effectiveness of both systemic antitumor immune responses and local tumor cell killing. Direct tumor debulking by radiation may also be particularly well suited as an adjunct to immunotherapy. In addition, immunotherapy after RT has demonstrated survival benefit. Method(s): This is a phase I study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combination nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks), ipilimumab (1 mg/kg every 6 weeks), and sequential or concurrent SBRT in patients with stage IV NSCLC. Patients will be simultaneously accrued to sequential versus concurrent arms in a randomized 1:1 fashion as first-line therapy. Eligibility criteria include EGFR/ALK negative stage IV disease with PS 0-1. The primary outcome is the safest SBRT dose to various metastatic locations delivered prior to or concurrently with nivolumab and ipilimumab. Metastatic locations include 1)peripheral lung, 2)central lung or mediastinal lymph node, 3)liver, 4)osseous, and 5)abdominal/pelvic with doses ranging 30-50 Gy in 3-5 fractions. Secondary outcomes include toxicity, response rate, progression free survival, tumor microenvironment changes, and immunogenicity of combination therapy. Patients will undergo biopsies pre- and post-SBRT to provide insight into the mechanism of the radiation-induced pro-inflammatory microenvironment. The total sample size will include 40-80 patients depending on the number who contribute to multiple metastatic sites. Twenty patients per randomized arm will be needed to assess the initial starting dose. Result(s): Trial in progress.",exclusion,Other study design,,
random-journal.pdf,LivM8,"E., Chajon",2018,English,LIV.M:#2,A phase I/II trial of hafnium oxide nanoparticles activated by radiotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastasis,"Introduction: Management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver metastasis (mets) requires complementary expertise of multiple specialties. Treatment decisions are increasingly complex and physicians must face a wide range of underlying liver dysfunctions and concomitant malignancies. Among available treatments, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is well-tolerated. Yet, like with all radiation therapy (RT) techniques, the energy dose deposit needs to be maximized in tumor cells without affecting the surrounding healthy tissues. For such purpose, nanoparticles of hafnium oxide, NBTXR3, were designed to effectively absorb ionizing radiation and augment the dose deposited within the tumor cells only when activated by RT. NBTXR3 is characterized by one single administration before the first RT session and it fits into existing standard of care with no change in patient treatment schedule protocol or equipment occupancy. It is currently evaluated in a phase I/II clinical trial bringing together multiple medical fields to introduce the use of NBTXR3 with SBRT in patients with HCC or liver mets [NCT02721056]. Method(s): The trial follows a 3+3 dose escalation design at dose levels of NBTXR3 corresponding to 10%, 15%, 22%, 33% and 45% of the baseline tumor volume. Treatment is performed as a single intralesional or intraarterial injection followed by SBRT (45Gy / 3 fractions / 5 to 7 days) on patients with HCC with/without Portal Vein Tumor Thrombosis or liver mets. As SBRT is not supported by all French hospitals, the coordination of two institutions was needed in managing the patients course. This study aims primarily at identifying the Recommended Dose and of early Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs). Secondary endpoints include target lesions investigator assessment by mRECIST via MRI. Result(s): The first two dose levels at 10% and 15% are completed with 6 and 4 patients respectively. Two patients are currently included at the third dose level at 22%. All currently recruited patients were treated by intralesional injection. No early DLTs nor adverse events (AE) related to NBTXR3 were observed. One grade 2 malaise and two grade 3 abdominal pain AEs were reported to be related to the injection procedure. No serious adverse events related to NBTXR3 nor to the injection procedure were observed. Dispersion and permanence assessments by CT scan confirmed NBTXR3 to stay within the tumor without negatively impacting liver functions nor the reliability of the image-guided radiation therapy. Investigator assessment on target lesions by mRECIST via MRI resulted with the following best observed responses of target lesions to date in 7 evaluable patients: 3 complete responses, 3 partial responses and 1 stable disease. Conclusion(s): Overall, NBTXR3 is well tolerated with a positive safety profile. Indeed, NBTXR3 could constitute an encouraging perspective for patients vulnerable to liver complications. The success of the cooperation between different medical disciplines and several sites paves the way to an innovative mean of managing multidisciplinary affections. In parallel, NBTXR3 is also evaluated in 5 other clinical trials, including a phase II/III in soft tissue sarcoma [NCT02379845] and phases I/II for head and neck [NCT01946867; NCT02901483], prostate [NCT02805894] and rectum cancers [NCT02465593].",exclusion,"Other study, no comparator",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdy150 
random-journal.pdf,LivM9,"E., Chajon",2018,English,LIV.M:#2;LIV.P:#2,A phase I/II trial of NBTXR3 nanoparticles activated by SBRT in the treatment of liver cancers,"Background: A new class of material with high electron density, hafnium oxide, was designed at the nanoscale (NBTXR3) to efficiently enhance the energy dose deposit from within the tumor cells and increase lethality of tumors, when exposed to radiotherapy (RT). The physical mode of action of NBTXR3 may represent a breakthrough approach for the local treatment of liver cancers, as it does not engage liver and renal functions, i.e. nanoparticles are not metabolized and not excreted by kidney. A phase I/II trial has been implemented for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastasis [NCT02721056]. The study is currently recruiting patients. Method(s): Patients (pts) receive a single intralesional (IL) injection of NBTXR3 (53.3g/L) at Volume levels equivalent to 10%, 15%, 22% and 33% of the baseline tumor volume, followed by RT (SBRT, 45Gy / 3 fractions / 5 to 7 days). For the Phase I part, primary endpoints include determination of the Recommended Dose and Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT). The Phase II part will test three different groups of patients, HCC with portal vein thrombus, HCC without portal vein thrombus and a third cohort with liver metastases. Primary endpoints are complete response rate and safety. Result(s): Enrollment was completed for Volume levels 10% (6 pts) and 15% (4 pts) and is currently recruiting patients at 22% level. The NBTXR3 injections were successful in all cases. Radiotherapy has been delivered as planned without any DLT occurrence. No serious adverse event (SAE) related to NBTXR3 or the treatment procedure occurred. Three adverse events related to the injection were reported and no adverse event related to NBTXR3. Importantly, NBTXR3 nanoparticles did not have any impact on the reliability of image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT). Conclusion(s): The injection of NBTXR3 was safe and well tolerated at these levels. Patients received the planned RT. No DLT occurred. Enrollment is now opened at the 22% level. NBTXR3 shows promising results in terms of safety and antitumor activity and is also currently evaluated in other six clinical studies.",exclusion,"Other study, wrong intervention, no comparator",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2018.36.4-suppl.TPS551 
random-journal.pdf,LivM10,"Bi, Nan",2019,eng,LIV.M:#1;LIV.P:#1,A Phase II Trial of Concurrent Temozolomide and Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Complex Brain Metastases.,"PURPOSE: Complex brain metastases (BMs), such as large lesions, lesions within or close to eloquent locations, or multiple recurrent/progressive BMs, remain the most challenging forms of brain cancer because of decreased intracranial control rates and poor survival. In the present study, we report the results from a single institutional phase II trial of concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) with hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HFSRT) in patients with complex brain metastases, including assessment of its feasibility and toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-four patients with histologically proven primary cancer and complex BMs were enrolled between 2010 and 2015. All the patients were treated with concurrent HFSRT and TMZ (administrated orally at a dosage of 75 mg/m(2) per day for at least 20 days). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 30.6 months. The local control rates at 1 and 2 years were 96% and 82%, respectively. The median OS was 17.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.6-22.2), and the OS rates at 1 and 2 years were 65% (95% CI, 52%-78%) and 33% (19%-47%). Only six patients (15.8%) died of intracranial disease. The median brain metastasis-specific survival was 46.9 months (95% CI, 35.5-58.4). Treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events were rare and included one grade 3 hematological toxicity and two grade 3 liver dysfunctions. CONCLUSION: Treatment using HFSRT concurrent with TMZ was well tolerated and could significantly extend OS compared with historical controls in complex BMs. Large randomized clinical trials are warranted. Trial registration ID: NCT02654106. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The treatment using hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy concurrent with temozolomide appeared to be safe and could significantly extend overall survival compared with historical control in complex brain metastases. Large randomized clinical trials are warranted to verify our results.",exclusion,Wrong patients,,10.1634/theoncologist.2018-0702

The present randomized phase II study aimed to compare 2 SSRS schedules to determine which results the lowest rate of grade 3 or higher protocol-specified adverse events at 4 months. Materials/Methods: Patients with biopsy-proven non-hematogenous malignancy and limited un-irradiated spine metastases not requiring upfront spine surgery were eligible. Patients were randomized to receive either 16 Gy in 1 fraction or 24 Gy in 3 fractions on every other day. This study was designed to detect a protocol-specified adverse event rate > 20% at a 10% significance level (1-sided) and 90% power. Secondary analysis included time to treatment failure, which was defined as presence of grade 3 or higher adverse events or unequivocal local progression of treated spine(s) indicative of re-irradiation or surgical intervention. Designating the preferable of the 2 schedules was based on rules of protocol-specified adverse events and treatment failure rate for each arm. Result(s): Between November 2015 and October 2018, 50 patients (pts) were enrolled for SSRS to 75 metastatic spinal lesions, including 41 lung cancer, 2 breast cancer, 2 head and neck cancer, 2 liver cancer, 2 prostate cancer, and 1 colon cancer. The median age was 62 years old (range 36-79). There were 1 cervical, 41 thoracic, 31 lumbar, and 2 sacral sites for SSRS. Twenty-six patients were randomized to the single-fraction (SF) arm, and 24 patients were randomized to the multi-fraction (MF) arm. The median follow-up time was 11.73 months (range 0.67-39 months). At 4 months, none of the 25 evaluable patients in the SF arm experienced any protocol-specified grade 3 or higher toxicity, but 1 out of the 21 evaluable patients in the MF arm underwent surgical intervention due to progressive compression fracture. During longer follow-up, 2 patients in the SF arm and five additional patients in the MF arm developed treatment failure. The median time to treatment failure was 13.5 months for SF arm, and 8 months for MF arm. The one-year treatment failure rate was significantly worse in the MF arm (SF 5.6% versus MF 14.3%, p=0.04). Conclusion(s): Both SF and MF SSRS seem safe and the SF arm has met its primary endpoint. The interim analysis suggests 16 Gy in single fraction might be the preferable SSRS schedule and warrants longer follow-up as well as further investigation.Copyright © 2019",exclusion,Wrong intervention,,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.06.477

Most data to support locally-directed treatment, such as stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), for oligometastases are from retrospective institutional reports. Following the success of a recently completed and reported phase II trial demonstrating important clinical outcomes, herein we review the current landscape of ongoing clinical trials in this context. Materials and methods: A review of currently activated and registered clinical trials was performed using the clinicaltrials.gov database from inception to February 2019. A search of actively recruiting trials, using the key words oligometastases, SABR, and various related terms was performed. Search results were independently reviewed by two investigators, with discrepancies settled by a third. Data abstracted from identified studies included study type, primary disease site, oncologic endpoints, and inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results: Of the initial 216 entries identified, 64 met our review eligibility criteria after full-text review. The most common study type was a phase II clinical trial (n = 35, 55%) with other study designs ranging from observational registry trials to phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A minority of trials were randomized in design (n = 17, 27%). While most studies allowed for metastases from multiple primary disease sites (n = 22, 34%), the most common was prostate (n = 13, 15%), followed by breast, gastrointestinal, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and renal (n = 6, 9% each). In studies with a solitary target site, the most common was liver (n = 6, 9%) followed by lung (n = 3, 5%). The most common primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) (n = 20, 31%) and toxicity (n = 10, 16%). A combined strategy of systemic therapy and SABR was an emerging theme (n = 23, 36%), with more recent studies specifically evaluating SABR and immunotherapy (n = 9, 14%). Conclusion: The safety and efficacy of SABR as oligometastasis-directed treatment is increasingly being evaluated within prospective clinical trials. These data are awaited to compliment the abundance of existing observational studies and to guide clinical decision-making.",exclusion,Review,"Important, read for more information",10.3389/fonc.2019.00543

Prior reports of V-effective (Veff), individualized SBRT in liver metastases demonstrate 1- year local control (LC-1) rates exceeding 70%. Protons can potentially allow for higher dose delivery when using an individualized, Veff-based strategy due to lack of exit dose, and thereby, allow for improved local control. In this study we evaluate the efficacy of Veff, individualized proton (P-) SBRT in patients with liver metastases from solid tumors. Materials/Methods: Patients enrolled in an NCI sponsored, single arm, phase 2 study (NCT 01239381). Key eligibility included liver metastases from a solid tumor, absent or limited extrahepatic disease (stable for >3 mo), Child's A or no cirrhosis, ECOG PS 0-2, no prior liver-directed RT and expected survival >3 months. No upper size limit was required, but pts were required to have least 800 mL of uninvolved liver. Patients were treated with 5 P-SBRT treatments. Radiation dose was based on Veff of liver-GTV. Patients with Veff <0.22 received 50 Gy, Veff 0.22-0.50 received 40 Gy, and Veff >0.51 received 30 Gy. Treatments were administered as one daily fraction, 2-3 days per week, over 2 weeks. The trial was designed to demonstrate >70% local control at 1 year with P-SBRT. Result(s): From 2009-2014, 91 pts were enrolled, of whom 90 were analyzed (1 withdrew prior to treatment). Median age was 68 (range, 34-89), 57 (63%) were male; 35 (39%) had colorectal primary, 16 (18%) had pancreatic, 12 (13%) had esophagogastric, 8 (9%) had HCC, 5 (6%) had lung, 3 (3%) had gallbladder, 3 (3%) had breast, 3 (3%) had small bowel or duodenal, 2 (2%) had anal, 2 (2%) had H&N, and 1 (1%) had prostate. Fifty-four pts (60%) had 1 tumor, 21 pts (23%) had 2, 10 pts (11%) had 3, 5 pts (6%) had 4. Median tumor size among 142 of the 146 tumors was 2.55 cm (range, 0.48-11.9).

Material(s) and Method(s): This single-arm, two center phase 2 clinical trial included 50 patients with 18F-FDG PET-avid CRLM <= 3.5 cm considered unsuitable for surgery and thermal ablation according to a multidisciplinary expert panel. The primary endpoint was technique efficacy. Secondary aims were safety, technical success, local control following repeat procedures, disease-free and overall survival. Result(s): Between April 2014 and September 2018, 50 patients with 61 CRLM were treated with IRE. Technical success was 98%; in 1 patient treatment was stopped prematurely due to a serious cardiac arrhythmia triggered by the electrical pulses. After treatment, 69% of the lesions were completely eradicated. Following repeat procedures, local control was reached in 85% of patients. Ten minor complications and 16 major complications (14 grade III, 2 grade IV) occurred in 20 patients. One patient died within 90 days after IRE. Conclusion(s): IRE represents a relatively safe and effective ablation method to eradicate CRLM <= 3.5 cm considered unsuitable for surgery and thermal ablation. Given the local control, IRE should currently not be considered for resectable or thermally ablatable CRLM. The local control rate, the low toxicity and the parenchyma sparing character of IRE justifies a future study comparing IRE to stereotactic body radiotherapy (COLDFIRE-3).",exclusion,Wrong intervention,,

As the prognosis of patients with locally advanced PHC or lymph node metastases in the palliative setting is significantly better compared with patients with organ metastases, ablative therapies may be beneficial. Unfortunately, current ablative options are limited. Photodynamic therapy causes skin phototoxicity and thermal ablative methods, such as stereotactic body radiation therapy and radiofrequency ablation, which are affected by a heat/cold-sink effect when tumours are located close to vascular structures, such as the liver hilum. These limitations may be overcome by irreversible electroporation (IRE), a relatively new ablative method that is currently being studied in several other soft tissue tumours, such as hepatic and pancreatic tumours. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this multicentre phase I/II safety and feasibility study, 20 patients with unresectable PHC due to vascular or distant lymph node involvement will undergo IRE. Ten patients who present with unresectable PHC will undergo CT-guided percutaneous IRE, whereas ultrasound-guided IRE will be performed in 10 patients with unresectable tumours detected at exploratory laparotomy. The primary outcome is the total number of clinically relevant complications (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, score of≥3) within 90 days. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, tumour response, metal stent patency and survival. Follow-up will be 2 years. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol has been approved by the local ethics committees. Data and results will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSION: The Ablation with irreversible eLectroportation in Patients with Advanced perihilar CholangiocarcinomA (ALPACA) study is designed to assess the feasibility of IRE for advanced PHC. The main purpose is to inform whether a follow-up trial to evaluate safety and effectiveness in a larger cohort would be feasible.",exclusion,Wrong intervention,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-015810

Further reports of outcomes are required to strengthen the level of evidence in the absence of comparative trials evaluating different practical procedures. The aim of this prospective single institutional study is to analyse, in unselected cohort of patients from real-world clinical practice, the long-term survival, tumor control outcomes and safety of SBRT in OD (radical ablative radiotherapy with biological equivalent dose BED10>100 Gy). In addition to standard toxicity and survival parameters, we report unique outcomes as FFWD - Freedom from widespread dissemination, FFNT - Freedom from the need of subsequent treatment and functional survival with Karnofsky performance status higher than 70%. A total of 110 patients were prospectively evaluated, 60% and 40% were treated for lung and liver oligometastatic disease, respectively. No grade 3 or 4 acute toxicities (CTCAE) were reported. With median follow up of 22.2 months and 2-year overall survival of 88.3%, four patients (6.1%) experienced local progression in the lung SBRT cohort. In the liver SBRT cohort, median follow up was 33 months, 2-year overall survival was 68.5% and 11 patients (25%) experienced local and 36 (81.8%) distal progression. Higher BED10 of 150-170 Gy compared to 100-150 Gy was an independent positive prognostic factor for local progression-free survival for all patients with hazard ratio 0.25. This confirms SBRT ablative radiobiology effects to be independent of OD primary histology and location. The best outcomes in terms of FFNT were observed in the multivariable analysis of patients with 1-2 lung OD compared to both the liver OD cohort and patients with more than 2 lung metastases. Better FFNT in the liver SBRT cohort was observed in patients with 1-2 liver metastases and in patients whose liver OD was irradiated by higher BED10. In conclusion, SBRT is a suitable option for patients who are not surgical candidates; with approximately 30% of patients not requiring subsequent treatment 2 years after SBRT. We believe that this treatment represents a safe and effective option for oligometastatic involvement in patients with various primary tumors.",exclusion,Other study design and no comparator,,10.4149/neo_2018_180731N558

Materials: The most recent version of the National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried for adult patients diagnosed with AJCC stage 1-3 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) between 2004-2016. Patients receiving surgical resection of metastatic sites were excluded. HCC treatment was stratified as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT; defined as beam-based radiotherapy). Kaplan-Meier plots, log rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate overall survival. Propensity score matching was utilized to account for potential confounders, separately for stage 1 and stage 2/3 disease. Result(s): A total of 13,030 patients met inclusion criteria, of whom n = 10,517 (80.6%) received RFA and n = 2531 (19.4%) SRT. Median SRT radiation dose was 44 Gy (IQR: 30-50 Gy) over a median of 5 fractions (IQR: 3-11 fractions). Patients treated with SRT were more commonly older whites with Medicare insurance and low comorbidities compared to RFA. SRT was less common for stage 1 HCC compared to RFA (48.3% vs. 67.7%, P <0.001) and for larger HCC (median size, 40 vs. 26 mm, P <0.001). HCC treatment via SRT was more common in East North Central and Middle Atlantic States. Annual case numbers for both treatment modalities increased from 2004-2016. After propensity score matching RFA to SRT for stage 1 HCC, a matched cohort with n = 1,868 patients was obtained with balanced confounders between both treatment modalities. Overall survival was evident for RFA vs. SRT in the matched cohort (HR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.59-0.75, P <0.001). Comparable results were obtained for stage 2/3 HCC after propensity score matching (n = 1,694 patients, RFA vs. SRT HR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.55-0.69, P <0.001). Conclusion(s): A majority of patients with non-surgically treated HCC receive RFA that shows superior overall survival versus stereotactic radiotherapy.Copyright © 2020",exclusion,Wrong comparator,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2019.12.558

Methods and Materials From 2003 to 2009, 81 patients with 142 metastases were treated in institutional review board-approved SBRT studies (5-10 fractions). Patients were treated during free breathing (with or without abdominal compression) or with controlled exhale breath-holding. SBRT was planned on a static exhale computed tomography (CT) scan, and the minimum planning target volume dose to 0.5 cm3 (minPTV) was recorded. The accumulated minimum dose to the 0.5 cm3 gross tumor volume (accGTV) was calculated after performing dose accumulation from exported image guided radiation therapy data sets registered to the planning CT using rigid (2-dimensional MV/kV orthogonal) or deformable (3-dimensional/4-dimensional cone beam CT) image registration. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models assessed the factors influencing the time to local progression (TTLP). Hazard ratios for accGTV and minPTV were compared using model goodness-of-fit and bootstrapping. Results Overall, the accGTV dose exceeded the minPTV dose in 98% of the lesions. For 5 to 6 fractions, accGTV doses of >45 Gy were associated with 1-year local control of 86%. On univariate analysis, the cancer subtype (breast), smaller tumor volume, and increased dose were significant predictors for improved TTLP. The dose and volume were uncorrelated; the accGTV dose and minPTV dose were correlated and were tested separately on multivariate models. Breast cancer subtype, accGTV dose (P<.001), and minPTV dose (P=.02) retained significance in the multivariate models. The univariate hazard ratio for TTLP for 5-Gy increases in accGTV versus minPTV was 0.67 versus 0.74 (all patients; 95% confidence interval of difference 0.03-0.14). Goodness-of-fit testing confirmed the accGTV dose as a stronger dose-response predictor than the minPTV dose. Conclusions The accGTV dose is a better predictor of TTLP than the minPTV dose for liver metastasis SBRT. The use of modern image guided radiation therapy in future analyses of dose-response outcomes should increase the concordance between the planned and delivered doses.Copyright © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.",exclusion,No comparator,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2015.07.2273

There is a paucity of prospective quality of life (QOL) data published for liver SABR. Moreover reported series often include hepatocellular-carcinoma. Herein we report QOL after SABR in patients with liver metastases (LM) Materials/Methods: A single-institution prospective cohort study was undertaken to measure the acute changes in QOL after SABR. Patients with Child-Pugh A liver function, any solid primary tumor with 1-3 LM treated with SABR were eligible. Doses of 30-60 Gy in 3-5 fractions were delivered. Indications of SABR included oligometastases and oligoprogression. Prospective QOL was measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life QuestionnaireeCore 15 Palliative (QLQ-C15) and the EORTC QLQeliver metastases (QLQ-LM21) validated questionnaires at baseline, first week of treatment, last day of treatment, then 1, 6 and 12 weeks after treatment completion. In addition the functional living index-emesis (FLIE) was collected at baseline, first week of treatment, last day, and 1 week after completion. Univariable linear mixed modelling was performed to assess changes of QOL over time. Multivariable linear mixed modelling was performed to determine predictors of QOL changes after adjusting for time. A minimally important difference (MID) in QOL was defined as a change of 10 points compared to baseline for each follow-up visit with 10-point decrease representing worse QOL. A 2-tailed p-value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): Sixty patients (32 males) were included. Mean age at time of treatment was 67+/-13 years. Median BED10 was 100 Gy (58-180). The most common primary cancer was colorectal in 42% of the patients followed by other gastro-intestinal malignancies in 17% and breast in 15%. Oligometastasis was the treatment indication in 55% of patients. Actuarial overall survival at 1 year was 79%. The global health score measured by QLQ-C15 was significantly worse at treatment completion (pZ0.001), 1w (pZ0.003) and 6w (pZ0.002) after SABR but recovered by 3 months (pZ0.124). Nausea, constipation and fatigue were also worse at treatment completion (p<0.05) but recovered 1 and 6 weeks after treatment. The FLIE questionnaire showed consistent findings for nausea with significant deterioration at the end of treatment (p<0.001). The majority of patients reported stable or better QOL at 3 months for all domains in the 3 questionnaires. On multivariable analysis, uninvolved liver was a significant predictor of worse fatigue (pZ0.009) and appetite (pZ0.004). Conclusion(s): SABR offers a non-invasive mean of ablating liver metastases with minimal impact on QOL. Our data suggests that some dosimetric parameters are predictors of worse QOL outcome.

This may result in high rates of acute toxicity or the need to reduce the dose below levels required for tumor ablation. AMR‐SBRT may improve the therapeutic ratio using daily reoptimization to account for variation in tumor/OAR anatomy. We report results of the first prospective trial investigating the role of AMRSBRT in decreasing acute toxicity while maintaining an ablative dose for abdominal malignancies. Materials/Methods: Eighteen patients with oligometastatic or unresectable primary abdominal malignancy, enrolled in a prospective phase I study (NCT02264886) from 2/2015 to 12/2015, underwent AMR‐SBRT using a commercially available, integrated MR‐IGRT unit. Treated sites included the liver (5 metastatic, 3 HCC, 1 IHC) and non‐liver abdomen (5 pancreas, 4 oligometastatic). The prescription was 50 Gy/5 fractions (goal of 95% PTV coverage), subject to strict maximum point dose (0.5cc) constraints for abdominal OAR including stomach (<33 Gy), duodenum (<35 Gy) and small bowel (<30 Gy). During each fraction, physician segmentation of a daily volumetric MR was performed. The initial plan was applied to daily anatomy to evaluate for OAR constraint violation, or if dose escalation (DE) beyond 10 Gy/fraction was possible while maintaining OAR constraints. If either criterion existed, online reoptimization, QA, and delivery of a new plan were performed while the patient remained on the table. Quality of life (QOL) via the EORTC QLQ‐C30 was recorded pre‐treatment and at 6 weeks and 6 months posttreatment. Local freedom from progression (LFFP) was evaluated by RECIST criteria. Results: All patients tolerated therapy, with a median on‐table time of 77 minutes. Each patient received 31 adapted fraction and 83% of fractions were adapted. Indications for adaptation included OAR constraint violation (n = 68), DE (n = 3), or both (n = 1). When DE was possible (n = 12), median dose per fraction was 15 Gy. LFFP by RECIST criteria at 3 months was 88% (n = 17). Median follow‐up was 6.3 months. There were no grade 3 toxicities at 6 weeks or 3 months. There was no change in pretreatment and 6‐week global QOL scores (P = 0.23); 6‐month QOL, LFFP, and survival data have not yet matured. Conclusion: AMR‐SBRT is feasible, allowing for dose escalation and/or OAR sparing with low toxicity and promising efficacy. Daily imaging revealed motion of the GI tract that frequently required re‐planning to avoid constraint violation.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of SBRT for lung and liver oligo-recurrent lesions and evaluate predictive factors for local control and prognosis. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients who presented with 1-3 matachronous lung or liver metastases, and treated with SBRT between May 2013 and March 2016 at a single institution. All patients harbored a controlled primary lesion. Patients with < 6 months of follow-up were excluded. Local control, progression free survival, and overall survival rates were analyzed according to the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. Univariable log-rank and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to clarify predictive factors for local control and prognosis. Toxicity was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients with a total of 70 and 44 lung and liver lesions were included. The median follow-up period was 21 (range, 7-43) months. The 1-year local control, progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 89, 38 and 96%, respectively. Smaller gross tumor volume and additional chemotherapy after SBRT were significant predictive factors for better local control (p = 0.005 and p = 0.047), and the presence of a single metastatic lesion was a significant factor of good progression free survival (p = 0.008). Additional chemotherapy after SBRT was not a significant predictive factor but conferred to better overall survival (p = 0.078). Among colorectal cancer patients, post SBRT chemotherapy was significantly associated with better OS (p = 0.025). Over grade 3 adverse event was seen in only one patient. CONCLUSION: SBRT is a safe and effective treatment for patients with lung and liver oligo-recurrence. Additional chemotherapy after SBRT improved local control, and single metastatic lesion was a significant predictive factor of better PFS in this study.

random-journal.pdf,LivM27,,2015,English,LIV.M:#5,Advances in radiation therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma,"External-beam radiation therapy (RT), including photon and proton radiation, has long been integrated into multi-modality treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). External RT is used with either long-fractionated treatments or higher dose-per-fraction and fewer fraction-number stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Fewer fractions of RT require the high demand of precise immobilization, respiratory control, and image guidance for each treatment. Notably, the altered patterns of failure of intra-/extra-hepatic metastasis are less frequently seen with the use of hypofractionated RT or SBRT in 2 weeks compared with long-course RT in 5-6 weeks. The local control of the irradiated hepatic tumor therefore becomes the concern of adding RT into the treatments for HCC. Most patients referred for RT have large-size HCC refractory to ablation or embolization, or tumor invading portal vein or inferior vena cava. Rare complete response and most partial response or stable disease of irradiated tumors indicate the sublethal effect of RT. Higher-intensity RT by higher dose-perfraction and fewer fraction-number SBRT, and by higher-dose proton therapy are more frequently used to improve the control of irradiated tumor. The demanding need to develop radiation sensitizers, such as histone deacetylase inhibitor, aurora kinase inhibitor, PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, and Sonic Hedgehog inhibitor may be the basis of future clinical trial to further improve the role of RT in HCC treatment. Besides, the appropriate biomarkers, either imaging or serum/ plasma biomarkers, may give the early predictive or prognostic signals for better selecting patients and planning further salvage treatment. The proposed RTOG trial to combine RT with sorafenib for advanced-stage HCC and the evolving idea of the trial adding RT adjuvant to incomplete embolization/ablation are pending to provide new knowledge of integrating RT into the HCC treatment guidelines.",exclusion,Narrative,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000367745

The trial was aimed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 5 fractions SBRT treatment Material and Methods The clinical trial design was very articulated including seven arms (Table). Each patient was sequentially enrolled in a given study arm, according to tumor site and clinical stage. The total dose, prescribed to the target isocenter (ICRU 62), ranged from 20 to 50 Gy (biologic effective dose=28-100 Gy, alpha/beta=10) according to different arms of the protocol; the doses per fraction ranged from 4 to 10 Gy along 5 days. Dose escalation was based primarily on acute and subacute toxicity because late toxicity can occur months or years later. Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) were defined as any treatmentrelated non haematological adverse effects rated as Grade > 3 or any haematological toxicity rated as > 4 by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria. The maximum tolerable dose has been reached if one third of patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a retrospective review of patients treated with SRS to the spine for metastatic HCC, RCC, melanoma, and sarcoma between January 2007 and May 2014. Radiographic assessments of LC, overall survival, and patient-reported pain control were analyzed as univariable analyses and with various patient- and treatment-related parameters as multivariable analyses (MVA). RESULTS: Of the 96 patients treated with SRS, 41 patients had radioresistant histologies, including 18 HCC, 1 mixed HCC and cholangiocarcinoma, 15 RCC, 6 melanoma, and 1 leiomyosarcoma. Extraosseous disease was present in 63% of patients (74% in HCC; 55% in non-HCC; P = not significant). Spinal cord compression was present in 29% of patients (32% in HCC; 27% in non-HCC; P = not significant), and 24% of patients had decompressive surgery before SRS (26% in HCC; 23% in non-HCC; P = not significant). With a median follow-up time of 8.7 months, the actuarial 3-, 6-, and 12-month LC rates were 71%, 61%, 41%, respectively, for HCC, and 94%, 94%, and 85%, respectively, for non-HCC. The median time to local failure was 3 months for HCC and 11 months for non-HCC. On MVA, there was a strong trend toward inferior LC with HCC (P = .059). Of the 28 patients with pretreatment pain, pain relief was achieved in 93% of patients, but the 2 patients who did not experience pain relief both had HCC. The actuarial 3-, 6-, and 12-month pain control rates were 68%, 51%, 17%, respectively, for HCC, and 100%, 89%, and 89%, respectively, for non-HCC (P = .023), and remained significant on MVA (P = .034). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other radioresistant histologies, HCC has inferior LC and pain relief after SRS.

Studies investigating this association for patients undergoing resection of bone metastases are scarce and controversial. PURPOSE: We assessed (1) whether exposure to perioperative allogeneic blood transfusions was associated with decreased survival after surgery for spinal metastases and (2) if there was a dose-response relationship per unit of blood transfused. Additionally, we explored the risk factors associated with survival after surgery for spinal metastases. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This is a retrospective cohort study from two university medical centers. PATIENT SAMPLE: There were 649 patients who had operative treatment for metastatic disease of the spine between 2002 and 2014. Patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma were also included. We excluded patients with a revision procedure, kyphoplasty, vertebroplasty, and radiosurgery alone. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measure was survival after surgery. The date of death was obtained from the Social Security Death Index and medical charts. METHODS: Blood transfusions within 7 days before and 7 days after surgery were considered perioperative. A multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the relationship between allogeneic blood transfusion as exposure versus non-exposure, and subsequently as continuous value; we accounted for clinical, laboratory, and treatment factors. RESULTS: Four hundred fifty-three (70%) patients received perioperative blood transfusions, and the median number of units transfused was 3 (interquartile range: 2-6). Exposure to perioperative blood transfusion was not associated with decreased survival after accounting for all explanatory variables (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.80-1.31; p=.841). Neither did we find a dose-response relationship (HR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.98-1.04; p=.420). Other factors associated with worse survival were older age, more severe comorbidity status, lower preoperativehemoglobin level, higher white blood cell count, higher calcium level, primary tumor type, previous systemic therapy, poor performance status, presence of lung, liver, or brain metastasis, and surgical approach. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative allogeneic blood transfusions were not associated with decreased survival after surgery for spinal metastases. More liberal transfusion policies might be warranted for patients undergoing surgery for spinal metastasis, although careful consideration is needed as other complications may occur.",exclusion,"Worng intervention, wrong patients, other study design",,10.1016/j.spinee.2016.03.043

In a previous pilot cohort, we demonstrated that Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) significantly increases lung volume, reduces tumor motion, distancing the heart from the chest wall, and reduces radiation exposure to normal tissues. Here we report the dosimetric benefit and safety results of expanded cohort of this prospective clinical trial of CPAP in radiotherapy. Materials/Methods: This IRB approved clinical trial was conducted between December 2013 and 2016, NCT02324530. Inclusion criteria included adult patients with primary or secondary lung tumors, left sided breast cancer and liver metastases referred for RT. Following informed consent and brief training, subjects underwent 4D simulation twice: without CPAP (free-breathing (FB)) and with CPAP. PTV was created by 0.5 cm expansion of the ITV. Treatment was planned using a programming interface AAA algorithm on both simulations. Volumetric and dosimetric parameters were compared with Student's test (categorical variables) and linear regression (continuous variables). Toxicity was reported according to CTCAE V4. Result(s): 49 patients were recruited. 6 patients withdrew consent prior to simulation, 3 subjects withdrew due to CPAP mask discomfort. Complete comparative volumetric data with and without CPAP was available for 40 patients, and dosimetric comparison was available for 24 patients for whom treatment plans were prepared on both simulations. Mean age 62 (range 31-86), median ECOG: 0 (range 0-3), 28 patients were treated with SBRT and 12 with standard fractionation. 20 patients treated for single lesions and 20 patients multiple lesions. Ultimately, 27 patients were treated with CPAP and 13 with FB. Median lung volume increased to 3909 cc vs 2915 cc, relative increase of 37% (p< 0.001). Increased lung volume with CPAP was independent of age, BMI, gender, COPD, smoking status and heart disease. Tumor motion was decreased as reflected in a median reduction of PTV by 19% (p<0.001). Mean lung dose by reduced by 15%, bilateral lung V20 by 20%, lung V5 by 11%, heart V5 by 16% (p<0.01 for all). All patients treated with CPAP tolerated the intervention without complications. Grade 2 pneumonitis was reported in 4/40 patients (cough), grade 3/40 pneumonitis in 1/40 patient, rib fractures in 3/40 patients, and grade 2 esophagitis in 4/40 patients. Conclusion(s): In this prospective clinical trial, the largest to date, use of CPAP was associated with significant geometric, volumetric, and dosimetric benefits compared to free breathing. CPAP was safe and well tolerated by most patients, and reduces radiation exposure to normal organs.Copyright © 2019",exclusion,Wrong intervention,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.06.432

METHODS: The study enrolled 178 HCC patients initially treated with TACE between 2006 and 2011. Patients were included if they had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage 0 or A, ≤3 nodules with a total sum of longest diameter ≤10 cm, Child-Turcotte-Pugh score of ≤7, no major vessel invasion, and no extra-hepatic metastases. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients achieved a complete response to TACE (group 1). Among those with incomplete response, 47 patients received other curative treatments (group 2), 37 received SABR (group 3), and 70 received non-curative treatments (group 4). The 2-year overall survival (OS) rates for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 88 %, 81 %, 73 %, and 54 %, respectively. The corresponding 5-year OS rates were 50 %, 58 %, 53 %, and 28 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with SABR after incomplete TACE had similar survival outcomes to those achieving complete response to TACE or receiving curative treatments. However, patients receiving non-curative treatments had significantly lower survival rates than the other groups. Therefore, if SABR was indicated at the initial diagnosis, it might be recommended after TACE failure.",exclusion,Wrong intervention,SABR applied after TACE (different tempo),10.1186/s13014-016-0597-7

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2011 and 2016, a total of 198 patients with 280 lung, liver, and abdominal tumors were treated with BMC-SBRT. The median gross tumor volume (GTV) was 12.3 cc (0.1-372.0 cc). Medians of mean GTV BED(α/β =)(10) (Gy) (BED = biological effective dose) was 148.5 Gy(10) (31.5-233.3 Gy(10)) and prescribed planning target volume (PTV) BED(α/β =)(10) (Gy) was 89.7 Gy(10) (28.8-151.2 Gy(10)), respectively. We analyzed overall survival (OS) and local control (LC) based on various factors, including BEDs with α/β ratios of 15 Gy (lung metastases), 21 Gy (primary lung tumors), and 27 Gy (liver metastases). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 10.4 months (2.0-59.0 months). The 2‑year actuarial LC was 100 and 86.4% for primary early and advanced stage lung tumors, respectively, 100% for lung metastases, 82.2% for liver metastases, and 90% for extrapulmonary extrahepatic metastases. The 2‑year OS rate was 47.9% for all patients. In uni- and multivariate analysis, comparatively lower PTV prescription dose (equivalence of 3 × 12-13 Gy) and higher average GTV dose (equivalence of 3 × 18 Gy) to current practice were significantly associated with LC. For OS, Karnofsky performance score (100%), gender (female), and SBRT without simultaneous chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors. Grade 3 side effects were rare (0.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Robotic guided BMC-SBRT can be considered a safe and effective treatment for solid tumors in moving organs. To reach sufficient local control rates, high average GTV doses are necessary.

random-journal.pdf,LivM34,"Nakayama, Y",2017,English,LIV.M:#5;LIV.P:#5,Carbon-ion therapy,"Introduction: Approximately 68 particle therapy facilities are in operation worldwide. Among them, only 11 offer carbon-ion treatment (5 in Japan, 2 in Germany, 2 in China, 1 in Italy, and 1 in Austria; 6 also offer proton), and the remainder offer proton treatment. More than 150,000 patients have been treated with particle therapy worldwide from 1954 to 2015, 87% of which were treated with protons and 13% with carbon-ions or other particles (from the website of the Particle Therapy Co-Operative Group: http://www.ptcog.ch/). The National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS) in Chiba, Japan, has been treating cancer with high-energy carbon-ions since 1994. The majority of patients curatively treated with carbon-ions worldwide were treated at NIRS.1 Through the data they have generated, carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been suggested as safe and efficacious. Here, I review those results and discuss this modern technology. Characteristics of CIRT In comparison with photon radiotherapy, CIRT has better dose distribution to tumors while simultaneously minimizing dose to surrounding normal tissues. Moreover, CIRT offers potential advantages over protons, which have similar dose distribution benefits. Carbon-ions provide a better physical dose distribution, because lateral scattering is lessened, and offer a higher relative biological effectiveness with a lower oxygen enhancement ratio; desirable features for eradication of radioresistant, hypoxic tumors. This difference between densely ionizing nuclei and sparsely ionizing x-rays/protons further offers potential radiobiological advantages, such as reduced repair capacity in irradiated tumors, decreased cell-cycle dependence, and possibly stronger immunological responses. CIRT of early NSCLC Surgical resection with lobectomy has been the standard treatment of choice for early-stage NSCLC. From a Japanese lung cancer registry study of 11,663 surgical cases in 2004, overall survival (OS) rates at 5 years for stages IA and IB disease were 82.0% and 66.8%, respectively.2 Radiotherapy is an option for patients who are not suitable for surgery or refuse it. Recently, hypofractionated radiotherapy is regarded as an alternative for surgery in cases of localized NSCLC, employing x-ray stereotactic body radiotherapy, protons, or CIRT. Regarding CIRT, for peripheral stage I NSCLC, the number of fractions delivered per treatment at NIRS has been reduced through consecutive trials from 18 to 9, then 4, and finally to a single fraction.3-7 This latest result, conducted via dose escalation study, was recently reported by NIRS, demonstrating results comparable to those with previous fractionated regimens.8 The Japan Carbon-ion Radiation Oncology Study Group (J-CROS) has further reported that the results of a multi-institutional retrospective study of CIRT for stage I NSCLC were similar with the results of previous single institutional reports.9 The results of CIRT in stage IA NSCLC are similar to the best stereotactic body radiotherapy results reported worldwide. For stage IB disease, CIRT results appear tentatively superior to those reported for photon stereotactic body radiotherapy in terms of local control and lung toxicity, but will require randomized controlled trials to verify. Despite this high local control, however, disease-specific survival is much lower in stage IB than in stage IA, due to distant metastatic recurrence. A combination of CIRT with systemic therapy is therefore essential to improve survival. CIRT demonstrates a better dose distribution than both SBRT and proton therapy in most cases of early-stage lung cancer. Therefore, CIRT may be safer for treating patients with adverse conditions such as large tumors, central tumors, and poor pulmonary function. CIRT of locally advanced NSCLC There has only been one report regarding CIRT for locally advanced NSCLC. A prospective nonrandomized phase I/II study of carbon-ion therapy in a favorable subset of locally advanced NSCLC was reported from NIRS.10 They showed that short-course carbon-ion monotherapy (72GyE/16Fr) was associated with manageable toxicity and encouraging local control rates. Among them, cT3-4N0M0 patients were particularly favorable candidates for CIRT. However, there is a relative dearth of evidence for CIRT in the setting of locally advanced NSCLC, and more trials, including those combined with systemic immunological or chemotherapy agents, are required. Future Directions: We have organized a multi-institutional study group of carbon-ion radiation oncology in Japan (J-CROS) and have been conducting a number of trials involving a multitude of tumor sites. A number are emerging as particularly attractive for CIRT with possibility of new levels of achievable disease control, including in NSCLC, head and neck cancer, locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, locally recurrent rectal cancer, as well as others. The outcomes of CIRT for stage I NSCLC in Japanese multi-institutional datasets were retrospectively analyzed. As a result, CIRT is considered a low-risk and effective treatment option for patients with stage I NSCLC. Confirmative multiinstitutional prospective studies via J-CROS began last year, so as to validate these results.",exclusion,Wrong intervention,,

With regard to CIRT, for peripheral stage I NSCLC, the number of fractions was reduced in different trials from 18 to 9, then 4, and finally to a single fraction at NIRS (Table).

Moreover, concurrent systemic therapy is essential to improve survival for locally advanced NSCLC. Future directions: We organized a multi-institutional study group of carbon-ion radiation oncology in Japan (J-CROS). This group is currently conducting trials on several tumor sites which are thought to be most attractive for CIRT, including NSCLC, head and neck disease, locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, locally recurrent rectal cancer, and others. The outcomes of CIRT for stage I NSCLC at all Japanese carbon centers were pooled and retrospectively analyzed.

METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) from 2004-2014 on patients with non-metastatic HCC. Treatment modalities assessed were surgical resection, transplantation, ablation, radioembolization, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), single-agent chemotherapy, and multi-agent chemotherapy. Facilities were dichotomized at the median of the listed treatment modalities. RESULTS: There were a total of 112,512 patients with non-metastatic HCC. Of a total of 1,230 sites, 830 (67.5%) used four or fewer modalities. Average survival for patients treated at facilities using fewer modalities was 12.0 and 23.5 months for those treated at facilities with more modalities [hazard ratio (HR) =0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.51-0.53, P<0.001]. After adjusting for facility volume, liver function, tumor and patient characteristics and other prognostic factors in a multivariable Cox model, treatment at a multi-modality facility still provided a survival advantage (HR =0.60, 95% CI: 0.52-0.70, P<0.001). This benefit also persisted after propensity score matching. Sensitivity analysis varying the cut point from 2 to 6 modalities for dichotomization showed that the benefit persisted. Subgroup stratified analyses based on stage showed that the benefit in OS was highest for patients with stage I and II (P≤0.002) but was not significant for stage III or IVa.

METHODS: We reviewed the treatment and outcomes of all patients who received SBRT for primary liver cancer (PLC) and metastatic liver tumors between July 2004 and November 2015 at our institution. The cHBT was defined as isotropic expansions (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25mm) from the portal vein (PV). Doses were converted to biologically effective doses by using the standard linear quadratic model with α/β of 10 (BED(10)). HBT was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 13months. Out of the 130 patients with complete follow-up records analyzed, 60 (46.1%) had liver metastases, 40 (30.8%) had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 26 (20%) had cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and 4 (3.1%) patients other PLC histologies. Thirty-three (25.4%) grade 2+ and 28 (21.5%) grade 3+ HBT were observed. Grade 3+ HBT was seen in 13 patients (50%) with CCA, 7 patients (17.5%) with HCC and 7 (11.7%) patients with liver metastases. SBRT doses to the cHBT were highly associated with HBT, but only for PLC patients when analyzed by histological subtype. The 15mm expansion from the PV (cHBT(15)) proved to be an appropriate surrogate for the cHBT. The strongest cHBT(15) dose predictors for G3+ HBT for PLC were the V(BED10)40⩾37cc (p<0.0001) and the V(BED10)30⩾45cc (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: SBRT doses to the cHBT are associated with occurrence of HBT only in PLC patients. Limiting the dose to the cHBT to V(BED10)40<37cc and V(BED10)30<45cc when treating PLC patients with SBRT may reduce the risk of HBT.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.1016/j.radonc.2016.10.024

All patients were required to have Child Pugh status B7 or less prior to hepatic radiation. Total liver volume, gross tumour volume (GTV), normal liver volume (total liver volume-GTV) was determined. First follow-up scans were used to determine changes, if any, in liver volume. As the dose prescription of each patient was individualised, biologically equivalent dose (BED) was calculated. Univariate analysis (Fisher's exact test) was carried out to determine correlation if any between liver volume changes and total dose, GTV at treatment, use of systemic chemotherapy, primary tumour type, baseline liver function status, age and viral marker status. P P<0.05 was considered significant. Result(s): 13 patients received either SBRT or concurrent chemoradiation.

The aim of the work is to evaluate the effectiveness of stereotactic radiosurgery performed on LINAC linear accelerator and the occurrence of postoperative complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with ciliary body melanoma treated with stereotactic radiosurgery on linear accelerator in the period 1/2011 to 12/2016 in Slovakia. RESULTS: From 1/2011 to 12/2016 a group of 27 patients with melanoma of the ciliary body underwent one day session stereotactic radiosurgery irradiation on linear accelerator (SRCH). Primary enucleation was indicated in 10 (37 %) patients. A group of 17 (63 %) patients were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery. In a group of 17 patients indicated for SRCH, 7 (41 %) were diagnosed in T1 stage, 8 (47 %) in T2 stage. In 2 (12 %) patients who refused primary enucleation, palliative irradiation was indicated in T3 stage, and later metastases appeared in liver and systemic chemotherapy was indicated. The therapeutic dose in all patients was TD 35 Gy, TD max 42 Gy. The mean age of patients at the time of irradiation was 60.8, the youngest patient was 40 and the oldest was 80 years old. The follow-up period was 12 months to 5 years. CONCLUSION: Currently, in Slovakia, the only irradiation possibility to treat ciliary body melanoma is stereotactic radiosurgery.

We sought to identify prognostic criteria in oligometastatic patients undergoing definitive hypofractionated image-guided radiotherapy (HIGRT). METHODS: Exclusively extracranial oligometastatic patients treated with HIGRT were pooled. Characteristics including age, sex, primary tumor type, interval to metastatic diagnosis, number of treated metastases and organs, metastatic site, prior systemic therapy for primary tumor treatment, prior definitive metastasis-directed therapy, and systemic therapy for metastasis associated with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and treated metastasis control (TMC) were assessed by the Cox proportional hazards method. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) identified prognostic risk strata for OS and PFS based on pretreatment factors. RESULTS: 361 patients were included. Primary tumors included non-small cell lung (17%), colorectal (19%), and breast cancer (16%). Three-year OS was 56%, PFS was 24%, and TMC was 72%. On multivariate analysis, primary tumor, interval to metastases, treated metastases number, and mediastinal/hilar lymph node, liver, or adrenal metastases were associated with OS. Primary tumor site, involved organ number, liver metastasis, and prior primary disease chemotherapy were associated with PFS. OS RPA identified five classes: class 1: all breast, kidney, or prostate cancer patients (BKP) (3-year OS 75%, 95% CI 66-85%); class 2: patients without BKP with disease-free interval of 75+ months (3-year OS 85%, 95% CI 67-100%); class 3: patients without BKP, shorter disease-free interval, ≤ two metastases, and age < 62 (3-year OS 55%, 95% CI 48-64%); class 4: patients without BKP, shorter disease-free interval, ≥ three metastases, and age < 62 (3-year OS 38%, 95% CI 24-60%); class 5: all others (3-year OS 13%, 95% CI 5-35%). Higher biologically effective dose (BED) (p < 0.01) was associated with OS. CONCLUSIONS: We identified clinical factors defining oligometastatic patients with favorable outcomes, who we hypothesize are most likely to benefit from metastasis-directed therapy.",exclusion,Wrong intervention,,10.1371/journal.pone.0195149

In this secondary analysis, we sought to identify clinical and molecular predictors of local failure. Materials/Methods: Patients were enrolled on an NCI sponsored, prospective, multi-institutional, single arm phase 2 study (NCT 01239381). Key eligibility were ECOG PS 0-2, age 18+, 1-4 liver metastases, and expected survival >3 months. There was no upper size limit; however, pts must have >=800 cm3 of uninvolved liver. Patients were treated with proton beam RT in 5 fractions to a total dose of 30-50 GyE, with individualized dose prescription based on dose received by non-target liver. Eligible patients from this phase 2 study formed the basis of this secondary analysis. Clinical/treatment characteristics evaluated include primary disease site (colorectal vs. pancreaticobiliary vs esophagogastric vs other), histology (adenocarcinoma vs SCC vs other), disease status at consent (progressing on chemo vs stable/ responding), number of lesions treated, sum of the longest tumor diameters and RT dose. Mutational analysis was performed with a multiplexed clinical assay on nucleic acid from formalin-fixed tissue (SNaPshot), which tests for >150 mutations across 15 commonly mutated cancer genes. Cox proportional hazards models were performed to evaluate associations of these study variables on local control. Result(s): From 2009-2014, 91 patients were enrolled into the study, of whom 90 were analyzed. With a median follow-up of 11 months (range, 0.3-41), the 1-year local control was 77%. Local control did not differ with respect to: primary disease site (P = .242); histology (P = .534); disease status at consent (P=.483); number of lesions treated (P=.786), sum of the longest tumor diameters (P = .167), or RT dose (P = .699). Mutational analysis was performed on 64 of the 90 patients. Among them, the following were present: 31 (48%) had no mutations found; 15 (23%) KRAS; 0 (0%) BRAF; 1 (2%) NRAS; 5 (8%) PIK3CA; 13 (20%) TP53, 3 (5%) HER2; 1 (2%) RET, 1 (2%) EGFR; and 1 (2%) MET. Presence of a KRAS mutation conferred a significantly higher risk of local failure among treated lesions compared to tumors without KRAS mutation (HR = 3.3, P = .006). One-year local control among patients with and without KRAS mutations were 39% and 79%, respectively. Neither presence of the PIK3CA mutation (P = .883) nor TP53 mutation (P = .111) were associated with local control. Conclusion(s): In our prospective phase 2 study of SBRT for liver metastases, KRAS mutant tumors had significantly higher rates of local failure compared tumors without KRAS mutations.

The potential advantage of using high frequency jet-ventilation technique (HFJV) during the procedure is by minimising the amplitude of respiration-related upper-abdominal organs movements. The aim of this clinical methodological trial was to establish whether HFJV would give less ventilatory induced liver movements than conventional ventilation, during stereotactic navigated ablation of liver metastases under open surgery. Methods: Five consecutive patients scheduled for elective, open liver ablation under general propofol and remifentanil anaesthesia were included in the study protocol. During the stereotactic targeting of the tumours, HFJV was chosen for intraoperative lung ventilation. For tracking of liver movement, a rigid marker shield was placed on the liver surface and tracked with an optical position measurement system. A 4D position of the marker shield was measured for HFJV and conventional tidal volume lung ventilation (TV). At each time point the magnitude of liver displacement was calculated as an Euclidean distance between translational component of the marker shield's 3D position and previously estimated centroid of the translational motion. Results: The mean Euclidean liver displacement was 0.80 (0.10) mm for HFJV and 2,90 (1.03) mm for TV with maximum displacement going as far as 12 mm on standard ventilation (p=0.0001). Conclusion: HFJV is a valuable lung ventilation method for patients undergoing stereotactic surgical procedures in general anaesthesia when reduction of organ displacement is crucial.",exclusion,Wrong intervention,,10.12688/f1000research.14873.2

The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of brain metastases from HCC, to evaluate the predictive factors, and to assess the efficacy of gamma knife surgery (GKS). METHOD: A retrospective study was performed on patients with brain metastases from HCC who were treated at Tokyo Gamma Unit Center from 2005 to 2014. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were identified. The median age at diagnosis of brain metastases was 67.0 years. Fifteen patients were male and four patients were female. Six patients were infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Two patients were infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Eleven patients were not infected with HBV or HCV. The median interval from the diagnosis of HCC to brain metastases was 32.0 months. The median number of brain metastases was two. The median Karnofsky performance score at first GKS was 70. The median survival time following brain metastases was 21.0 weeks. Six-month and 1-year survival rates were 41.2 and 0%, respectively. One month after GKS, no tumor showed progressive disease. The HBV infection (positive vs. negative) was significantly associated with survival according to univariate analysis (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The patients having brain metastases from HCC had poor prognosis and low performance state. Therefore, GKS is an acceptable option for controlling brain metastases from HCC because GKS is noninvasive remedy and local control is reasonable.",exclusion,Wrong patients,Metastasis is from liver to brain (not the other way round),10.1007/s00701-018-3504-1
random-journal.pdf,LivM45,"Gargett, M",2019,eng,LIV.M:#2,Clinical impact of removing respiratory motion during liver SABR.,"BACKGROUND: Liver tumors are subject to motion with respiration, which is typically accounted for by increasing the target volume. The prescription dose is often reduced to keep the mean liver dose under a threshold level to limit the probability of radiation induced liver toxicity. A retrospective planning study was performed to determine the potential clinical gains of removal of respiratory motion from liver SABR treatment volumes, which may be achieved with gating or tumor tracking. METHODS: Twenty consecutive liver SABR patients were analysed. The treated PTV included the GTV in all phases of respiration (ITV) with a 5 mm margin. The goal prescription was 50Gy/5# (BED 100 Gy(10)) but was reduced by 2.5 Gy increments to meet liver dose constraints. Elimination of motion was modelled by contouring the GTV in the expiration phase only, with a 5 mm PTV margin. All patients were replanned using the no-motion PTV and tumor dose was escalated to higher prescription levels where feasible given organ-at-risk constraints. For the cohort of patients with metastatic disease, BED gains were correlated to increases in tumour control probability (TCP). The effect of the gradient of the TCP curve on the magnitude of TCP increase was evaluated by repeating the study for an additional prescription structure, 54Gy/3# (BED 151 Gy(10)). RESULTS: Correlation between PTV size and prescribed dose exists; PTVs encompassing < 10% of the liver could receive the highest prescription level. A monotonically increasing correlation (Spearman's rho 0.771, p = 0.002) between the degree of PTV size reduction and motion vector magnitude was observed for GTV sizes <100cm(3). For 11/13 patients initially planned to a decreased prescription, tumor dose escalation was possible (5.4Gy(10)-21.4Gy(10) BED) using the no-motion PTV. Dose escalation in excess of 20 Gy(10) increased the associated TCP by 5% or more. A comparison of TCP gains between the two fractionation schedules showed that, for the same patient geometry, the absolute increase in BED was the overarching factor rather than the gradient of the TCP curve. CONCLUSIONS: In liver SABR treatments unable to be prescribed optimal dose due to exceeding mean liver thresholds, eliminating respiratory motion allowed dose escalation in the majority of patients studied and substantially increased TCP.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.1186/s13014-019-1300-6
random-journal.pdf,LivM46,"K., Hara",2018,English,LIV.M:#3,"Clinical outcomes after treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma, stereotactic body radiotherapy vs radiofrequency ablation: A propensity score-matched analysis","Background: Patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer stage 0-A can benefit from potentially curative treatment such as resection, transplantation or ablation. Currently, deciding a therapeutic plan has become increasingly complex and requires consideration of multiple factors. In the US, a multidisciplinary liver tumor board has been becoming the standard and a key component of best practice protocol, though the treatment decision is still indefinite and largely depends on patient comorbidities and institutional preference or resources. Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) is expected to be another treatment option for early-stage HCC. Prospective studies of SBRT for small HCC showed high local control rates. In this study, we evaluated local control rate and adverse event rate after Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and SBRT, and overall survival (OS) after propensity score matching (PSM). Method(s): Among patients treated with RFA at Yokohama City University Medical Center or SBRT at Ofuna Chuo Hospital between 2012 and 2016, patients who met all of the following criteria were eligible for this study: (1) HCC diagnosed with pathologically or graphically on computed tomography or MRI; (2) unfeasible, difficult or refusal to undergo liver resection; (3) tumor number is 3 or less; (4) maximum tumor diameter is 3cm or less; (5) no extrahepatic metastasis; (6) curative intent. HCC which is located within 5mm from hepatic artery, hepatic vein or portal vein is classified as high-risk lesion. PSM was performed to reduce selection bias between RFA and SBRT group. Result(s): 231 patients, 474 tumors for RFA, and 143 patients, 220 tumors for SBRT were eligible for this study. Four-year local recurrence rate for all tumors in RFA and SBRT group were 12.9% (95% CI, 9.9-16.2%) and 5.3% (95% CI, 2.7-9.2%), respectively (p=0.0009). In the high-risk lesion, local recurrence rate were 13.3% (95% CI, 5.8-24.0%) and 5.3% (95% CI, 1.7-9.6%), p=0.03. Four-year OS with PSM were 61.8% (95% CI, 50.0-71.5%) and 56.9% (95% CI, 44.8-67.3%), p=0.64. There is no difference between RFA and SBRT in liver related death rate (26.9% and 34.0%, p=0.43) or in Child-Pugh score change in 12 months (p=0.131). Conclusion(s): Four-year local recurrence rate after SBRT for HCC is superior to that of RFA. Especially, for the tumors adjacent to large vessels, SBRT is superior to RFA in local control rate.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2009 to 2015, 47 lesions from 28 patients were treated with SABR and retrospectively analyzed. All patients had oligometastatic (93%) or oligoprogressive (7%) disease. Primary cancer diagnoses were 15 ovarian, 8 endometrial, 2 cervical, 2 vaginal, and 1 uterine carcinosarcoma. Treatment was delivered using a median of 5 fractions to a median total dose of 40 Gy. Targets were grouped by treatment site and assessed for response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1. Mean biologically effective dose and pre-SABR tumor size were compared with response. Progression-free survival (PFS) was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis, and toxicity outcomes were graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 12.8 months. Target locations were 17% liver, 21% lung, 17% paraaortic node, 26% other node, and 19% pelvic soft tissue. After treatment, 34% of targets were stable (SD), 32% had a partial response (PR), 17% had a complete response (CR), and 17% had progressive disease (PD). No failures occurred in lung or nodal targets. Mean ± standard deviation pre-SABR tumor diameter was 24 ± 22 mm. There was a significant difference in mean size between lesions that had a favorable (SD, PR, and CR) versus unfavorable response (PD) (17.2 vs 57.6 mm, P = 0.0044). Lesions that responded favorably were also more likely to have received a higher biologically effective dose (79.0 vs 59.6 Gy, P = 0.027). Median PFS was 10.8 months, and 1 patient experienced grade 3 toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The SABR is a safe and effective local treatment modality in patients with oligometastatic gynecological disease. Distant progression remains the primary mode of failure in this patient population.

However, because brain metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma are relatively rare, the characteristics of this pathology are poorly understood. METHODS: We carried out a multicenter retrospective study to verify the characteristics of brain metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma in Japan. RESULTS: A total of 38 patients were enrolled and patient characteristics were poor general condition in many patients due to the progression of primary cancers. Stereotactic radiosurgery/stereotactic radiotherapy alone was the most common treatment (39.5%), with best supportive care provided for 10.5%. Median survival was 6 months, the neurological death rate was 28%, and the rate of brain hemorrhage was high (39.5%). Overall survival was analyzed for correlations with age, etiology of chronic liver disease, albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade, RPA classification, control of the primary tumor, number of brain metastases, brain hemorrhage, surgical resection, and radiotherapy. In multivariate analysis, ALBI grade, number of brain metastases and brain hemorrhage showed statistically significant correlation.

METHODS: The hospital records of 45 patients with F-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) positron emission tomography positive, distantly recurrent, oligometastatic gynecological cancer were reviewed. All these patients had a number of target lesions less than 5, with largest diameter less than 6 cm. The treatment was delivered with a TrueBeam LINAC and RapidArc technique, using 10 or 6 MV FFF beams. A total of 70 lesions were treated, and lymph nodes represented the most common site of metastases, followed by lung, liver, and soft tissues. Twenty lesions were treated with one single fraction of 24 Gy and 5 lesions received 27 Gy delivered in 3 fractions, depending on the ability to fulfill adequate target coverage and safe dose/volume constraints for the organ at risk with either regimen. RESULTS: Positron emission tomography scan 3 months after SBRT showed a complete response (CR) in 45 lesions (64.3%), a partial response in 14 (20.0%), a stable disease in 5 (7.1%), and a progressive disease in 6 (8.6%). No lesions in CR after SBRT subsequently progressed. Overall acute toxicity occurred in 13 (28.9%) patients. The most common grade 1 to 2 adverse event was pain (n = 9, 20.0%), followed by nausea and vomiting (n = 5, 11.1%). No grade 3 to 4 acute toxicities occurred, and no late toxicities were observed. Patients who failed to achieve a CR had a 2.37-fold higher risk of progression and a 3.60-fold higher risk of death compared with complete responders (P = 0.04 and P = 0.03, respectively).

METHODS: The clinical data of patients with brain metastatic NSCLC who had EGFR-sensitive mutation and followed between January 2014 and January 2016 was retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups according to their treatment types. Fifty seven patients were treated with SRS combined with EGFR-TKIs, while another 57 patients were treated with WBRT combined with EGFR-TKIs. The clinical efficacy, intracranial progression-free survival (iPFS), systemic progression-free survival (sPFS), overall survival (OS,) and adverse reactions were compared between the two groups. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used for imaging evaluation in both groups and all patients underwent symptomatic treatment such as dehydration or hormone therapy according to the patient's condition. The efficacy was evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (Version 1.1) and adverse reactions were assessed based on the criteria for toxic reaction of anti-cancer drugs of WHO. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in general conditions between the two groups of patients. The median iPFS and median sPFS were similar between the two groups (12.2 months vs. 11.5 months and 10.7 months vs. 9.8 months respectively, p>0.05). The median OS of patients treated with SRS + EGFR-TKIs was significantly longer than in those treated with WBRT + EGFR-TKIs (25.1 months vs. 22.0 months, respectively, p=0.042). No statistically significant differences were found in the objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), the incidence rates of cytopenia, gastrointestinal reaction and liver dysfunction between the two groups (p>0.05). There were 8 cases with radiotherapy-associated grade 3 or higher brain damage in SRS + EGFR-TKIs group compared to 19 cases in those treated with WBRT + EGFR-TKIs, suggesting that the incidence rate of radiation-induced brain injuries in SRS + EGFR-TKIs group was remarkably lower than those in WBRT + EGFR-TKIs group (p=0.026). CONCLUSION: The clinical efficacy of SRS combined with EGFR-TKIs is comparable to that of WBRT combined with EGFR-TKIs in the treatment of NSCLC patients with ≤3 brain metastases and EGFR-sensitive mutation and the OS of patients is longer, with lower toxic side effect and higher safety, hence SRS combined with EGFR-TKIs should be used as the preferred therapeutic regimen.",exclusion,"Wrong patients, wrong intervention",,

METHODS: Between March 2011 and July 2015, 52 patients were treated with SBRT for a total of 91 liver metastases (one to four metastases per patient) with a median GTV volume of 12 cc (min 1 cc, max 372 cc). The optimization of mean GTV dose was prioritized during treatment planning at the potential cost of planning target volume (PTV) coverage reduction while adhering to safe normal tissue constraints. The delivered median GTV biological effective dose (BED10) was 142.1 Gy10 (range, 60.2 Gy10 -165.3 Gy10) and the prescribed PTV BED10 ranged from 40.6 Gy10 to 112.5 Gy10 (median, 86.1 Gy10). We analyzed local control (LC), progression-free interval (PFI), overall survival (OS), and toxicity. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 17 months (range, 2-49 months). The 2-year actuarial LC, PFI, and OS rates were 82.1, 17.7, and 45.0 %, and the median PFI and OS were 9 and 23 months, respectively. In univariate analysis histology (p < 0.001), PTV prescription BED10 (HR 0.95, CI 0.91-0.98, p = 0.002) and GTV mean BED10 (HR 0.975, CI 0.954-0.996, p = 0.011) were predictive for LC. Multivariate analysis showed that only extrahepatic disease status at time of treatment was a significant factor (p = 0.033 and p = 0.009, respectively) for PFI and OS. Acute nausea or fatigue grade 1 was observed in 24.1 % of the patients and only 1 patient (1.9 %) had a side effect of grade ≥ 2. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic real-time motion-compensated SBRT is a safe and effective treatment for one to four liver metastases.

This report is a retrospective study of the clinicopathological features of NET patients with brain metastasis whose tissue diagnosis was made at our hospital. METHODS: Patients with brain metastasis evidenced by clinical records and images were accumulated among 302 patients in whom tissue diagnosis of NETs was made at our hospital between 2008 and 2013. In the patients, the primary lesion, pathological classification, pattern of metastasis, details of treatment, and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Brain metastasis was observed in 31 patients (10.3%). The primary lesion was in the lungs in 26 patients (83.9%), and the mammary glands, esophagus, and uterus in 1 patient each. Primary lesions were unknown in 2 patients, including 1 patient in whom NETs were detected in the lymph nodes alone. Pathological classification of the primary lesion was NET Grade 2 (Ki-67: 3 to 20%) in 3 patients and neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC, Ki-67: ≥ 21%) in 26 patients. The median period from onset of the primary lesion up to diagnosis of brain metastasis was 12.8 months, and the brain lesion preceded brain metastasis in 6 patients. Ten patients had a single metastasis whereas 21 patients had multiple metastases, but no characteristics were observed in their images. Brain metastasis was extirpated in 10 patients. Stereotactic radiotherapy alone was administered in 6 patients, and brain metastasis was favorably controlled in most of the patients with coadministration of cranial irradiation as appropriate. The median survival period from diagnosis of brain metastasis was 8.1 months, and the major cause of death was aggravation of the primary lesion or metastatic lesions in other organs. CONCLUSION: Most of NET patients with brain metastasis showed the primary lesion of NEC in the lungs, and they had multiple metastases to the liver, lymph nodes, bones, and so forth at the time of diagnosis of brain metastasis. The guidelines for accurate diagnosis and treatment of NETs should be immediately established based on further analyses of NET patients with brain metastasis.",exclusion,Wrong patients,,10.1186/s12885-015-1999-x

We performed two prospective trials of individualized adaptive stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the treatment of HCC or liver metastases and herein report the combined results. Materials/Methods: We analyzed all patients accrued and treated with SBRT on two consecutive institutional review board approved prospective trials allowing for individualized adaptive radiation therapy for HCC or liver metastases from 2009-2014. Initial plans limited NTCP <15% for radiation-induced liver disease (RILD). Adaptive SBRT dosing was based on pre-and mid-treatment indocyanine green (ICG) clearance. Patients typically received 3 fractions, followed by a one month treatment break, and then received up to 2 additional fractions based on ICG clearance. We performed univariate and multivariable analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model to identify predictive factors for local control and overall survival. Result(s): One hundred seventeen patients (median age 63 years, range = 33-86) were treated to a total of 169 tumors. Sixty-nine percent of tumors were treated on the first trial. Median pre-SBRT Child-Pugh score was 6 (range = 5-10). Median follow-up post-SBRT was 34 months (95% CI = 25-37). Median tumor size was 2.7 cm (IQR = 1.7-42.3). Seventy-three percent of patients had cirrhosis, and 73% had received prior liver directed therapy. Eighty percent of tumors were HCC. Median dose delivered was 46 Gy (IQR = 34-50) in 5 fractions with a median biologically equivalent dose (BED) of 92 Gy (IQR = 69-107). Fifty-six tumors were treated with only three fractions due to projected ICG of >44% one month post-initial treatment. Local control was not associated with dose, tumor size, or pre-treatment liver-directed therapy. The actuarial 1 and 2-year rates of local control were 98% and 91%. Median OS was 17 months (95% CI = 15-22), and in a multivariable analysis decreased survival was associated with increasing number of prior liver directed therapies (HR = 1.13, P = 0.02), increasing tumor size (cm) (HR = 1.15, P < 0.01), and lower prescription dose (Gy) (HR = 0.97, P < 0.01). There was no difference in LC or OS between patients enrolled on the two trials. Treatment was well tolerated with no cases of RILD. There were 4 treatment-related gastrointestinal bleeds and 4 cases of asymptomatic biliary stenosis. Conclusion(s): Individualized adaptive liver SBRT base on ICG clearance is safe and provides overall excellent local control. Overall survival is significantly associated with the total radiation dose delivered. Our adaptive protocols allow for aggressive treatment that will maximize the probability of durable local control while limiting the likelihood of treatment related toxicity.",exclusion,No comparator,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2016.06.346

Efficacy of the SBRT was measured by CT and/or MRI and used RECIST v1.1 criteria. Result(s): This study enrolled 11 patients. One patient withdrew consent shortly after accrual. Ten patients and 11 liver lesions were treated. Median follow-up was 12.3 months (6.4-25.3 months). Median age was 70 years (44-94 years). There were 7 males and 4 females. All 10 patients completed bevacizumab without dose modifications. All 10 patients completed SBRT (median dose: 54 Gy, range 36-60) in 6 fractions. Median BED10 was 95.57. Acute adverse events attributable to bevacizumab included one grade 3 (hypertension) and two grade 2 (hypertension, paresthesia) toxicities. For SBRT, there were two grade 2 (fatigue, nausea), but no grade 3 toxicities. No late term toxicities attributable to bevacizumab or SBRT have been seen so far. Conclusion(s): In our pilot study, the combination of SBRT and Bevacizumab appeared to be feasible with an acceptable acute toxicity profile and no severe gastrointestinal toxicities.

We also evaluate the prognostic factors of clinical outcome. Material(s) and Method(s): During the period of 2008 to 2015, 64 consecutive intermediate (n = 38) and locally advanced (n = 26) HCC patients that are unsuitable for surgical resection, were treated with single dose of TACE followed by SBRT 3-6 weeks later in our center; their outcomes were prospectively monitored. Those who had Child-Pugh (CP) score > B7, ECOG >=2, extra-hepatic metastasis or infiltrative tumors were excluded in this analysis. SBRT dose, range from 5-8Gy x 6 fractions or 4Gy x 5-10 fractions, were individualized according to normal tissue constraints. Resections were carried out in 12 patients (18.8%) after downsizing of tumor, otherwise no scheduled treatment delivered unless disease progression. Primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points were response rate and toxicity. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 17.9 months (range: 3-96 months). Patients' characteristics were as follows: CP class A/B (n = 60/4); HKLC stage IIb/IIIa/IIIB (n = 34/4/26); BCLC stage B/C (n = 39/25); solitary/oligonodular (2-3)/ multinodular (>3) (n = 35/20/9); tumor size 5-10 cm/ 10.1-15 cm/>15 cm (n = 30/19/15); vascular invasion (n = 18). The median overall survival (OS) was 23.2 months (95% Cl, 15.1-38.6 months). For intermediate (HKLC stage IIb and IIIa) and locally advanced (HKLC stage IIIb) tumor, the median OS was 23.7 months (95% Cl: 19.8-42.3 months) and 16.9 months (95% Cl: 7.6-26.1 months) respectively, the latter compares favorably to historical data of around 6 months. Conversion to resectable tumor after TACE + SBRT (HR = 10.3, 95% Cl 2.7-39.1) and size of lesion (HR = 4.25, 95% Cl 2.04- 8.84) were significant on multivariate analysis in predicting OS. The objective tumor response rate by RECIST criteria was 68.9%. All except one patient (98.4%) completed the planned treatment. Toxicity >= grade 3 was seen in 17.2% of patients, and treatment-related death occurred in two patients (3.1%). 11% of patients without disease progression had decline of CP class at 3 months. No patient developed classical radiationinduced liver disease (RILD). Conclusion(s): Combined TACE and SBRT is an effective and safe treatment in HKLC intermediate or locally advanced HCC that unsuitable for resection. Overall survival is remarkably better than historical data in locally advanced tumor (HKLC stage IIIb).

However, even small doses delivered to the organs at risk (OAR) may induce long-term detriments after radiotherapy. In this study, we investigated the possibility to reduce the risk of radiation-induced secondary cancers with intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT), when used for radiosurgery of liver metastases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten patients, previously treated for liver metastases with photon-beam based stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) were retrospectively planned for radiosurgery with IMPT. A treatment plan comparison was then performed in terms of calculated risk of radiation-induced secondary cancer. The risks were estimated using two distinct models (Dasu et al., 2005; Schneider et al., 2005, 2009). The plans were compared pairwise with a two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test with a significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: Reduced risks for induction of fatal and other types of cancers were estimated for the IMPT plans (p<0.05) with the Dasu et al. MODEL: Using the Schneider et al. model, lower risks for carcinoma-induction with IMPT were estimated for the skin, lungs, healthy part of the liver, esophagus and the remaining part of the body (p<0.05). The risk of observing sarcomas in the bone was also reduced with IMPT (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicate that the risks of radiation-induced secondary cancers after radiosurgery of liver metastases may be reduced, if IMPT is used instead of photon-beam based SBRT.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.1016/j.ejmp.2017.03.019

Nowadays, many therapies have been used for treating this group of HCC patients, including TACE. However, residual tumors after TACE are not uncommon. In conventional, re‐TACE is recommended for managing residual tumors. However, accumulated overall survival is still poor in consecutive TACEs, leading to a low rate of <20% in 5 years. In this regard, radiotherapy has been proved to be effective in managing HCC patients, especially a novel technique named SABR. When compared with conventional‐fractionated radiotherapy, SABR demonstrated better treatment responses with fewer side effects in managing primary or metastatic liver tumors. In the literature, phase I and II trials of TACE plus SABR showed excellent local control rates and promising 1‐ and 2‐year survival rates. However, till now, there is no head‐to‐head comparison between TACE + SABR and consecutive TACEs.",exclusion,,,

We sought to compare outcomes for these 2 modalities. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 2000 to 2015, 161 patients with 282 pathologically diagnosed unresectable liver metastases were treated with RFA (n = 112) or SBRT (n = 170) at a single institution. The primary outcome was freedom from local progression (FFLP). The effect of treatment and covariates on FFLP was modeled using a mixed-effects Cox model with application of inverse probability treatment weighting to adjust for potential imbalances in treatment modality. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 24.6 months. Patients receiving SBRT had larger tumors than those treated with RFA (median, 2.7 cm vs 1.8 cm; P < .01). On univariate analysis, tumor size was associated with worse FFLP for RFA (hazard ratio [HR]; 1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-2.14; P < .01) but not for SBRT (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.76-2.51; P = .3). The 2-year FFLP rate was 88.2% compared with 73.9%, favoring SBRT (P = .06). For tumors ≥2 cm in diameter, SBRT was associated with improved FFLP (HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.09-0.93; P < .01). On multivariate analysis, treatment with SBRT (HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.07-0.62; P = .005) and smaller tumor size (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47-0.91; P = .01) were associated with improved FFLP. The 2-year overall survival rate was 51.1%, with no difference between groups (P = .8). Grade ≥3 treatment-related toxicity was rare, with no difference between SBRT (n = 4) and RFA (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with SBRT or RFA is well tolerated and provides excellent and similar local control for intrahepatic metastases <2 cm in size. For tumors ≥2 cm in size, treatment with SBRT is associated with improved FFLP and may be the preferable treatment.",exclusion,Wrong comparator,,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.12.014

METHODS: A total of 150 patients with 185 hepatocellular carcinoma (≤3 nodules, Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A or B, and no vascular or extrahepatic metastases) were treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy. In principle, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization was combined before stereotactic body radiation therapy (combination group), but some patients were treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy alone. The prescribed dose of stereotactic body radiation therapy was 48 Gy in 4 fractions at the isocenter and 40 Gy in 4 or 5 fractions at the dose covering 95% of the planning target volume. The overall survival, progression-free survival, local progression free survival, and complication rates were retrospectively compared between the groups. Local progression was defined as irradiated tumor growth in dynamic computed tomography follow-up. Tumor responses were assessed according to the Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Treatment-related toxicities were evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. RESULTS: Twenty-eight and 122 patients were enrolled in the stereotactic body radiation therapy alone and combination groups, respectively. The median follow-up periods were 16 and 29 months, respectively. The 2-year overall, progression-free, and local progression-free survival times in stereotactic body radiation therapy alone and combination groups were 78.6% and 80.3% ( P = .6583), 49.0% and 42.9% ( P = .188), and 71.4% and 80.8% ( P = .9661), respectively. The incidence of ≥grade 3 toxicities was 17.9% in stereotactic body radiation therapy alone group and 18.9% in combination group ( P = .903).

In patients who are not suitable for radical surgical treatment, the radiotherapeutic system Cyberknife® is a viable treatment option. The aim of this study is to compare short- and long-term results of both treatment methods. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was performed, focused on patients undergoing treatment of liver malignancies either by surgical resection or by the Cyberknife® system from 2013 to 2016. Only patients treated using a single treatment method were included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 260 patients were analysed; 142 were treated by performing surgical resection and the remaining 118 using Cyberknife® radiotherapy. Median survival was 30.65 months for the surgical resection and 22.93 for the Cyberknife® therapy; median overall survival was 27.63 months. Three-year cumulative survival was 47.4% for the resection and 19.9% for radiotherapy. Kaplan-Meier analysis did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in disease-specific survival between both groups (p=0.082, CI 95%). Results limited only to colorectal liver metastases showed a statistically significant difference in disease-specific survival (p=0.031, CI 95%). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study show statistically indifferent overall disease-specific survival of both groups. However, the significant difference in 3-year survival still indicates a predominant position of surgery in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients with liver malignancies. Nevertheless, Cyberknife® radiotherapy may actually represent a viable treatment alternative, particularly in patients unable to undergo surgical resection, although a longer follow-up period is necessary to obtain more robust results.",inclusion,,,

The Cyberknife (Accuray, Inc, Sunnyvale, CA) is a therapeutic method that allows a tumor target to be subjected to a high radiant dose gradient. This prospective pilot study aimed to demonstrate the concordance of CEUS versus contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) in determining the stability or disease progression of secondary liver lesions after treatment with the Cyberknife. METHODS: Twenty-four patients were consecutively enrolled, and 3 different operators evaluated the CEUS images and the intermodality concordance with CECT. All patients received CEUS at 1 and 2 months after the Cyberknife therapy. The intermodality agreement was evaluated by the Cohen κ coefficient and a multivariate analysis according to the method of Janson and Olsson (Educ Psychol Meas 2001; 61:277-289). RESULTS: Forty secondary liver lesions were detected and treated. Forty-one CECT and 51 CEUS examinations were performed without any adverse events in the 24 patients. The intermodality agreement rates, calculated for the operators as Cohen κ values, were κ = 1.00, 0.881, and 0.767, respectively. The multivariate analysis of intermodality agreement showed an almost perfect value (ι = 0.841). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study found excellent diagnostic correspondence between CEUS and CECT in the evaluation of local disease stability or progression after Cyberknife therapy in liver metastases. These findings suggest that CEUS could play an important role in the surveillance of these patients because of its high accuracy and reproducibility, thus reducing the need for CECT.",exclusion,No comparator,They compare CEUS and CECT in patients treated with Cyberknive,10.1002/jum.14734

This retrospective study aimed to identify the prognostic factors and determine the outcomes of patients with brain metastases from HCC. METHODS: About 86 patients with brain metastases (0.6%) from HCC were identified from two institutions; of them, 32 underwent tumor-removing surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with or without adjuvant whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) (group 1), 30 had WBRT alone (group 2), and 24 received conservative treatment (group 3). Estimates for overall survival (OS) after brain metastases were determined, and clinical prognostic factors were identified. RESULTS: The median OS after development of brain metastases was 50 days. About 75 (87.2%) patients had lung metastases at the time of brain metastasis diagnosis. Group 1 showed better OS, followed by group 2 and group 3, sequentially (p < 0.001). Univariate analyses showed that treatment with curative intent (surgery or SRS), Child-Pugh class A, alpha-fetoprotein level < 400 ng/ml, and recursive partitioning analysis classification I or II were associated with improved survival (p < 0.001, 0.002, 0.029, and 0.012, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that treatment with curative intent and Child-Pugh class A was associated with improved OS (p < 0.001 and 0.009, respectively).

We applied a Markov model to estimate and compare cost effectiveness for the two competing treatments of SBRT and RFA in management of unresectable isolated hepatic metastases. Method(s): We developed a multistate Markov decision model with probabilistic sensitivity analysis to simulate a randomized controlled trial for SBRT and RFA and compare respective cost effectiveness (in dollars per quality adjusted life years, or QALY). Model assumptions were based on extensive literature search of utilities and recurrence risks, including published data from our institution. Costs were taken from the 2013 Medicare reimbursement tables. In order to reflect reported patient selection variability across literature, two mortality rates due to hepatic metastases were considered for both treatment modalities: 50% probability of death in 1.5 years and 60% in 5 years. Sensitivity analysis was performed to model uncertainty in these parameters. Result(s): For patients with 5-year life expectancy, Markov cohort analysis demonstrated QALY-adjusted survival advantage of SBRT over RFA with QALY 4.35 vs. 3.89 respectively. This difference was marginal for patients with 1.5-year life expectancy. Physician-hour involvement was less in SBRT group. The incremental cost adjusted effectiveness (Cost/QALY) for SBRT over RFA was $2,379 in the 5-year life expectancy cohort, and $2,216 for SBRT over RFA in the 1.5-year cohort. Sensitivity analysis demonstated robustness of these results across a range of utility values, costs, recurrence rates, and procedure-related morbidity. Conclusion(s): In comparison to RFA, SBRT was more cost-effective modality for unresectable or potentially resectable hepatic metastases over a wide range of treatment and disease assumptions, including recurrence rates, and procedure-related morbidity. Additionally, SBRT is a relatively fast outpatient procedure requiring less physician-hour involvement.",exclusion,Wrong comparator,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using a Markov model and 1-month cycle over a lifetime horizon. Transition probabilities, quality of life utilities, and costs associated with SBRT and RFA were captured in the model on the basis of a comprehensive literature review and Medicare reimbursements in 2014. Strategies were compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, with effectiveness measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). To account for model uncertainty, 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Strategies were evaluated with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained. RESULTS: In base case analysis, treatment costs for 3 fractions of SBRT and 1 RFA procedure were $13,000 and $4397, respectively. Median survival was assumed the same for both strategies (25 months). The SBRT costs $8202 more than RFA while gaining 0.05 QALYs, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $164,660 per QALY gained. In 1-way sensitivity analyses, results were most sensitive to variation of median survival from both treatments. Stereotactic body radiation therapy was economically reasonable if better survival was presumed (>1 month gain) or if used for large tumors (>4 cm). CONCLUSIONS: If equal survival is assumed, SBRT is not cost-effective compared with RFA for inoperable colorectal liver metastases. However, if better local control leads to small survival gains with SBRT, this strategy becomes cost-effective. Ideally, these results should be confirmed with prospective comparative data.",exclusion,Wrong comparator,,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2016.02.045
random-journal.pdf,LivM69,NCT02791503,2016,,LIV.M:#2;LIV.P:#1,CROSSFIRE Trial: comparing the Efficacy of Irreversible Electroporation With Radiotherapy,"Pancreatic cancer has the highest mortality rate of all major cancers; 94% of pancreatic cancer patients will die within five years of diagnosis, 74% within the first year of diagnosis; only 6% will survive for more than five years. Surgical resection is the only curative option. However, about 40% present with non‐metastatic locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma (LAPC; AJCC stage III). These patients are not eligible for surgical resection because the tumor involves major blood vessels such as the superior mesenteric artery, celiac axis, common hepatic artery and/or portal vein. These patients are currently treated with palliative chemotherapy as first line therapy. Focal therapy using external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) may further improve survival, but outcome remains poor. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is a form of EBRT that has important advantages over conventional radiotherapy such as a more precise and greater biological dose delivery and hence less toxicity and presumably better outcome. For patients diagnosed with LAPC, a combination of chemotherapy plus local tumor destruction using irreversible electroporation (IRE), a novel tumor ablation technique, has recently shown great promise. IRE is based on permeabilization of the cell membrane through electrical pulses leading to apoptosis. Theoretically, IRE only affects viable tumor tissue, leaving surrounding vital structures relatively intact. It is therefore considered to cause less morbidity than thermal ablative strategies. The CROSSFIRE‐trial is a prospective, randomized controlled phase‐II/III trial.The primary aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of chemotherapy and IRE (experimental arm) to the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiation (control arm) in patients with locally advanced, non‐resectable, non‐metastasized, pancreatic cancer. In total, 138 patients with histologically proven locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (AJCC stage III), aged ≥ 18 years will be included. Patients with a specific cardiac history (arrhythmias, pacemaker), pre‐existent ECG‐abnormalities and/or non‐retrievable metallic self‐expanding biliary stents are excluded from participation.

Local control (LC) rates, toxicities, and factors of prognostic significance were also assessed.A total of 40 CRC patients with 57 liver and/or lung oligometastatic lesions were included. Most of the patients (95%) had received at least 1 line of previous systemic chemotherapy. Among them, 19 patients with 26 lesions received 3D-CRT with a median dose of 51.5 Gy in 16.1 fractions, 7 patients with 11 lesions received IMRT with a median dose of 49.3 Gy in 10.4 fractions, and 14 patients with 20 lesions received SBRT with a median dose of 56.4 Gy in 6.7 fractions, respectively. The median follow-up time was 34 months (range, 9-86 months). Median OS and PFS for patients were 30.0 months [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 21.3-38.7] and 11.0 months (95% CI, 9-13), respectively. One, 3, and 5 years' LC rates for metastasis were 63.2%, 24.6%, and 16.9%, respectively. In subgroup analysis, patients with metachronous metastases had longer OS (median, 41.0 months; 95% CI, 33.3-48.7) than patients with synchronous lesions (median, 17.0 months; 95% CI, 7.4-26.6, P = .001). All patients tolerated the radiation treatment well, and there was no treatment-related death. Multivariate analysis showed that number of metastasis lesions and simultaneous liver and lung metastases were potential survival predictors.The study demonstrated that curative radiotherapy might be a tolerable and potential alternative for the treatment of patients with liver and/or lung oligometastases from CRC, and patients with metachronous lesions might have better survival than those with synchronous lesions when treated with curative-intent radiotherapy.",exclusion,,,10.1097/MD.0000000000012601

In our institution, we reported high local control (3-year local control rate: 96%) and feasibility in prospective phase II study of SBRT for solitary HCC (4 cm) (Cancer 2016; 122: 2041-9). In addition, SBRT has specific characteristics; those are 1. Non-invasive therapy without pain or hemorrhage, 2. Easy to treat deep lesion in the body, 3.Little complication in relation with large vessel or biliary tract when treating those adjacent tumors, 4. Flexible dose strength based on the liver function and target volume. Because of those characteristics, we believe that SBRT plays an important role in the treatment for HCC, especially adjacent to or invading large vessel and just beneath diaphragm. Currently, in order to validate the efficacy and feasibility of SBRT for HCC, multicenter prospective study of SBRT for untreated solitary HCC (STRSPH study; UMIN000013011) is ongoing. Liver oligometastasis from colorectal cancer (OMCRC) is another disease that SBRT can play an important role. Although colorectal cancer is rather radio-resistant, we believe that SBRT can treat patients with OMCRC and result in good local control with feasibility. In fact, we reported excellent outcomes of SBRT for pulmonary and liver OMCRC with a total dose of 50-60 Gy in five fractions prescribed to the 60% isodose line of the maximum dose covering the surface of the planning target volume. The local control was 100% (J Radiat Res. 2016; 57: 400-5). Currently, in order to validate the efficacy and feasibility of SBRT for OMCRC, single institution prospective study of SBRT for OMCRC (UMIN000026577) is ongoing.

METHODS: Patients with HCC with extrahepatic metastasis or vascular or bile duct invasion were enrolled between May 2011 and June 2015. The Cyberknife was used to treat each lesion. Treatment response scores were based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1. The trends of tumor markers, including alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and proteins induced by vitamin K absence II (PIVKA II) were assessed. Prognostic factors for tumor response and tumor markers were evaluated with Fisher's exact test and a logistic regression model. Survival was evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients with 95 lesions were enrolled. Based on the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification, all patients were either in the advanced or terminal stage of the disease. The target lesions were as follows: 52 were bone metastasis; 9, lung metastasis; 7, brain metastasis; 9, portal vein invasion; 4, hepatic vein invasion; 4, bile duct invasion; and 10 other lesion types. The response rate and disease control rate were 34% and 53%, respectively. None of the clinical factors correlated significantly with tumor response. Fiducial marker implantation was associated with better control of both AFP (HR = 0.152; 95%CI: 0.026-0.887; P = 0.036) and PIVKA II (HR = 0.035; 95%CI: 0.003-0.342; P = 0.004). The median survival time was 9 mo (95%CI: 5-15 mo). Terminal stage disease (HR = 9.809; 95%CI: 2.589-37.17, P < 0.001) and an AFP of more than 400 ng/mL (HR = 2.548; 95%CI: 1.070-6.068, P = 0.035) were associated with worse survival. A radiation dose higher than 30 Gy (HR = 0.274; 95%CI: 0.093-0.7541, P = 0.012) was associated with better survival. In the 52 cases of bone metastasis, 36 patients (69%) achieved pain relief. One patient had cerebral bleeding and another patient had an esophageal ulcer after treatment. CONCLUSION: The Cyberknife can be safely administered to patients with advanced or terminal stage HCC. High AFP levels were associated with worse survival, but a higher radiation dose improved the survival.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.3748/wjg.v21.i46.13101

Online plan adaptation increases treatment times for patients and comprises an increased burden on technical and clinical staff. Although preliminary trial results are encouraging, it remains unclear if the dosimetric benefits of online‐adaptive planning studies will translate to measurable improvements in clinical outcomes that merit its routine use. In our preliminary study, plan adaptation was most often required when tumors were adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract (the esophagus to the sigmoid colon), as those structures were most commonly the dose‐limiting structures and were noted to change in location on a day‐to‐day basis. For these reasons, abdominal disease sites have historically highlighted the limitations of SBRT. Specifically, the investigators will enroll patients with oligometastatic or unresectable primary disease of the non‐liver abdomen to a randomized, prospective trial. Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms, in which they will receive either online‐adaptive, MRI‐guided SBRT or non‐adaptive MRI‐guided SBRT. Both patient groups will undergo MRI simulation and MRI treatment localization with online MR monitoring and/or gating. All patients will be treated in five fractions over one to two weeks. By adhering to strict normal tissue constraints, the investigators expect toxicity to be within the current standard of care for the non‐adaptive arm, with reduction in toxicity in the arm of patients who undergo adaptation based on daily anatomic changes.",exclusion,Wrong comparator,MRI‐guided SBRT vs non‐adaptive MRI‐guided SBRT,

However, appropriate survival prediction models are scarce. This study aimed to develop a simple and clinically useful prognostic nomogram for patients with nondistant metastatic Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C HCC undergoing SBRT. Method(s): The data were based on a prospective multi-institutional registry enrolling 246 patients with nondistant metastatic BCLC stage C HCC treated with SBRT between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2016. They were randomly divided into two subsets: 164 into the development cohort and 82 into the validation cohort. We identified and included prognostic factors for survival to derive a nomogram in the development cohort. The predictability of the nomogram was evaluated in the validation cohort. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the calibration plot were used to evaluate the performance of the nomogram. Result(s): The median survival was 13.5 months, with 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS) rates of 55.0 and 32.9%, respectively. Number of tumors, largest tumor size, macrovascular invasion, Child-Turcotte-Pugh class, and biologically effective dose were significantly associated with OS (p < 0.05). These predictors were included to develop a nomogram with an AUROC of 0.77 (0.73-0.87). The prediction model was well calibrated in the validation cohort. The OS for patients who were divided by their risk scores differed significantly (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): The nomogram we generated had discriminatory and satisfactory predictability for OS among nonmetastatic BCLC stage C HCC patients treated with SBRT. It demands further validations with cross-country data to confirm its worldwide usefulness.Copyright © 2020 © 2020 The Author(s) Published by S.

Early detection is crucial because complete surgical resection is the only curative treatment. It has been previously reported that an 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) image with a T/L (Tumor/Liver) SUV max ratio > 1.5 provides a high negative predictive value; however, it is not specific enough to make a NF1-related MPNST diagnosis. A formal proof of malignant transformation from a histological analysis is necessary before surgical excision because the procedure can cause mutilation. The objective of the present work was to investigate the effectiveness of and complications associated with PET/CT-guided percutaneous biopsies for an NF1-related MPNST diagnosis. METHODS: PET/CT-guided percutaneous biopsy procedures performed on 26 NF1 patients with a clinical suspicion of MPNST and a suspect lesion from a PET/CT scan (T/L SUV max ratio > 1.5) were retrospectively evaluated. The localization of the suspected malignant site was determined using PET/CT. A stereotactic (ultrasonic and CT control) core biopsy technique was used with a local anesthesia. RESULTS: The first PET/CT-guided percutaneous biopsies enabled a pathological diagnosis for all of the patients (no ""inconclusive "" results were obtained), and no secondary procedures were needed. Among the 26 patients, the histopathological results from the biopsy were malignant in 17 cases and benign (BPNST with atypical cells) in nine cases. No complications from the diagnostic procedure were observed. A surgical resection was performed in 18 patients (seven benign and 11 malignant biopsies), removing the fine needle biopsy scar. In addition, six locally advanced/metastatic MPNST were treated with chemo/radiotherapy, and two BPNST had no progression after a follow-up of 14 and 39 months, respectively. The PET/CT-guided percutaneous biopsy gave 25 accurate diagnoses and one false negative (BPNST with atypical cells on the biopsy and MPNST on the operated tumor), resulting in a diagnostic accuracy rate of 96%. This false negative case may be explained by the high heterogeneity of the tumor: benign areas were contiguous with the malignant ones and associated with inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: PET/CT-guided percutaneous biopsies are an effective and relatively non-traumatic procedure for diagnosis of NF1-related MPNST. It is the most reliable approach for early detection of MPNST.",exclusion,"Wrong patients, wrong intervention",,10.1371/journal.pone.0138386

The purpose of this study was to assess differences between RSI scores in primary colon cancer and metastases. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients were identified from our institutional review board-approved prospective observational protocol. A total of 704 metastatic and 1362 primary lesions were obtained from a de-identified metadata pool. RSI was calculated using the previously published rank-based algorithm. An independent cohort of 29 lung or liver colon metastases treated with 60 Gy in 5 fractions stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) was used for validation. RESULTS: The most common sites of metastases included liver (n=374; 53%), lung (n=116; 17%), and lymph nodes (n=40; 6%). Sixty percent of metastatic tumors, compared with 54% of primaries, were in the RSI radiation-resistant peak, suggesting metastatic tumors may be slightly more radiation resistant than primaries (P=.01). In contrast, when we analyzed metastases based on anatomical site, we uncovered large differences in RSI. The median RSIs for metastases in descending order of radiation resistance were ovary (0.48), abdomen (0.47), liver (0.43), brain (0.42), lung (0.32), and lymph nodes (0.31) (P<.0001). These findings were confirmed when the analysis was restricted to lesions from the same patient (n=139). In our independent cohort of treated lung and liver metastases, lung metastases had an improved local control rate compared to that in patients with liver metastases (2-year local control rate of 100% vs 73.0%, respectively; P=.026). CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of radiation sensitivity between primary and metastatic tissues of colon cancer histology revealed significant differences based on anatomical location of metastases.

Patients and Methods: MRI data of 26 PTVs in 22 radiation series of 19 patients with liver metastases of diverse primaries were analyzed retrospectively at 6-10 weeks after CyberKnife-SBRT. T1w pre- and post-contrast and T2w MRI images were intermodally matched to the planning CT and the corresponding dose distribution with a deformable image registration algorithm. Due to varying fractionation schedules, absolute doses were converted to EQD2alpha/beta=x with alpha/beta values of 2 and 3 Gy for healthy- and 8 Gy for modelled pre-damaged (cirrhotic or post-chemo) liver tissue. Result(s): Similar to previously published data in a patient population treated by gantry-based SBRT (Boda-Heggemann et al., 2016), characteristic sharply defined, non-blurred MRI morphologic alterations were observed outside the high-dose volume. Geometrically, these alterations were rather centroid in comparison to the gantry-based beam path-like changes as a consequence of a more isotropic dose distribution for robotic SBRT. In the T1w pre-contrast series, 8 datasets did not show any and 18 datasets demonstrated hypointense alterations. In T1w postcontrast, all alterations were hypointense and in the T2w sequences predominantly hyperintense (20 of 26). T1w pre-contrast hypointensity occurred at isodose lines of nominally 36.4 +/- 7.5 Gy (EQD2alpha/beta= 2 121.6 +/- 49.1 Gy, EQD2alpha/beta= 3 104.5 +/- 40.7 Gy, EQD2alpha/beta= 8 70.3 +/- 24.0 Gy). T1w post-contrast hypointensity was observed within isodose lines of nominally 32.7 +/- 7.3 Gy (EQD2alpha/beta= 2 103.1 +/- 44.0 Gy, EQD2alpha/beta= 3 89.2 +/- 36.9 Gy; EQD2alpha/beta= 8 61.2 +/- 21.8 Gy). T2w alterations were observed within isodose lines of nominally 35.7 +/- 9.2 Gy (EQD2alpha/beta= 2 119.5 +/- 56.7 Gy, EQD2alpha/beta= 3 102.7 +/- 47.1 Gy; EQD2alpha/beta= 8 69.4 +/- 27.8 Gy). Conclusion(s): Post-robotic SBRT changes in healthy liver tissue could be directly spatially correlated to respective isodose lines using intermodal deformable image registration. Outside the high-dose region, centroid alterations in T1w and T2w sequences could be observed. Nominal doses of 32-36 Gy (EQD2alpha/beta= 3 89-104 Gy) induce characteristic MRI morphologic alterations. These alterations appear at higher doses than in the previously published gantry-based SBRT cohort, particularly when EQD2 was calculated with low alpha/beta ratios. Various factors may contribute to this phenomenon among which are varying volume effects with different dose distribution and dose rate characteristics, higher alpha/beta ratios for normal liver tissue than currently presumed, as well as inaccuracies of current normal tissue toxicity models, all requiring further investigation.",exclusion,No comparator,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00066-017-1137-6

METHODS: The (a) and (b) arms investigated primary and metastatic lung cancer differentiated by site of onset, arm (c) included primary or metastatic lesions outside the thorax, the (d) and (e) arms were for in-field reirradiation of recurrence, and finally, the (f) and (g) arms were for boost irradiation to the lesions after an adjuvant RT prescribed dose. A 4 months cut-off after previous irradiation course was fixed to distinguish the boost from the retreatment (<4 vs >4 months, respectively). Patients were prospectively enrolled in study arms according to tumor site, clinical stage and previous treatment. The total dose prescribed to the isocenter, ranged from 20 to 50 Gy according to the protocol design and the doses per fraction ranged from 4 to 10 Gy in 5 days. RESULTS: A total of 281 patients (M/F: 167/114; median age: 69 years) with 376 lesions underwent SBRT. No acute toxicity was reported in 175 patients (62.3%) while 106 (37.7%) experienced only low-grade (G < 2) acute toxicity. Four patients (all previously irradiated in the same site) showed >Grade 2 toxicity within 6 months from SBRT.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 2002 and 2009, 81 evaluable patients with liver metastases were treated on 2 prospective studies assessing SBRT, with prescription doses based on the effective liver volume irradiated evaluated. Toxicity was defined as grade ≥2 classic or nonclassic radiation induced liver disease (RILD). Specific toxicity endpoints evaluated were worsening transaminases and albumin levels within 3 months of SBRT. RESULTS: Seventy percent of patients had colorectal carcinoma, 55% had extrahepatic disease, 1 patient had hepatitis B, and 54% had received prior chemotherapy. Baseline transaminases were elevated at Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Effects, V4.0, grade 1, 2, and 3 levels in 33 (41%), 2 (2%), and 0 (0%) patients. The mean prescription dose was 43 Gy (27.7-60 Gy) in 6 fractions. The mean liver (minus gross tumor volume) dose (MLD) was 16 Gy (3-25.6 Gy) in 6 fractions. No classic or nonclassical ≥grade 2 RILD was observed. Within 3 months of SBRT, 49 (61%) patients had worsening of grade of transaminase and 23 (28%) patients had a reduction in albumin, all transient (majority grade ≤2 toxicity) without subsequent clinical toxicity. Seventeen patients exceeded Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic MLD guidelines (≤20 Gy), 13 (76%) of whom had worsening of transaminase grade. On multivariate analysis, worsening of liver enzymes was more likely in patients with higher doses to the spared 700 mL of liver (P = .026), and reduction of albumin was more likely with higher effective liver volume (odds ratio, 1.53 [range, 1.08-2.16]) P = .016).

random-journal.pdf,LivM81,,2016,English,5 study;LIV.M:#5;LIV.P:#5,Dosimetric aspects and robustness in treatment plan optimisation of small tumours,"Stereotactic radiation of small brain targets provides high spatial resolution and accuracy for positioning of patient and radiation fields, almost on submillimeter ranges. This is not matched by equally sharp dose gradients, since finite source size, collimator design limitations and transport of electrons in the irradiated tissue all diffuses the dose. Not surprisingly, the dose prescriptions evolving for small brain tumors aimed for a specified dose to the target periphery, accepting whatever resulting dose to the target center. A kind of standard evolved aiming for a ratio of approximately 65% relative dose at the periphery versus the maximum target center dose (or 154% center-to-periphery ratio). This dose heterogeneity was considered favorable, as to more effectively treat presumably hypoxic cells at the tumor center. The stereotactic treatment methodology for brain treatments were in the early 1990s transferred to radiation of liver metastasis. Through use of stereotactic body frame high target positioning reproducibility was achieved, and similar dose prescriptions of heterogeneous dose were applied, with a center-to-periphery dose ratio of approximately 154%. Soon the technique was also applied to peripheral lung tumors. Following the development of 3D treatment planning systems in the late 1980s, ICRU responded to the need for consistent handling of geometrical uncertainties and launched in 1993 the ICRU 50 report recommending the use of GTV, CTV and PTV to capture the uncertainties. Specifically, the role of PTV was to ""ensure that the prescribed dose is actually absorbed in the CTV"". The normal use of the PTV is to plan a homogenous dose to its interior, through which it is assumed that the CTV gets the same dose as it is located in the PTV. This requires the dose inside the PTV to be both homogeneous and robust with respect to movements involving heterogeneities. The PTV concept was applied also for extracranial stereotactic body treatments, often inheriting a high center-to-periphery prescription. Dose calculations at the time used ""class a"" algorithms that not account for dose variations due to a varying level of lateral charged particle equilibrium caused by low density regions. Most so called pencil beam algorithms belong to this, class a, category. Accurate dose calculations can now be achieved with ""class b"" algorithms such as Monte Carlo, Collapsed Cone or Grid based Boltzmann equation solvers. However, for any algorithm that would calculate the dose physically correct, the resulting dose for the PTV is not representative for the CTV when the margin around the latter contains a lower density medium. Hence, the straight forward application of PTV based treated planning together with heterogeneous prescriptions principles (originally inherited from intracranial treatments), has created a confused situation with large uncertainties with respect to the actually delivered doses. A robust dosimetry can be achieved by realizing that the dose to a CTV surrounded by a low density medium will be independent of movements as long as it is exposed to a uniform fluence. Given that a near homogeneous fluence cover the PTV, dose prescriptions can then be done directly to the CTV based on a dose calculation with a ""class b"" algorithm (MC, CC or equivalent). As long as the movements of the CTV are kept well inside a PTV with a homogeneous fluence, the dose delivered to the CTV will be much closer to the prescribed dose, thus providing robust dose specification for small tumors. However, tools for optimization of uniform fluence are presently not provided in clinical TPS. Luckily, several workarounds exists that can ""cheat"" the optimization of homogenous dose to instead yield a effectively homogeneous fluence. From a pure physics point of view, this can be achieved by incapacitating the lateral spread of energy from the rays of the primary beam. In class a algorithms of the pencil beam kind, this can be implemented by changing the pencil beam parameter controlling the lateral spread. In point kernel algorithms such as CC, similar manipulation of kernel data can be done. In essence, in most algorithms fluence is a precursor for dose providing opportunities to access it. Alternatively, the density of the PTV can be set to a high value that shortens the electron transport distance enough to make the dose more fluence like. In summary, a robust small lung tumor dose can be implemented through a planning process in which the PTV is determined by the common practice addition of a setup margin to a MIP projections ITV, but replacing the common practice dose calculations by a fluence optimization followed by a class b dose calculation with the CC (or similar) algorithm, using absolute dose prescriptions to the CTV rather than the PTV. For a test series of 5 patients this procedure reduced the difference between prescribed and delivered dose to the CTV from 30% to 8% in D98, with a similar reduction for D02.",exclusion,No clinical study,,

Two patients' albumin decreased (CP score increase from A5 to A6) at 1 month, reversed at 3 months. Another developed a sustained decrease in albumin at 3 months. Liver enzyme toxicity up to 3 months post SBRT (Table 1) occurred in 43 patients (61%). There were no incidences of radiation induced liver disease. One patient had grade 3 ALP toxicity at 1 month that resolved at 3 months. On univariate analysis there was a trend to significance for dose to spared 700cc of liver and enzyme toxicity (P = 0.08). On multivariate analysis dose to spared 700cc was statistically significant (P = 0.025) and there was a trend to significance for prior liver surgery (P = 0.29) or BioNTCP (P = 0.21) and toxicity. No factors correlated with worsening of CP score. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that dose to 700cc of spared liver may be associated with acute liver enzyme abnormality. This dosimetric parameter has potential implications for future liver SBRT planning and ongoing clinical management.",exclusion,Wrong comparator,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2016.06.1098

Fortunately, with the development of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), treatment of lung cancer usher in a new era, resulting in a hit of precise therapy and molecule sequencing. However, it is inevitable for patients to gain acquired resistance of EGFR TKI. Several studies have been demonstrated that there were approximately 30% heterogeneous cells in primary tumors. And emerging studies illuminated that main pattern of treatment failure was the recurrence of primary site. Moreover, it was proved that despite of the drug‐resistance cells in progressive site, continual prescription of EGFR TKI in oligometastasis lung cancer could make a difference for patients in progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), owing to the residual responsive cells in another sites. Therefore, to explore an unique method to control heterogeneous cells in primary site so as to delay or prevent acquired resistance when taking EGFR TKI orally may be of great benefit and therapy. It is known to all that stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), with the advantage of hypofractionation and rapid release, succeed in several cancers, such as early lung cancer, prostatic, liver cancer and so on, for local control. Numerous reports explained SBRT played an irreplaceable role in progressive NSCLC patients after oral targeted medicine, regardless of EGFR or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutation. And the radiosensitivity of EGFR TKI in vitro and vivo may account for these inspiring results. What's more, it has reported that SBRT could induce inflammatory cell death, activate dendritic cell as well as accelerate antigen presentation in the draining lymph node, leading to antigen‐specific adaptive immune response. Nevertheless, although the potential effects of SBRT on advanced NSCLC are obviously, few studies explore the preventive benefits of early SBRT combined with oral EGFR TKI on advanced lung cancer by eliminating the heterogeneous cells in primary site. In addition, the investigators' previous phase II study of SBRT combined with oral EGFR TKI had revealed its safety and potentially improvement of PFS for 6 months. In this trial, the investigators put sight into assessing the efficacy of early application of SBRT to primary site in the advanced NSCLC patients and provide a hypothesis that early SBRT could strengthen the anti‐tumor effect of EGFR TKI through eradicating the heterogenity of initial tumor cells.",exclusion,Other study,,

In addition, to describe the patients' and treatment characteristics, and to provide a temporal analysis. METHOD: SBRT patients treated from 2007 to 2015 were retrospectively evaluated by two independently investigators. Data were stratified and compared in two periods: first experience (FE) (May 2007 to April 2011), and following experience (FollowE) (May 2011 to April 2015). The following parameters were compared between the groups: total number of treated patients and lesions, treatment site, additional image fusion used, formal protocol adoption, and SBRT planning technique. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-six (176) patients with 191 lesions were treated: 34 (18%) lesions in the FE and 157 (82%) lesions in FollowE. The majority of lesions were metastases (60.3%), and lung (60.2%) was the most common treatment site, followed by spine (31%), and others (8.8%). An average of 1.4 (±0.6) additional imaging exams for delineation was performed. Conformal 3D radiotherapy planning technique was used in 64.4%, and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in the remaining 35.6% (p=0.0001). Higher rates of curative treatments were observed in FE, as well as more lung lesions, patients ≥ 70 years, 3D conformal, number of additional images and ECOG 0, and all presented p<0.05.

METHODS: 200 patients were included in this retrospective study. They were treated from March 1999 to December 2010 with preoperative stereotactic gamma knife radiosurgery followed by endoresection and adjuvant brachytherapy in most cases. RESULTS: A total of 200 patients were included in this study (113 male, 87 female). Mean tumour height was 9.4 mm and the largest basal diameter ranged from 6.3 to 20 mm. The median follow-up time was 32.3 months. In 13.4% the eye was retained with a VA of 20/50 or better, in 33.6% VA was ranging from 20/400 to 20/50 and 53% had a VA of less than 20/400. In almost 90% of the cases the eye was preserved at the final visit. In 15.5% additional major surgery was required. In terms of survival 15.5% of our patients developed liver metastases during follow-up and died. Local tumour recurrence was observed in 10 out of 200 patients (5%) and was mainly treated with enucleation. The use of an adjuvant ruthenium-106 plaque did not lower the recurrence or enucleation rate significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Eyes with a large uveal melanoma can be preserved by stereotactic radiotherapy followed by endoresection with the chance to obtain useful vision in approximately half of the cases.

It has been suggested that radiation (RT) and combination IO may work synergistically to increase the immune system's exposure to tumor antigens, potentiating an abscopal effect. However, the impact of combination IO to stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) on local control of irradiated lesions has not been elucidated. Materials/Methods: In this study, we combined two prospective phase II single arm studies to compare the impact of SBRT alone (NCT01239381) or with PD-L1/CTLA4 blockade (NCT03104439) on the growth of colorectal and pancreatic liver and lung metastases. Eligible patients had metastatic colorectal or pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Those treated on NCT01239381 received liver SBRT alone (30-50 Gy in 5 fractions), while those on NCT03104439 received combination IO 6 weeks prior to and concurrently with 24 Gy in 3 fractions to liver or lung metastases. Tumor genotyping was performed to assess for KRAS and TP53 mutations. Target lesions were measured on CT scans prior to and following RT. Peak response was measured via modified RECIST criteria as the largest tumor reduction at any time. Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were performed to evaluate % tumor reduction with regards to combination IO, primary tumor site, metastasis site, and KRAS and TP53 mutation status. Result(s): There were 50 eligible patients from NCT01239381 and 41 from NCT03104439, of whom 42 and 39 were evaluable, respectively. Of these 81 patients, 52 and 29 had colorectal and pancreatic cancer, respectively. Of those with molecular analysis, 50% (33/66) had a KRAS mutation and 55% (34/61) had a TP53 mutation. Median follow up was 78 days in the IO arm (driven by distant progression) and 160 days in the non-IO arm (P<0.0001). Mean BED in the IO arm was 43.2 Gy vs. 79.6 Gy in the SBRT alone arm (P<0.0001). Mean target size was 3.8 cm in the IO arm, and 5.0 cm in the SBRT alone arm (P=0.12). There was no difference with respect to overall response rate (38.5% vs. 52.4%, P=0.27) and disease control rate (92.3% vs. 92.9%, P>0.99). There was no significant difference in the % tumor reduction between the IO and non-IO arms (-21% vs. -41%, P=0.08). Among the entire cohort, there was no significant difference in response of irradiated lesion with respect to primary tumor type (P= 0.54), KRAS status (P=.67), TP53 status (P=0.10), or metastatic site (P=0.58). Conclusion(s): Despite receiving approximately half the BED dose compared to liver SBRT alone, patients treated with IO and RT had similar response rates, suggesting a potential synergistic effect in the irradiated lesions. Future studies should look to validate these findings and explore optimal RT dose/fractionation schemas in combination with IO.

random-journal.pdf,LivM88,,2015,English,5 study;LIV.M:#5;LIV.P:#1,Evolving role of radiation for oligometastases,"The key objectives of this presentation are to review the fundamental biology underlying metastatic disease, understand the definition and clinical evidence for oligo- (or limited) metastatic disease, analyze key clinical trials showing the potential role of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for oligometastases and address challenges regarding this ""high-tech"" strategy. In the early 1900s, Halsted suggested that breast cancer spread via the local regional lymphatic vessels in a stepwise manner. Thus, once there are metastases, local therapy had no clear role. Later in the 20th century, an opposing theory (the ""Fisher"" theory) suggested that cancer is a systemic disease that, if it will ever metastasize, will already have done so early in the disease course. Local therapies are therefore less important than systemic therapies. A counterpoint to these approaches was proposed by Hellman and Weichselbaum, postulating that cancer is a spectrum from localized to wide-spread disease at the time of diagnosis, with many intermediate states (Hellman S, Weichselbaum RR. Oligometastases. J Clin Oncol. 1995 Jan;13(1):8-10). ""Oligometastases"" are essentially early metastases which are limited in number and location and based on a state of limited metastatic capacity. The hypothesis based on this approach is that there may be a subset of patients with oligometastatic disease for whom aggressive local treatment (such as surgery or SBRT) could change their outcome. Clinical evidence for oligometastasis includes the surgical experience for lung or liver metastases showing long-term survivals of approximately 20%. Studies are now emerging suggesting similar results utilizing SBRT. In an individual patient data metaanalysis of outcomes after surgery or SBRT, Ashworth et al. reported a 5-year survival rate of approximately 30% in patients with oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer (Ashworth AB, et al. An individual patient data metaanalysis of outcomes and prognostic factors after treatment of oligometastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. Clin Lung Cancer. 2014 Sep;15(5):346-55). They developed a risk classification schema showing a better prognosis for metachronous vs. synchronous oligometastases (of which node-negative was favorable to node-positive). Other studies have shown that, among patients treated with SBRT for 1-5 oligometastases, those with <=3 metastases had better outcomes compared to those with 4-5 metastases. The size of the metastases also appears to be important, as well as the biological equivalent dose (BED) of the SBRT. Studies have begun to explore the role of SBRT for oligometastases involving the lung, liver, adrenal, and other sites. It is likely that host-related factors (for example, immune mediated anticancer activity) and tumor related factors (such as genomics and proteomics) also affect the spectrum of disease aggressiveness. Challenges to this new ""high-tech"" approach will also be addressed, including issues related to patient selection, the level of evidence, and the cost effectiveness of this approach. Other approaches for improving the outcome for patients with metastatic disease will also be discussed, including the role of early palliative interventions. In summary, emerging (albeit non-randomized) data suggests that SBRT appears to be a promising strategy in selected patients with oligometastases. The patients most likely to benefit from SBRT have metachronous (vs. synchronous) metastases, N0 (vs. N+) disease, 1-3 metastases (vs. more), small metastases, and the ability to receive a higher radiation dose (BED >100Gy). Randomized trials are needed to establish whether SBRT improves progression free and/or over survival in this setting.",exclusion,Narrative review,"Important, read for more information",

However, extreme caution should be exercised in treating tumors closely located to organs at risk (OARs) with SABR. To reduce complications, we have applied split-course SABR to oligometastases closely located to OARs or to those being retreated with radiotherapy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with oligometastases who were treated with planned split-course SABR between January 2012 and December 2016. RESULTS: A total of 23 patients with 29 oligometastatic lesions were enrolled. The primary diagnoses were bone and soft tissue cancers in 13 lesions, liver cancers in 12 lesions, and colorectal cancers in four lesions. The median tumor volume was 78 cm3 (range, 4-1781 cm3). The lesions were treated with 1-3 fractions in the first stage of SABR (first SABR), and one or two fractions in the second stage of SABR (second SABR). The time interval between the two stages was about 4 weeks. A partial response was noted in 16 lesions (55%) after the first SABR, and practical reductions in the doses to OARs were observed in the second SABR compared with the first SABR. The 1-, 2- and 3-year local control rates were 92%, 65% and 43%, respectively. No Grade 4 or 5 toxicities were observed during or after treatment.

Treatment of tumors located close to the diaphragm in the hepatic dome is challenging for percutaneous radiofrequency (RF) ablation for these reasons. The purpose was to assess the feasibility, safety, and clinical outcome of multi-probe stereotactic RF ablation (SRFA) of liver tumors in the subdiaphragmatic area. Method(s): Between 2006 and 2018, 177 patients (82 HCCs, 6 ICCs, and 89 metastatic tumors) underwent SRFA of 238 tumors abutting the diaphragm in the hepatic dome. For comparison, 177 patients were randomly selected from our database by the R package ""MatchIt"" for propensity score matching to compare treatment safety and efficacy in this retrospective, single-center study. Result(s): Median treated tumor size was 2.2 cm (range 0.5 to 10 cm). SRFA was primarily successful for 232/238 (97.5%) tumors. Five tumors were successfully retreated, resulting in a secondary technical efficacy rate of 99.6%. Local tumor recurrence developed in 21 of 238 tumors (8.8%).

NBTXR efficacy was demonstrated in a phase II/III study in soft tissue sarcoma (NCT075) and is currently evaluated in other solid tumors including liver cancers. The use of this radio enhancer is particularly relevant in liver cancer management, a difficult to treat heterogenous population, due to the presence of underlying liver dysfunction. Method(s): Phase I/II study of NBTXR activated by RT in patients (pts) with HCC (with/without portal vein tumor thrombus) or liver metastasis (mets) NCT071056.

We investigated the preliminary outcome of efficacy and toxicity associated with frameless fractionated gamma knife radiosurgery (FF GKRS) for the treatment of large metastatic brain tumors. METHODS: Fifteen patients with 17 lesions were treated using FF GKRS and included in this study, because of the large tumor size of more than 10 cm(3). FF GKRS was performed based on a thermoplastic mask system for 3 to 5 consecutive days. RESULTS: The mean duration of clinical follow-up was 12 months (range, 4-24), and the local control rate was 100%. Tumor volume decreased in 13 lesions (76.5%), and remained stable in 4 lesions (23.5%).

We report on gallbladder toxicity and attribution to treatment in a prospective series of patients with primary and metastatic liver tumors receiving ablative-intent HFXRT and SBRT with protons. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We evaluated 93 patients with intact gallbladders enrolled in either of 2 trials investigating proton HFXRT and SBRT for primary and metastatic liver tumors from 2009 to 2014. Patients received 45 to 67.5 GyE in 15 fractions for primary liver tumors (n = 45) and 30 to 50 GyE in 5 fractions for metastatic tumors (n = 48). No gallbladder dose constraints were used at treatment, and gallbladder volumes and dose-volume histograms were created retrospectively. Attributable toxicity was defined as cholecystitis or perforation without preexisting gallbladder disease. Baseline factors were evaluated using Fisher exact test and the nonparametric K-sample test. RESULTS: At baseline, 25 patients had preexisting cholelithiasis and 15 underwent biliary stenting before or after RT. Median follow-up after treatment was 11.8 months (range, 0.1-59.2 months). Despite maximum gallbladder doses >70 GyE in 41%, >80 GyE in 31%, and >90 GyE in 13% (equieffective dose at 2 Gy [EQD2], α/β = 3), there were no attributable cases of gallbladder toxicity. Two patients developed grade 3 and 4 cholecystitis 16 and 2 months after treatment, respectively, and both had a strong history of preexisting cholelithiasis and biliary stenting. These patients received relatively low gallbladder doses with mean doses of 0.02 GyE and 5.1 GyE (EQD2, α/β = 3), well below the 17.1 GyE mean for the remaining cohort (range, 0-81.1 GyE, EQD2). CONCLUSIONS: We identified no relationship between gallbladder dose and toxicity and did not reach the maximum tolerated gallbladder dose in this cohort treated with high-dose radiation. We recommend not constraining dose to the gross tumor volume to protect the gallbladder during ablative HFXRT and SBRT.",inclusion,Not correct follow-up,HFXRT could be a comparator??,10.1016/j.prro.2017.02.001

The study presents the geometric and dosimetric improvements in treatment accuracy of the gating compared to standard CBCT-guided non-gated treatment. Material and Methods Thirteen patients with primary liver cancer or metastases had three electromagnetic transponders (Calypso) implanted near the target and received three-fraction gated liver SBRT at a TrueBeam Linac. The PTV was created by a 5mm axial and 7mm (n=10) or 10mm (n=3) cranio-caudal (CC) expansion of the CTV as defined on an exhale breath-hold CT. A mean homogenous dose between 45 and 61.8Gy was prescribed to the CTV using 7-field IMRT or 3D conformal planning. The PTV was covered with 67% of the prescribed dose. Treatment was delivered in free-breathing but gated to the exhale breathing phase according to the continuously monitored (25Hz) transponder centroid position. Gate ON windows were set to +/- 3mm LR/AP and +/-4 mm CC around the exhale position of the transponders. The couch was adjusted remotely if baseline drifts above ~1mm of the exhale transponder position occurred. Post-treatment, log files of the transponder motion and treatment delivery were used to calculate the motion-induced geometrical errors during beam-on in the actual gated treatments and in simulated non-gated standard treatments with CBCT-guided setup to the mean transponder centroid position before each fraction. The observed motion was used to reconstruct the actually delivered CTV dose distribution with gating and the would-be dose distribution without gating. Results Fig. 1 shows the internal tumor motion during a single fraction. Due to drift and respiratory motion the mean (+/- SD) geometric error during non-gated treatment at this fraction (Fig1A) would have been 1.3mm (1.7) LR, 5.0mm (7.7) CC, and -2.0mm (1.8) AP. The gated treatment, including 5 couch shifts to counteract drift (Fig1B), reduced the errors to 0.7mm (0.7) LR, 0.4mm (1.9) CC, and -0.1mm (0.9) AP. Fig. 1C shows the CC geometrical errors for all patients. The mean (range) number of couch corrections for drifts during each gated fraction was 2.8 (0-7). The mean duty cycle during gated treatment was 60.8% (31.7-72.7%). As shown in Fig 2A, gating markedly reduced the population based PTV margin needed for intrafraction motion. Motion-including dosereconstruction provided the CTV-DVHs of all fractions of planned, actual gated delivered, and simulated non-gated delivered doses. Mean CTV-DVHs are shown in Fig 2B. Note the large DVH variation for non-gated treatments. The mean (range) reduction in CTV D95 relative to the planned dose was 0.9 percent points (0.1-2.3) with gating and 6.8 percent points (0.9-29.6) without gating. Conclusion Gating based on internal motion monitoring markedly reduced geometric and dosimetric errors in liver SBRT compared to non-gated standard treatment. Results of the full trial (15 patients) are expected for presentation at ESTRO. (Figure Presented).",exclusion,No comparator,,

Indeed, most pts do not respond to initial therapy due to intrinsic resistance to checkpoint inhibition. There is thus an important unmet medical need for a curative treatment in these pts and converting the local immune microenvironment to a ""hot"" phenotype may help to overcome therapeutic resistance. Hafnium oxide nanoparticles (NBTXR3) activated by radiotherapy (RT) increase radiation dose deposit within cancer cells compared to RT alone. Recently, a phase II/III randomized trial of NBTXR3 in locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS) met primary and main secondary endpoints with significant superiority compared to RT alone. Furthermore NBTXR3+RT demonstrated an immunogenic cell deathmediated abscopal effect in a preclinical setting, and immune cell infiltration was observed in some tumors from STS pts treated with NBTXR3+RT but not in tumors from pts treated with RT alone. NBTXR3 is currently being evaluated in 7 clinical trials, including a phase I/II study in elderly frail patients with locally advanced HNSCC. To date, no early dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) have been observed. Method(s): Overall, these results have led us to evaluate NBTXR3 activated by stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) in combination with an approved antiPD1 antibody in an open label phase I/II, nonrandomized clinical trial in pts with more advanced diseases: Locoregionally recurrent or metastatic HNSCC, metastatic NSCLC, and liver metastasis pts. The phase I primary objectives are to determine NBTXR3 maximum tolerated dose(s), incidence of early DLTs and recommended dose(s). The phase II primary objectives are Complete Response Rate of target lesions and Objective Response Rate for the locoregional recurrent and the metastatic group respectively by RECIST 1.1, and safety/tolerability of treatment at the recommended dose(s).

Reduction of healthy tissue irradiation while at the same time increasing energy dose deposit within tumor cells still constitutes a challenge in radiation oncology. NBTXR3, hafnium oxide nanoparticles, increase energy deposit inside tumor cells only when activated by ionizing radiation such as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and thus increase tumor cell death compared to radiation alone. Patients (pts) with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or liver metastasis (mets) may benefit from the physical mode of action of NBTXR3, which does not engage liver and renal functions. A phase I/II clinical trial was conducted to evaluate NBTXR3 activated by SBRT in these pts [NCT02721056]. Materials/Methods: The Phase I part follows a 3+3 dose escalation design with dose levels of NBTXR3 corresponding to 10, 15, 22, and 33% of the baseline tumor volume. Pts were treated with a single NBTXR3 intralesional injection (ILI) followed by SBRT (45 Gy / 3 fractions / 5 to 7 days). Primary endpoints included identification of the recommended phase II dose(s) and early DLTs. Secondary endpoints included assessment of global safety profile, liver function evaluated by Child-Pugh score (CPS), AST to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), and response rate (mRECIST/RECIST 1.1). Result(s): Four levels of the dose escalation part are finalized (n=17): 6 pts at 10% (2 SBRT doses tested due to organs constraints), 4 pts at 15 and 22% (due to fiducial displacement and ILI shift) and 3 pts at 33%. No NBTXR3 related early DLT or SAE were observed. Indeed only one NBTXR3 related AE (G1 fatigue at 33%) was reported. There were no significant changes in CPS or APRI post-treatment. CT-scan assessment demonstrated absence of NBTXR3 leakage in surrounding tissues. Among 7 evaluable HCC pts, best mRECIST target lesion responses were: 3 CR, 4 PR. Among 5 evaluable mets pts, best target lesion responses were: 2 PR, 1 SD, 2 PD. Conclusion(s): NBTXR3 was well tolerated up to the 33% dose level and demonstrated a very good safety profile. The very good tolerance and preliminary anti-tumor effects have supported a protocol amendment to study an additional higher NBTXR3 dose level (42%). Indeed recent data reinforces this further escalation as OS and local control seem to depend on RT dose and tumor volume. Liver dysfunction is the limiting factor for treatment in these pts, hence, this innovative physics based approach may constitute a valuable solution for pts with unresectable liver tumors. NBTXR3 showed statistically superior efficacy over RT alone in a phase II/III trial in soft tissue sarcoma [NCT02379845] and is currently being evaluated in phase I/II trials: head and neck [NCT01946867; NCT02901483], prostate [NCT02805894] and rectal cancers [NCT02465593].Copyright © 2019",exclusion,Other study design,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.06.605

NBTXR3 is characterized by a single intratumor/intralesional (IL) administration and fits into standard RT schedule with no change in patient's flow, treatment protocol or equipment. Herein the preliminary results of a phase I/II clinical trial evaluating this combination in patients (pts) with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or liver metastasis (mets). Method(s): HCC and liver mets patients were treated with an IL injection of NBTXR3 followed by SBRT (15 Gy*3 fractions). The phase I part of the trial follows a 3+3 dose escalation design at dose levels of NBTXR3 corresponding to 10%, 15%, 22%, 33% of the baseline tumor volume. This study aims primarily to identify the Recommended Dose and the incidence of early Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) of NBTXR3 activated by SBRT. Secondary endpoints include assessment of global safety profile, liver function evaluated by Child-Pugh score (CPS), AST to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), and response rate (mRECIST/RECIST 1.1). Result(s): Enrollment is at the last dose level, 33%, and completed at 10% (6 pts), 15% (4 pts) and 22% (4 pts). So far, no early DLTs nor severe adverse events related to NBTXR3 were observed. Both CPS and APRI did not reveal important variations in accordance to NBTXR3 low toxicity. The best observed target lesions responses, among 7 evaluable HCC pts for response (mRECIST), were: 3 complete responses, 3 partial responses (PR) and 1 stable disease (SD) and among 5 evaluable liver mets pts: 1 PR, 3 SD and 1 progressive disease (RECIST 1.1). Conclusion(s): NBTXR3 is well tolerated at the 22% dose level with an overall positive safety profile. This innovative approach might constitute a valuable solution for pts with liver tumors beyond standard treatment lines.

Materials/Methods: As part of an IRB approved phase 2 trial of adaptive liver SBRT, patients were initially treated with 3 fractions of liver SBRT and reassessed 1 month later. An additional 2 fractions of SBRT were administered per protocol guidelines based on changes in indocyanine green clearance. Blood samples were collected at baseline and 1 month after the initial 3-fraction course of SBRT. Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) scores were prospectively acquired for each patient at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months after completing treatment. A 2 point increase in CTP score was considered a clinically significant change. Serum cytokine levels were analyzed using a bead-based multiplex assay. Fourteen cytokines were selected based on their potential role in liver disease. Forty-five of the 90 patients on the study were selected for the initial screen, including all of the patients who had a change in CTP score. Logistic regression models were used to determine the probability of a 2 point change in CTP score as a function of serum cytokine concentration. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated with confidence intervals. Result(s): Baseline CTP scores were 5 or 6 in 34 patients, 7 or 8 in 10 patients, and 9 in 1 patient; 39 patients had hepatocellular carcinoma, 2 had cholangiocarcinoma, and 4 had liver metastases. Eleven patients experienced a CTP score increase of 2 points or more within 6 months of starting liver SBRT. Interestingly, the treatment planning normal tissue complication probability for all of these patients was <1%. We found that high-serum levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) 1 month after 3 of the 5 planned fractions of liver SBRT, was associated with an increased risk of subsequently developing liver toxicity with an ROC AUC value of 0.83 (CI 0.70 to 0.97, P = .003). Additionally, low-serum CD40 ligand obtained 1 month after 3 fractions of SBRT was associated with an increased risk of developing liver toxicity with an ROC AUC value of 0.85 (CI 0.69 to 1.00, P = .007). Conclusion(s): Serum levels of HGF and CD40L may be early biomarkers of radiation induced liver toxicity from SBRT. High-serum HGF has previously been shown to be elevated in patients with acute and chronic liver disease. The low levels of serum CD40L seen in our study may be related to liver sequestration of activated T cells targeting the epithelium. These findings need to be validated in a larger patient cohort but could aid in personalized adaptive radiation therapy.",exclusion,Other study design,,
random-journal.pdf,LivM101,"Komaki-Cox, R",2019,English,#5;LIV.M:#1,IBS23.01 Radiotherapy of OMD in Daily Clinical Practice,"Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer related death in the world.1 Analysis of patterns of failure after first-line systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC suggest that most progression events, either within or outside the central nervous system (CNS), occur only at sites of disease known to exist at baseline, rather than in new sites.2 Once systemic treatment becomes more efficacious, for patients with limited numbers of metastases, ablation of those metastases may be advantageous in terms of cytoreduction or removal of dominant disease sites that may seed other sites in the future. Stage IV disease that is limited to only a small number of sites (""oligometastatic"" disease (OMD)) may reflect a more indolent phenotype that could benefit from local ablative therapy (e.g. surgery or radiation) for consolidation, as suggested by some preclinical and translational analyses.3,4 Several retrospective and small prospective trials have suggested that local therapy may be beneficial for patients with stage IV NSCLC presenting with limited metastases.5-8 At MDACC, we have performed a randomized, phase II study (NCT01725165) to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) after aggressive local consolidative therapy (LCT) versus maintenance therapy or observation for patients with stage IV NSCLC with <=3 metastases remaining after front line systemic therapy. As secondary aims, we explored: (1) the safety and incidence of high-grade toxicity, (2) overall survival (OS), (3) patterns of failure and the effect of salvage therapy among patients who crossed over to the local consolidation group, (4) time to development of disease at new metastatic sites, and (5) predictors of PFS. Findings of our randomized trial of aggressive LCT followed by standard maintenance therapy versus maintenance therapy alone for patients with oligometastatic NSCLC that did not progress after initial systemic therapy were as follows.10 We found that the PFS time for the standard (maintenance therapy) group was almost exactly as had been hypothesized from prior studies (3.9 months observed vs. 4 months hypothesized), whereas that of the experimental (LCT) group was substantially longer than predicted (11.9 months observed vs. 7 months hypothesized). Notably, our hypothesis was based on retrospective data in which sites of new disease versus sites of known disease could be followed more thoroughly for progression. In addition, time to the appearance of a new lesion was longer for patients in the LCT arm than for in the no-LCT arm (11.9 months vs. 5.7 months, p=0.0497), suggesting that the LCT could be altering the natural history of the disease2, either by limiting the potential for later spread or possibly by altering systemic anticancer immune responses to facilitate longer control of subclinical disease. Our trial used SBRT or surgery for local treatment for the oligometastasis. However more recent trial was done by consolidative radiotherapy for the limited oligometastatic NSCLC showing SBRT(SABR) Prior to the maintenance chemotherapy improved PFG compared to maintenance chemotherapy alone.10 Common oligometastatic lesions we usually treat by radiotherapy are brain, bone, adrenal gland, lung, liver lymph node, mediastinum, pleura and muscle. Daily clinical practice, we need to use image guided radiotherapy with 4 D simulation. We should use SBRT or SABR to eliminate oligometasis without overlapping previously irradiated area and avoid critical organs. Take home message: 1) We have enough evidence that treating oligometastasis by aggressive local treatment improved PFS and less appearance of new lesions. 2) Patients are able to tolerate local aggressive RT by SBRT (SABR). 3) Need to consider patients with oligometastases to be treated agressibly by SBRT (SABR). 4) Efficacy to improve OS by additional immunotherapy to the SBRT or SABR to the oligometastasis requires a prospective randomized studies in future.

The detection of these mutations is useful to guide treatment decisions, but tumors are not always easily accessible to re-biopsy. We report the case of a patient with ALK-rearranged NSCLC who presented acquired resistance to crizotinib and then alectinib. Sequencing analyses of DNA from a liver metastasis biopsy sample and circulating tumor DNA both found the same I1171N ALK kinase domain mutation, known to confer resistance to certain ALK inhibitors. However, the patient then received ceritinib, a 2nd generation ALK inhibitor, and achieved another partial response.

Outcome and toxicity were evaluated retrospectively in this single-institution patient cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2010 and 2014, 39 lesions were irradiated in 33 consecutive patients (18 male, 15 female, median age of 68 years). All the lesions were liver metastases (n = 34) or primary hepatocellular carcinomas (n = 5). The patients had undergone four-dimensional respiration-correlated PET-CT for treatment simulation to capture tumor motion. We analyzed local control with a focus on CT-based response at three months, one year and two years after treatment, looking at overall survival and the progression pattern. RESULTS: All patients were treated with hypofractionated image-guided stereotactic radiotherapy. The equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions varied from 62.5 Gy to 150 Gy, delivered in 3-10 fractions (median dose 93.8 Gy, alpha/beta = 10). The CT-based regression pattern three months after radiotherapy revealed partial regression in 72.7% of patients with a complete remission in 27.3% of the cases. The site of first progression was predominantly distant. One- and two-year overall survival rates were 85.4% and 68.8%, respectively. No toxicity of grade 2 or higher according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 was observed. CONCLUSION: SABR is a safe and efficient treatment for selected inoperable patients or irresectable tumors of the liver. Future studies should combine SABR with systemic treatment acting in synergy with radiation, such as immunological interventions or hypoxic cell radiosensitizers to prevent distant relapse.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.1016/j.ejso.2014.10.053
random-journal.pdf,LivM104,,2015,English,LIV.M:#5,Imaging tumour response-challenges,"RECIST criteria use changes in tumour diameters to quantitatively obtain response assessments for traditional chemotherapeutic cancer treatments: Positive responses are identified by reductions in tumour size while tumour growth signifies non-response. Traditional chemotherapies work primarily by damaging cells that are undergoing rapid growth and division. Immunotherapies work by stimulating the immune system to reject and destroy tumour cells. Targeted cancer therapies block the growth of cancer cells by interfering with specific molecules needed for tumour growth and carcinogenesis. These oncological treatments as well as stereotactic radiation therapy and local treatments, such as image-guided ablations and transarterial chemo embolization (TACE) can be used alone or in combination. Local treatment, radiation therapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy can each result in an increased tumour diameter in spite of treatment response at the cellular level and increased survival times. As a result, tumour diameter can no longer stand alone when assessing oncological treatment strategies. Tumour heterogeneity and contrast enhancement often change during treatment, and tumour enhancement combined with tumour size has been shown to be successful in assessing treatment response in gastrointestinal stromal tumours (CHOI criteria). Modified CHOI criteria could potentially be used for monitoring the effect of oncological treatment strategies in metastatic renal cell cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging (DCE-US, DCE-MRI and DCE-CT) uses changes in tumour enhancement following the intravenous injection of a contrast media to create a time-versus-signal curve. From such curves, reliable quantitative estimates of blood flow, blood volume and permeability can be obtained. Diffusion-weighted MRI and PET can also be used to obtain quantitative measures of physiological processes. A major advantage of DWI-MRI and PET is the possibility of whole body coverage, while DCE imaging is limited to a single tumour or a comparatively small region. Although quantitative assessments of oncological treatment response using physiological parameters have been shown to be superior to sizebased response in several studies, the methods mentioned are not yet standardized, and randomized multicentre studies have not yet been performed. When planning such studies, it is important to note that clinical endpoints such as progression free survival and overall survival are superior to morphological imaging results. In the routine assessment of oncological treatment responses, it is becoming increasingly important for the radiologists to know exactly what kind(s) of treatment that the patient has received. Simply reporting changes in tumour size using RECIST is no longer sufficient considering the large percentage of patients who receive advanced and often combined treatment regimens.",exclusion,Wrong intervention,,

We designed an individualized adaptive trial testing the hypothesis that adapting treatment based on change in liver function could optimize the therapeutic index for each patient. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the safety and efficacy of individualized adaptive stereotactic body radiotherapy (SRBT) for liver tumors in patients who have preexisting liver dysfunction. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From 2010 to 2014, 90 patients with intrahepatic cancer treated with prior liver-directed therapy were enrolled in this large phase 2, single-arm, clinical trial at an academic medical center. All patients had at least 1 year of potential follow-up. INTERVENTIONS: Using indocyanine green retention at 15 minutes (ICGR15) as a direct biomarker of liver function and a Bayesian adaptive model, planned SBRT was individually modified midway through the course of therapy to maintain liver function after the complete course. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was local control; the secondary outcome was safety and overall survival. RESULTS: Patients were 34 to 85 years of age, and 70% (63) were male. Ninety patients (69 [77%] with hepatocellular carcinoma, 4 [4%] with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and 17 [19%] with metastatic) received treatment to 116 tumors. Sixty-two patients (69%) had cirrhosis, 21 (23%) were Child-Pugh (CP) grade B. The median tumor size was 3 cm; 16 patients (18%) had portal vein involvement. Sixty-two (69%) received all 5 fractions (47 full dose, 15 dose-reduced owing to rising ICGR15). Treatment was well tolerated, with a lower than expected complication rate without adaptation: 6 (7%) experienced a 2-point decline in CP 6 months post-SBRT. The 1- and 2-year local control rates were 99% (95% CI, 97%-100%) and 95% (95% CI, 91%-99%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We demonstrated that the treatment strategy of individualized adaptive therapy based on a direct biomarker of liver function can be used to achieve both high rates of local control and a high degree of safety without sacrificing either.

Materials/Methods: We analyzed the prospective collected data of 172 patients who received palliative IHRT from May-2006 to Apr-2017. All patients had advanced HCC > 5cm ineligible for curative interventions. Out of 172 patients, 100 (58.1%) were refractory to loco-regional therapy and received RT alone, and 72 (41.9%) received single dose of TACE at 4 weeks before RT. IHRT was delivered by stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) techniques at 4 Gy/fractions (fr) daily for 5 to 10 fr, which was determined by tumor size/volume, V30/mean dose of uninvolved liver, and proximity of bowel. No scheduled treatment was given unless disease progression. Result(s): Median age was 61 years (interquartile range: 29 - 90 years). HCC was related to hepatitis B virus in 79.1%, hepatitis C virus in 5.8%, and alcoholism in 5.8%. There were 80.8% CP A, 19.2% B. There were 34.9% who had portal vein or IVC thrombosis, 27.3% had extra-hepatic metastasis. Median tumor size was 12.2 cm (interquartile range: 8.5 - 16.0 cm) and median volume was 718.2 ml (interquartile range: 249.6 - 1577.9 ml). The median total equivalent dose in 2Gy per fraction (EQD2, a/b=10) was 32.7 Gy (4Gy x 7) (Range: 23.3 - 46.7 Gy). The median follow-up time was 11.2 months (Range: 0.2 - 134.3 months). One hundred fifty-six patients had died at the time of analysis. Of the surviving 16 patients, the median follow-up time was 34.6 months (Range: 13.6 - 131.7 months). The best response (RECIST) was 2.6% CR, 46.1 % PR, 40.1% SD, and 11.2% PD. The 1-year and 2-year local control rate was 78.8 % (95% Cl, 70.4 - 84.9%) and 63.8 % (95% Cl, 51.8 - 72.7%) respectively. The overall median OS was 11.1 months (95% Cl, 9.3 - 13.0 months). Patients received TACE + RT had significantly better local control and overall survival than RT alone (Table 1). Treatment related death occurred in 4 patients (2.3%). Two patients did not complete IHRT. The commonest >= grade 3 toxicities were anemia (8.7%), thrombocytopenia (4.1%). There were 17.9% of patients without disease progression had decline of CP class in 3 months. One patient developed non-classical radiation-induced liver injury (RILD). Conclusion(s): IHRT with low to moderate dose achieves effective local control with manageable toxicity in advanced HCC patients. The survival outcome compared favorably to historical results in similar population. Patients received TACE + RT had better outcome than RT alone. Randomized trial to evaluate adding IHRT to the standard of care is warranted. [Figure presented]Copyright © 2019",exclusion,Wrong comparator,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.06.175

It has been hypothesized that SBRT may translate to a better quality of life by delaying the need for systemic chemotherapy and possibly increasing survival. There is limited published literature on the efficacy of SBRT in limited nodal metastases. The primary aim is to review institutional outcomes of patients with solitary or oligometastatic lymph nodes treated with SBRT. METHODS: A retrospective study of patients treated with SBRT to metastatic lymph nodes (March 2010-June 2015) was conducted. Endpoints of this study were local control (LC), chemotherapy-free survival (CFS) following SBRT, toxicities, progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Eighteen patients with a mean age of 65 years underwent SBRT to metastatic lymph nodes. Median follow-up was 33.6 months. There were four hepatocellular carcinoma, seven colorectal, four pancreatic, one esophageal, one gallbladder and one lung primary. Eleven (61%) patients had lymph node metastases at initial presentation of metastatic disease. Seven patients (39%) had systemic therapy prior to SBRT, with five patients receiving two lines of chemotherapy. Eight patients had solitary metastatic disease at the time of radiotherapy. All patients had <5 metastases. Median size of lymph node metastases was 1.95 cm (range: 0.8-6.2 cm). RT doses were 31 to 60 Gy in four to ten fractions, with 44% of patients receiving 35 Gy in 5 fractions. At 1 year, LC was 94% and CFS from SBRT was 60%. One-year PFS and OS were 39% and 89% respectively. There were no grade 3 or higher toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: In this single institution study, SBRT to oligometastatic lymph nodes provided excellent LC and a moderate chemotherapy-free interval with minimal toxicities. Disease progression remains prominent in these patients and larger studies are warranted to identify those who benefit most from SBRT.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.1186/s13014-017-0820-1

The use of Proton vs X-ray for SBRT is attractive given the advantage of a lack of an exit dose. The exit dose is responsible for high integral dose of radiation in the liver. This significantly limits the ability to administer subsequent courses which is important as it is not uncommon for patients to develop out-of-field recurrences. Objective(s): For the Phase I portion, the objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Proton SBRT for liver metastases. The Phase II portion is to evaluate treatment efficacy defined by local control within irradiated field. Method(s): An IRB approved Phase I/II clinical trial was conducted. Eligible patients had 1-3 liver metastases measuring less than 5c m, and no metastases location within 2 cm of the GI tract. For the Phase I portion, dose escalation was conducted with three dose cohorts. The low, intermediate, and high dose cohorts were planned to receive 36 Gy, 48 Gy, and 60 Gy respectively to the planning target volume (PTV) in 3 fractions (fx). At least 700 cc of normal liver had to receive <15 Gy. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) included acute Grade 3 liver, intestinal or spinal cord toxicity or any Grade 4 toxicity. The MTD was defined as the dose level below that which results in DLT in 2 or more of the 6 patients in the highest dose level cohort. The Phase II portion has commenced, with the dose of 60 Gy in 3 fx. Result(s): Nine patients were enrolled to the Phase I portion. No patient experienced a DLT and dose was escalated to 60 Gy in 3 fx without reaching MTD. Therefore, 60 Gy in 3 fx was continued as the dose for Phase II. Thus far, 6 patients with 9 total lesions are included in the Phase II portion (3 male, 3 female): most common primary, colorectal (4 patients), median tumor diameter 2.8 cm (1.4-3.8 cm), median tumor volume 7.5 cc (1.4-11.1 cc). All patients tolerated treatment well, with only one patient experiencing toxicity (Grade 1 fatigue). With a median follow up of 9.8 months (range 1 33 months), there have been no local failures. Conclusion(s): Interim results of our Phase I/II trial 60 Gy in 3 fx with Proton SBRT suggest excellent local control outcomes not only with minimal toxicity, but also affording the option of subsequent courses for out-of-field liver recurrences. These results may also be able to be incorporated into other trials, such as immunotherapy trials using SBRT to target multiple metastases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

random-journal.pdf,LivM110,"van den Wollenberg, Wouter",2019,eng,LIV.M:#2,Investigating the impact of patient arm position in an MR-linac on liver SBRT treatment plans.,"PURPOSE: The superior soft-tissue contrast offered by the integrated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the Unity MR-linac compared to the x-ray-based image guidance on conventional linacs potentially allows for liver stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) without the need for implanted markers or other surrogates. On conventional linacs, liver SBRT patients are typically positioned with their arms above their heads (arms-up) to minimize exposure to healthy tissue. However, the spatial confinement of the MRI-bore and increased treatment delivery times can make the arms-up position straining. Therefore, we assessed the plan quality for MR-linac treatment plans with the patient in the arms-up and in the arms-down position. Additionally, we compared the MR-linac plans with clinically used arms-up treatment plans made for a conventional linac. METHODS: Fifteen consecutively treated patients with oligometastatic liver disease were included in this retrospective study. For each patient, a planning computed tomography (CT) with delineations, a diagnostic MRI, and a 3 × 20 Gy dual-arc volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plan, which was used to treat the patient in an arms-up position on the conventional linac, were available. For the MR-linac, 15-beam step-and-shoot intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans were created for four patient positioning scenarios: arms-up, mimicking current clinical practice; arms-down, with treatment beams avoiding the arms on the entrance side; arms-through, arms are down but not avoided, and right-arm-up; only the right arm is up and the left arm is avoided on the entrance side. Resulting treatment plans were compared. Bonferroni-corrected two-sided Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests were used to assess statistical significance (P < 0.05). RESULTS: No significant differences were found in gross tumour volume (GTV) coverage (D 2% , D 50% , and D 98% ) or liver sparing (liver-GTV V < 15Gy ) between the clinical plans and any of the MR-linac plans. The median target conformity [exterior V 40% /planning target volume (PTV)] was significantly better in the clinical plans (5.8) than in the MR-linac scenarios (arms-down: 6.6, arms-up/right-arm-up: 6.2, arms-through: 6.3). No MR-linac plan violated any additional organ-at-risk (OAR) constraint that was not already violated in the clinical plans. In the arms-down scenario a significantly increased median spinal cord D 1% (14.5 Gy) was detected compared to the clinical setup (7.2 Gy). For the arms-down (arms-through) scenario, the median left arm D 1% was 1.5 (2.7) Gy, the median right arm D 1% was 5.8 (22.7) Gy, and the median right arm V 20Gy was 0.0 (14.7) cc. These differences were statistically significant. For the right-arm-up scenario, the median left arm D 1% (2.3 Gy) and V 5Gy (0.0) were not significantly different compared to the arms-down scenario. CONCLUSIONS: Mimicking the current clinical practice by treating patients in the arms-up/right-arm-up position on the MR-linac leads to plans which are dosimetrically very similar to the conventional linac plans. Treating in the arms-down position is expected to increase patient comfort at the cost of a small reduction in OAR sparing for individual patients. Treating through the arms is not encouraged due to substantial dose deposition in the arms.",exclusion,Other study,,10.1002/mp.13826
random-journal.pdf,LivM111,"J., Chen",2017,English,LIV.M:#2,Investigation of delivered stereotactic body radiation therapy doses in hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with concurrent sorafenib,"Purpose/Objective(s): A phase I trial of liver SBRT and Sorafenib (pre-concurrent and post) resulted in serious toxicities in HCC patients, but not in a parallel trial in liver metastases. Unanticipated reductions in liver volume were also observed during SBRT potentially impacting dosimetry. Delivered SBRT doses were reconstructed to investigate if the differential toxicity profiles were related to delivered doses or underlying patient biology. Purpose/Objective(s): HCC (N=14) and metastases (N=14) patients treated on the Phase I trials with individualized SBRT (30-54 Gy in 6 fractions, determined by liver and luminal gastrointestinal (GI) tissue doses) and concurrent Sorafenib were investigated. Daily SBRT doses were retrospectively recalculated on each density-corrected cone-beam CT (accuracy <2%) acquired for image-guidance. Biomechanical deformable registration (accuracy <image resolution) mapped the daily doses to the planning CT to sum the total delivered dose. Planned and delivered doses for normal liver (mean, D800cc) and GI tissues (max 0.5cc) for 5 HCC patients with toxicity (4 with liver function decline, 2 with GI toxicity) were compared to those without. Result(s): Over 28 patients the average delivered mean and D800cc liver doses were 4% and 7% higher than planned, and 5% higher for the stomach (P<=0.006). 13 patients had max GI doses >=30 Gy at planning, and 5 of these (4 HCC, 1metastases) had delivered doses changes of at least 5% in magnitude (range-16% to 11%). Delivered doses for patients with and without toxicity (Table) had similar dose levels in the upper ranges (in brackets in the Table), as did the HCC and metastases cohorts. Patients with toxicity had higher average bowel doses, and this was consistent for patients with similar biology (HCC patients with and without toxicity). One HCC patient with a lower GI bleed had a delivered large bowel dose of 33.4 Gy (3% higher than planned). Similar doses were also delivered in 2 HCC (0%, 8% change) and 1 metastases (0% change) patients without toxicity. Another HCC patient with a small bowel obstruction had a delivered dose of 36.9 Gy (4% higher than planned), the highest across all patients. Conclusion(s): HCC patients may have a higher propensity for toxicity from concurrent SBRT and Sorafenib compared to metastases patients. High delivered normal tissue doses correlated with serious complications, though similar doses were seen in some liver metastases patients without toxicity. As delivered doses can be higher than planned, dose reconstruction may enable online monitoring and plan adaptation to reduce normal tissue doses and the risk of toxicities in future patients.",exclusion,Other study design,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.06.1068

After SRS alone, the median survival is poor (5.6 months). Ipilimumab (Anti CTLA‐4) was the first checkpoint inhibitor to demonstrate a survival benefit in patients with metastatic melanoma. The median survival was more recently estimated at 6 months after initiation of ipilimumab alone for brain metastasis. No prospective studies have evaluated the use of ipilimumab in combination with stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of brain metastasis from MM. Methods: This open‐label, multi‐center, phase 2 study (NCT02662725) evaluated the efficacy of one administration of ipilimumab (10 mg/kg) followed by SRS and the maintenance ipilimumab in a cohort of patients with MM brain metastases. Inclusion criteria included: patients of 18 years or older, performance status 0‐1, fewer than 4 brain metastases on MRI. The primary objective was to show an increase at least 50% of the median overall survival time of patients receiving SRS alone. The secondary endpoints were to determine the safety profile of the combination, the intra‐ and extra‐brain response rate. This study was supported by Bristol‐Myers Squibb. Results: 57 patients (32 males) were enrolled. Median age was 54 (47‐67). The study met his primary endpoint: median survival time was 13.2 m, higher than the median survival time of 5.6 m in the reference population (HR = 0.29; 95%CI = 0.19 to 0.39; p < 0.0001). The disease control rate was 49% (28/57). The most serious treatment‐related adverse events were colitis (10.5%), hepatitis (10.5%), hypophisitis (8.77%) and headhache (8.77%). One radionecrosis was observed. Conclusions: High dose Ipilimumab plus SRS seemed effective with a manageable safety profile in patients with brain MM. Considering that this is the best survival rate ever observed in this setting, these results seem to confirm a synergy in the combination of immunotherapy and radiotherapy and should be confirmed in a randomized trial.",exclusion,"Other study design, wrong intervention, other patients",,10.1200/JCO.2018.36.15-suppl.9520

Combination approaches have been used to increase immunogenicity of tumors and enhance response rates. In a phase II study, ipilimumab (ipi) with SABR to metastatic lesions has shown promising results in different tumor types. Here, we report data on the thyroid cancer expansion cohort part of that trial. Single institution study using sequential ipi (3mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses) with SABR (50 Gy in 4 fractions or 60 Gy in 10 fractions to metastatic liver or lung lesions). SABR was delivered beginning the week after the second ipi dose. Best response (both irradiated and non-irradiated lesions) was calculated using standard immune related response criteria. Between 2/2016 and 1/2018, 19 pts with thyroid cancer were enrolled; 53% female; median age of diagnosis was 57 years (r: 36-68); 6 differentiated (DTC), 6 poorly differentiated (PDTC), 4 anaplastic (ATC), 3medullary (MTC). Prior to study entry, all pts had progressive disease (PD) and 8 received 1 kinase inhibitor (KI). All pts received 1 ipi, 8 (42%) received all 4 ipi, and 15 (79%) received SABR. Immune related stable disease (irSD) was noted in 10/19 (53%) pts (1 ATC, 1MTC and 8 DTC/PDTC); 9/19 (47%) pts had irPD, of which 4 had irPD prior to SABR (2 ATC, 2 PDTC).Median progression free survival (PFS) was 20 weeks (95%CI 0.0, 41.3) in the entire population and 34 weeks (95%CI 3.7, 64) in pts who completed SABR. Median OS was not reached at median follow up of 32 weeks (95%CI 0, 65). In pts with irSD, median PFS was 71 weeks (95%CI 15.6, 126.4) and they are all alive. In pts with PD on KI: 25% irSD and 75% irPD; median PFS was 9 weeks (95%CI 0.7, 17.3). In KI naive pts: 73% irSD and 27% irPD; median PFS was 34 weeks (95%CI NR, NR). Five pts discontinued ipi due to toxicity (3 colitis, 1 hypophysitis, and 1 clinical deterioration); all had irSD.

random-journal.pdf,LivM114,,2019,English,LIV.M:#1,Irreversible electroporation,"Learning Objectives 1. To discuss the latest developments 2. To discuss latest results 3. To discuss future perspectives Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in Europe and the United States1. Five-year relative survival of patients with pancreatic cancer is currently as low as 8%1. An important factor attributing to the dismal survival rate is that most patients are diagnosed with advanced disease, due to the lack of symptoms at early-stage pancreatic cancer1. Surgical resection with adjuvant chemotherapy is regarded as the best treatment option for long-term survival. However less than 20% of patients present with resectable disease, and even in this subset of patients median overall survival (mOS) after successful resection and adjuvant therapy is only approximately 28 months2. Furthermore, one third of the patients develop isolated local recurrence after resection 3, which unfortunately is most often unresectable because of vascular involvement4. About 30% of patients present with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC; American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage III), defined as >180degree circumference tumor encasement of the superior mesenteric artery or coeliac arteries, or any unreconstructable venous involvement2. For these patients gemcitabine based regimens, with or without radiation, have long been the standard of care, resulting in a mOS of approximately 9-11 months5-7. The use of FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) has clearly improved survival, although the prognosis for LAPC remains poor with a median OS of approximately 12-14 months8-10. Given the poor survival of patients with LAPC, even without early distant metastases, several groups are focusing on combining systemic chemotherapy with local ablative therapies. Due to the unacceptable complication rate caused by the heat-related injury to critical blood vessels, bile ducts and gastro-intestinal structures radical thermal ablation in the pancreas has largely been abandoned, though the Verona and Utrecht groups (PELICAN study) continue to investigate partial debulking RFA, heating only the central part of the tumor, for LAPC patients11. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a primarily nonthermal ablative technique, in which high-voltage electrical pulses irreversibly damage the cellular membrane by creating nanopores, inducing cell death through apoptosis12. Several studies confirmed the safety profile of IRE with encouraging survival outcomes and median survival times reaching 15 - 32 months from diagnosis11. Most studies, however, are retrospective, limited in sample size and have a relatively short followup. The aim of the PANFIRE-1 and PANFIRE-2 trials was to stepwise and critically assess the efficacy and long-term safety of percutaneous IRE for LAPC and isolated unresectable local recurrences following surgical resection of pancreatic cancer and to compare with the current standard of care FOLFIRINOX +/- radiotherapy. FOLFIRINOX plus percutaneous IRE was superior to a matched group of patients treated with FOLFIRINOX alone with regards to overall survival, disease - and local progression free survival. The currently ongoing phase II/III Amsterdam based CROSSFIRE trial compares FOLFIRINOX plus IRE to FOLFIRINOX plus MR-guided SBRT. The FDA embedded and US-based DIRECT project will in the near future compare FOLFIRINOX +/- SBRT to FOLFIRINOX plus IRE and combine this with a prospective 15-center registry. Although, in the absence of a direct comparison, the approach will be topic for debate for decades to come, the results from retrospective series seem to indirectly favor a percutaneous approach13-15. With lower complication rates, shorter hospital stay and on average longer median survival times from literature, presumably including a 25% worse-off subgroup of poor-prognosis patients with imaging-occult peritoneal disease and/ or liver metastases that would not have gotten open-IRE following that approach, it seems just to prefer the less-invasive percutaneous route. In the PANFIRE-1 trial it was shown for the first time that tumor ablation through IRE in humans can open a therapeutic window leading to activation of tumor-specific effector T cells16. A consistent and selective post- IRE up-regulation of PD-1 on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood (revealing a phenotype likely amenable to PD-1 blockade) and increased frequencies of WT-1 specific T cells (by IFN-gamma elispot) were detected. This data delivers important first-in-man evidence of bona fide T cell activation and in vivo vaccination after IRE. These results were recently confirmed by Pandit et al. in a study showing decreased T-regs in peripheral blood at day 3-5 following in-human surgical IRE17. In mouse models, contrary to thermal ablation, cryotherapy and ionizing radiation, IRE has proven highly immunogenic, leading to the release of free ATP and HMGB1, and T cell induction, and to have a synergistic effect with PD-1 blockade achieving highly efficient tumor control with durable complete responses and in the majority of mice complete resistance to regrowth when rechallenged18, 19. These mesmerizing animal-study results will be put to the test in humans in the future PANFIRE-3 trial comparing and combining IRE with local immune boosting drugs (CPG as toll-like receptor 9 ligand) plus immune checkpoint inhibition (PD-1 blockade) in oligometastatic pancreatic cancer. To conclude, evidence to support the use of IRE over chemotherapy alone in LAPC patients is gradually surfacing and the results from prospective studies seem to confirm earlier retrospective data. The remarkable immune-modulatory effect of using pulsed electrical fields in pancreatic cancer, with the advent to increase neo-antigen presentation, to reduce immune-suppression and induce a pro-inflammatory micro-environment has opened an immense platform for future research and it may radically change the treatment paradigm for pancreatic cancer patients as well as the way we as interventional radiologists will treat pancreatic cancer in the future.",exclusion,Other study,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00270-019-02282-x

Practical clinical considerations raise the question.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the role of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) as a local ablative treatment (LAT) in oligometastatic pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Patients affected by histologically confirmed stage IV pancreatic adenocarcinoma were included in this analysis. Endpoints are local control (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: From 2013 to 2017, a total of 41 patients were treated with SBRT on 64 metastases. Most common sites of disease were lung (29.3%) and liver (56.1%). LC at 1 and 2 years were 88.9% (95% CI 73.2-98.6) and 73.9% (95% CI 50-87.5), respectively. Median LC was 39.9 months (95% CI 23.3-not reached).PFS rates at 1 and 2 years were 21.9% (95% CI 10.8-35.4) and 10.9% (95% CI 3.4-23.4), respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results, although based on a retrospective analysis of a small number of patients, show that patients with oligometastatic pancreatic cancer may benefit from local treatment with SBRT. Larger studies are warranted to confirm these results.

The purpose of this study is to identify clinical factors that can serve to predict for LMD at the time of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases from breast carcinoma. We conducted a retrospective review of patients with brain metastases from breast cancer treated with SRS from 1995 to 2014 at our institution. Clinical, radiographic, and dosimetric data were collected. LMD was diagnosed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology or MRI demonstrating CSF seeding. Comparative statistical analyses were conducted using Cox proportional hazards regression, binary logistic regression, and/or log-rank test. 126 patients met inclusion criteria. Eighteen patients (14 %) developed LMD following SRS. From the time of SRS, the actuarial rate of LMD at 12 months from diagnosis of brain metastasis was 9 % (11 patients). Active disease in the chest at the time of SRS was associated with development of LMD (p = 0.038). Factors including receptor status, tumor size, number of intra-axial tumors, cystic tumor morphology, prior WBRT, active bone metastases, and active liver metastases were not significantly associated with the development of LMD. In patients with brain metastasis from breast cancer that undergo SRS, there is a relatively low rate of LMD. We found that while tumor hormonal status, bone metastases, and hepatic metastases were not associated with the development of LMD, active lung metastases at SRS was associated with LMD. Further research may help to delineate a causative relationship between metastatic lung disease and LMD.",exclusion,Wrong patients,,10.1007/s11060-015-1854-6

Of 68 lesions treated, 38 were in bone (56%), 19 were in lung (28%), 8 were in lymph nodes (12%), and 3 were in liver (4%). The median follow-up was 17.9 months (range, 5-31.5 months). The 6-month (6mo) freedom from local progression (FFLP) by treated lesion for prostate, sarcoma, and other primary tumor sites was 91.7%, 56.3%, and 62.5%, respectively (p<0.0001). FFLP by patient for site of metastases in the liver/bone, lymph node, and lung was 77.3%, 100%, and 66.7%, respectively (p=0.11). FFLP by lesion for site of metastases in the liver/bone, lymph node, and lung was 78.0%, 100%, and 63.2%, respectively (p=0.02). Compared with prostate cancer, sarcoma or other primary histologies had higher risk of developing local progression, with HR of 12.1 (p=0.003) and 11.2 (p=0.0027), respectively on univariate analysis. Receiving protocol treatment to 3 or more lesions compared to 1 lesion was associated with a significantly higher FFLP (HR=3.2, p=0.03). Conclusion(s): Local control of the treated lesion after SBRT and nelfinavir was significantly higher in patients with prostate cancer compared to sarcomas and other solid tumor histologies. Additionally, patients who received protocol treatment to one lesion were more likely to be locally controlled than those who received treatment to three or more sites. Prostate cancer patients with less than 3 metastatic lesions may derive the most therapeutic benefit from SBRT delivered to 15 Gy in one fraction in combination with nelfinavir.",exclusion,"Wrong patients, wrong intervention",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.06.1870

Method(s): We extracted data of patients treated between 2009 and 2016. Inclusion criteria were: (1) maximum diameter of the liver lesions less than 4 cm; (2) no more than three liver lesions; (3) no evidence of progressive or untreated gross disease outside the liver; (4) adequate liver function; (5) no concurrent chemotherapy; (6) minimum age of 18. Tumour response was classified according to EORTC-RECIST criteria. Aim of the present study was to evaluate freedom from local progression (FFLP). To reduce indication bias, an inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to estimate treatment effect. Result(s): A total of 135 patients with 214 lesions were included in the analysis. Median follow-up time was 24.5 months (range 2.4-95.8). The 1-year freedom from local progression (FFLP) was 88% (95%CI 80-92). In the SBRT group, FFLP was statistically longer than MWA group (p = 0.0214); the 1-year FFLP was 91% (95% CI 81-95) in SBRT group and 84% (95% CI 0.72-0.91) in MWA group.

Thirty to 70 % of patients affected by CRC will develop liver metastases, often isolated sites of disease. In patients not suitable for resection of metastases both thermal ablation and Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) demonstrated high rates of control of disease. The outcome after treatment with SBRT seems not to be affected by the size of lesions. Considering that Microwave ablation (MWA) seems to be more efficient in the treatment of larger lesions compared to Radiofrequency ablation (RFA). The study aim was to compare the disease control in two groups of patients affected by liver metastases from CRC treated with SBRT or MWA. Material and Methods We conducted a retrospective comparative analysis of all patients with CRC liver metastases who underwent either MWA or SBRT between January 2009 to October 2016 from a prospectively maintained registry database . Inclusion criteria were: 1) maximum diameter of the liver lesions less than 4 cm; 2) no more than 3 liver lesions; 3) no evidence of progressive or untreated gross disease outside the liver; 4) no concurrent chemotherapy; 5) minimum age of 18. Tumour response was classified according to European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (EORTC-RECIST) criteria version 1.16. Toxicity was classified according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3. Results A total of 135 patients with 214 liver lesions were included in the analysis. Patients were more likely treated with SBRT if they were male and older than 70 years old. MWA was more likely the treatment of choice in case of smaller lesion and in the presence of one single metastasis. Median follow-up time was 24.5 months (range 2.4 - 95.8). A total of 41 lesions relapsed after the treatment (21 for MWA group and 20 for SBRT group). The 1-year FFLP was 88% (95%CI 80 - 92). In the SBRT group, FFLP was statistically longer than MWA group (p = 0.0214), the 1-year FFLP was 91% (95%CI 81 - 95) in SBRT group and 84% (95%CI 0.72 - 0.91 in MWA group. Patients treated with SBRT showed a reduce risk of local relapse compared to MWA (adjusted HR 0.31; 95%CI 0.13 - 0.70, p= 0.005). As expected analogous result, was obtained in the inverse probability weighting analysis (HR 0.38; 95%CI 0.18 - 0.80; p = 0.011). Stratified analysis by lesion dimension confirmed the better prognosis in SBRT than in MWA group in patients with at least one lesion bigger than 30 mm and not in patients with all lesions equal or smaller than 30 mm. Conclusion In conclusion, there seems to be an advantage of SBRT compared to MWA in treating CRC liver metastases, particularly for lesions bigger than 30 mm.

Radiation treatment for liver can be a clinical challenge due to multiple lesions, respiratory motion, liver organ deformation and difficulty visualising the tumour on CT and CBCT scans. These multiple challenges required the collaboration of an interdisciplinary team of Radiation Therapists, Radiation Oncologists and Medical Physicists to enhance the radiation therapy imaging, planning and treatment process. Collaboration was also necessary with MRI Radiographers and Nuclear Medicine Technologists to ensure their images were optimal for Liver SABR. We will detail how the Nepean team needed to reach beyond our previous SABR experience utilising our existing equipment in new ways to overcome the following challenges for Liver SABR: I. Patient immobilisation II. Respiratory motion management using End Expiration Breath Hold III. Acquisition of triple phase IV contrast planning CTs IV. Image registration of multiple CT, MRI and PET scans V. PTV delineation between multimodality imaging with liver deformation VI. Achieving the highest prescribed dose using a highly conformal VMAT technique, while sparing the nearby radiosensitive gastrointestinal tissues and remaining healthy liver VII. Optimising the image quality for IGRT and the use of tumour surrogates for localisation in daily IGRT VIII.

random-journal.pdf,LivM121,"Jarraya, Hajer",2015,eng,LIV.M:#4,Lobulated enhancement evaluation in the follow-up of liver metastases treated by stereotactic body radiation therapy.,"OBJECTIVE: The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) can have limitations when used to evaluate local treatments for cancer, especially for liver malignancies treated by stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The aim of this study was to validate the relationship between the occurrence of lobulated enhancement (LE) and local relapse and to evaluate the utility of this relationship for predicting local progression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Imaging data of 59 lesions in 46 patients, including 281 computed tomographic (CT) scans, were retrospectively and blindly reviewed by 3 radiologists. One radiologist measured the lesion size, for each CT and overall, to classify responses using RECIST threshold criteria. The second studied LE occurrence. A third radiologist was later included and studied LE occurrence to evaluate the interobserver consistency for LE evaluation. RESULTS: The mean duration of follow-up was 13.6 months. LE was observed in 16 of 18 progressive lesions, occurring before size-based progression in 50% of cases, and the median delay of LE detection was 3.2 months. The sensitivity of LE to predict progression was 89%, and its specificity was 100%. The positive predictive value was 100%, the negative predictive value was 95.3%, and the overall accuracy was 97%. The probability of local progression-free survival at 12 months was significantly higher for lesions without LE compared with all lesions: 0.80 (CI 95%: 0.65-0.89) versus 0.69 (CI 95%: 0.54-0.80), respectively. The overall concordance rate between the 2 readers of LE was 97.9%. CONCLUSION: Response assessment of liver metastases treated by SBRT can be improved by including LE. This study demonstrates the diagnostic and predictive utility of LE for assessing local progression at a size still eligible for local salvage treatment.",exclusion,"Other study, no comparator",,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2015.01.028

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A cohort of 70 patients with 103 colorectal liver metastases were treated with SBRT at a single institution. The prescribed doses were 45 to 60 Gy in 3 to 4 fractions, but these were modified according to the tolerance of the adjacent normal tissue. To allow for dose comparisons, a biological equivalent dose was calculated. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 34.2 months (range, 5.3-121.8 months). The 2-year overall survival and progression-free survival rates were 75% and 35%, respectively. In subgroups, the 2-year local control rates for biological equivalent dose ≤80 Gy (group 1), 100 to 112 Gy (group 2), and ≥132 Gy (group 3) were 52%, 83%, and 89%, respectively. Cox proportional hazards model revealed a significant difference between groups (hazard ratio 0.44, P=.03 for group 2; hazard ratio 0.17, P=.17 for group 3; P=.01 for total). The major pattern of failure was a new liver metastasis out of the SBRT field. There was no grade ≥3 toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic body radiation therapy of liver metastases derived from colorectal cancer offers a locally effective treatment without significant complications. Longer local control can be expected if higher doses are used.

METHODS: Patients with metastatic CRC treated with SBRT on metastatic lesions were retrospectively analyzed between February 2012 and August 2016 at the General University Hospital of Valencia. The follow‐up was carried out until July 15, 2018. The data have been collected in a database. Patients may have received prior systemic therapy and/or resection of metastatic disease. Endpoints were timed from end of SBRT and included overall survival (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS). Univariate and multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to identify prognostic factors. RESULTS: A total of 49 patients were identified. Before SBRT, 77.5% of the patients have received systemic therapy and 65.2% surgery for metastatic disease. Of metastatic lesions treated with SBRT 53.1% were located in the lung, 30.6% in the liver and 16.3% in other locations. Median survival were: PFS after treatment with SBRT was 9.9 months (95% CI: 4.64‐15.1) and the median OS was 28.9 months (95% CI: 19.0‐38.7).

Data on long-term outcomes are limited. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This prospective, multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 trial was initiated in 2010 and enrolled patients with oligometastatic NSCLC. Oligometastatic disease was defined as a maximum of 5 metastatic lesions for all disease sites, including no more than 3 active extracranial metastatic lesions. Limited mediastinal lymph node involvement was allowed. Patients achieving a partial response or stable disease after 3 to 6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy were treated with CRT to the primary and metastatic sites of disease, followed by observation alone. The primary endpoint was PFS, with secondary endpoints of local control, overall survival (OS), and safety. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were enrolled between October 2010 and October 2015, and 27 were eligible for consolidative radiation therapy. The study was closed early because of slow accrual but met its primary endpoint for success, which was PFS >6 months (P < .0001). The median PFS (95% confidence interval) was 11.2 months (7.6-15.9 months), and the median OS was 28.4 months (14.5-45.8 months). Survival outcomes were not significantly different for patients with brain metastases (P = .87 for PFS; P = .12 for OS) or lymph node involvement (P = .74 for PFS; P = .86 for OS).

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with histologically confirmed CLMs unsuitable for resection or standard therapies were eligible for sequential phase 1 and 2 studies conducted from 2003 to 2012. RESULTS: Of 60 patients treated, 82% had received previous chemotherapy, 23% had undergone previous focal liver treatment, and 38% had extrahepatic disease at the time of SBRT. The median number of gross tumor volume (GTV) targets per patient was 1 (range, 1-6), with a median total target volume of 117.7 cm(3) (range, 6.7-3115.4 cm(3)). The median minimum dose to the GTV was 37.6 Gy (range, 22.7-62.1 Gy) in 6 fractions over a period of 2 weeks. Other than 1 case of grade 3 nausea, there were no acute toxicities greater than grade 2. With a median follow-up period of 28.1 months for survivors, no gastrointestinal bleed or biliary or liver toxicity was seen. The local control rate per lesion at 1 and 4 years was 49.8% and 26.2%, respectively. Increasing minimum dose to the GTV was associated with improved local control (P=.003). Median overall survival was 16.0 months (95% confidence interval, 11.9-20.5 months). On multivariate analysis, improved survival was associated with smaller total GTV (P=.017), performance status of 0 or 1 (P=.007), no extrahepatic disease at the time of treatment (P=.005), and local control of targeted liver disease (P=.001). Two long-term survivors remain disease free at 49 and 125 months. CONCLUSIONS: Six-fraction SBRT for CLM is safe and may be associated with long-term cure. Local control was significantly associated with delivered dose and was lower than seen in other studies using a higher SBRT dose. Survival was associated with smaller tumor volume, absence of extrahepatic disease, performance status of 0 or 1, and local control of treated liver lesions.",exclusion,"No comparator, wrong study design",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.04.010

There is need to investigate additional therapeutic options that would intensify the initial response to TACE. The present study was to retrospectively compare the outcome and evaluate the prognostic factors of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) alone or as an adjunct to transarterial embolization (TAE) or TACE in the treatment of HCC >5 cm. METHODS: From January 2011 to April 2015, 77 patients received SBRT followed by TAE or TACE (TAE/TACE + SBRT group) and 50 patients received SBRT alone (SBRT group). The dose of SBRT was 30-50 Gy which was prescribed in 3-5 fractions. Eligibility criteria were: a longest tumor diameter >5.0 cm and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) Class A or B. Exclusion criteria included tumor thrombus, lymph node involvement and extrahepatic metastasis. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 20.5 months. Median tumor size was 8.5 cm (range, 5.1-21.0 cm). Median overall survival (OS) in the TAE/TACE + SBRT group was 42.0 months versus 21.0 months in the SBRT group. The 1-, 3- and 5-year OS was 75.5, 50.8, and 46.9 % in the TAE/TACE + SBRT group and was 62.4, 32.9, and 32.9 % in the SBRT group, respectively (P = 0.047).

For the most, long-term survival data is missing raising questions with regard to the efficacy of such modalities when compared to surgical resection. Radiosurgery using the CyberKnife device enables the treatment of liver lesions with a single-session approach. Here we present long-term survival data to explore the curative potential of this strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with oligo-metastatic disease limited to the liver have been treated with single-session or hypo-fractioned radiosurgery in curative intent and prospectively followed until death. Follow-up (FU) was performed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 2 months after radiation and at 3-month intervals for the first 2 years. After that annual computed tomography or MRI scans were performed until 5 years post-treatment. Local recurrence in the radiated volume and recurrence outside the treated volume were used to define local and distant progression. Survival times were censored at the time of the last FU. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-six patients treated between 2005 and 2015 with 194 lesions were included into this study. Median FU was 30.0 months. According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, 55.2% had a complete remission and 11.3% a partial remission. Seventy-two point two percent recurred outside the radiated lesion and median overall survival was 35.2 months with a 3-year survival rate of 47.7%.

We retrospectively reviewed 78 patients with primary and metastatic liver cancers, who underwent SABR using 3 fractions between 2003 and 2011. To examine the incidence of hepatic toxicity, we defined newly developed hepatic toxicity≥grade 2 according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 within 3 months after the end of SABR as a significant adverse event. To identify the predictors for hepatic toxicity, we analyzed several clinical and dosimetric parameters (rV5Gy-rV35Gy: normal liver volume receiving <X Gy, reverse VXGy). Hepatic toxicity≥grade 2 occurred in 10 patients (13%): grade 2 in 9 patients and grade 3 in 1 patient. On univariate analysis, baseline Child-Pugh (CP) score (5 vs. 6-8), normal liver volume, and planning target volume were the significant clinical predictors. All dosimetric parameters were significant: rV20Gy was the most significant predictor. On multivariate analysis, baseline CP score (hazard ratio, 0.026; P=0.001) was the only significant predictor. In conclusion, SABR using 3 fractions in primary and metastatic liver cancers produces low hepatic toxicity, especially in patients with a baseline CP score of 5.

random-journal.pdf,LivM132,"C., Richter",2016,English,LIV.M:#5,MRI imaging of irradiated liver tissue for in vivo verification in particle therapy,"In vivo treatment verification is highly desirable, especially but not only in particle therapy where uncertainties in the particle range can compromise the physical advantage of this treatment modality. Existing measurement techniques for range measurements exploit physical effects, in particular secondary radiation that is produced by the proton beam, for example through activation of positron emitters, or prompt gamma radiation. Also biological effects caused by the irradiation can be used for in vivo treatment verification, if a functional imaging method is available to visualize the effect. One prominent example for biology-driven range verification is an irradiation-induced change in contrast-enhanced MRI of the liver. A strong systematic decrease in uptake of the hepatobiliary-directed contrast agent Gd-EOB-DTPA has been shown in irradiated healthy liver tissue 6-9 weeks after irradiation [1-3] using different treatment modalities (brachytherapy, stereotactic body radiation therapy with photons and protons). The underlying mechanism seems to be based on a pro-inflammatory reaction of the irradiated liver tissue resulting in a downregulation of the Gd-EOB-DTPA uptake transporters and an upregulation of the respective excretion transporters [4]. In a prospective clinical study, carried out at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston (USA), we investigated whether MRI of the liver can be used for in vivo dosimetric verification already during the course of hypo-fractionated proton therapy of liver metastases (5 fractions within 2 weeks). In contrast to the previously found late changes weeks after the end of treatment that were seen in all patients, for the early Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced MR imaging large inter-patient variations were found. For 10 patients, strong or moderate signal changes were detected for 2 and 3 patients, respectively. For 5 patients no dose-correlated early signal change was found at all. This qualitative scoring was consistent with a quantitative voxelwise dose to signal change correlation. The analysis of additional parameters that could potentially explain inter-patient variations (e.g. dose delivered at time of MRI scans, several timing parameters, liver function parameters and circulating biomarkers of inflammation determined from blood samples taken before and during treatment) revealed no clear correlation or trend with the strength of the signal decrease. Hence, irradiation-induced effects in the liver can be detected with Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced MRI within a few days after proton irradiation in a subgroup of patients. As all patients possessed a signal decrease in late follow up scans, only the early dynamics of the liver response is influenced by these inter-patient variations. The reason for these large variations in early response is not yet fully understood and needs further investigation. This presentation will cover a brief overview of biological effects used for treatment verification and will then focus on the irradiation-induced signal change in Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced MRI of the liver. The hypothesis for the biological mechanism, the available data for late and early MRI signal changes will be presented and open questions will be discussed.",exclusion,Wrong intervention,,

In this work we analyzed the correlation of MRI-morphologic alterations with radiation doses to assess the potential for MR-based invivo dosimetry in healthy liver tissue. Materials/Methods: MRI data of 22 patients with liver metastases before and after 7+/-3 weeks after image guided SBRT in computer-controlled deep inspiratory breath hold (DIBH) were analyzed retrospectively. T1- and T2-weighted MRI sequences were matched to the planning CT with the corresponding dose distribution with a commercially available deformable registration algorithm. Isodose lines were directly correlated to the radiologic changes. Absolute doses were converted to BED2 with an alpha/ beta-value of 2 and 3 for healthy liver tissue and 10 for tumor tissue (BED2=Dx (d+alpha/beta)/(2+alpha/ beta)). Result(s): Nominal prescription dose was 48.9+/-14.7Gy (median 60Gy) in single doses of 14.1+/-6.7Gy (median 12Gy). BED2 was 93.9+/-26.8Gy (median 110Gy) for the PTV (alpha/beta10). Central necrosis was observed within the isodose lines of nominally 48.8+/-14.7Gy (median 60Gy), BED2 (alpha/beta10) 93.9+/-26.7Gy (median 110Gy). A surrounding contrast medium accumulation was observed within the isodose lines of nominal 47.4+/-14.9Gy (median 58.5Gy), BED2 (alpha/beta10) 91.8+/-27.4Gy (median 105.8Gy). Outside the high-dose volume, in the region of radiation beam entrance, characteristic sharply defined radiological changes were observed which could be directly correlated to the isodose lines: T1 hypo- or hyperintensity occurred starting at isodose lines of nominally 22.2+/-6.8Gy (median 24Gy), BED2(alpha/beta2) 43.4+/-7.8Gy (median 42Gy), BED2 (alpha/beta3) 39.3+/-6.8Gy (median 37.6Gy). T2-hyper/or hypointensity was observed within isodose lines of nominally 22.4+/-6.7Gy (median 24Gy), BED2 (alpha/beta2) 43.1+/-11.6Gy (median 41.5Gy), BED2 (alpha/beta3) 39.6+/-9.8Gy (median 38,7Gy). No high grade toxicity or changes in liver laboratory values were observed. Conclusion(s): (1) A sharply defined pattern of radiological changes indicates a precise dose application in repetitive breath hold during hypofractionated SBRT. (2) Characteristic radiogenic changes occur in the first post-SBRT MRI. Within the high-dose region of the PTV, tumor necrosis and peripheral contrast medium accumulation can be observed. Beam entrance doses of 37-42Gy (BED2) induce MRI morphologic changes which can be correlated to isodose lines.

We aimed to address this question by reporting the outcome of SCC patients who were treated with organ-directed therapies at two large cancer centers. METHODS: Patients with advanced anal SCC who were treated with surgery, stereotactic radiotherapy, or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with a curative intent from 2008 to 2017 were retrospectively identified from the institutional electronic patient records. RESULTS: Eight patients with liver or lung metastases met the study inclusion criteria. Seven were treated with surgery while one received RFA and radiotherapy. Median progression-free survival was 5 months (range, 4-39). Three patients underwent repeat organ-directed treatment upon failure of the initial surgery with no evidence of further recurrent disease at the last follow-up. Median overall survival from the time of the first organ-directed therapy was 31 months (range, 11-96) with two out of eight patients being alive and disease-free at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that consideration should be given to the adoption of a multidisciplinary treatment approach in carefully selected, oligometastatic anal SCC patients as organ-directed therapies may offer the chance of achieving a relatively long disease control.",exclusion,Wrong intervention,,10.1002/jso.25320

Liver metastasis (mets) are even more common with a wide range of malignancies. Management of both liver affections is a challenging task regarding toxicity toward liver functions. In response, NBTXR3, innovative injectable hafnium oxide nanoparticles activated by radiotherapy, was developed to increase the local deposit of energy within the tumor cells without negatively affecting the liver. It is currently evaluated in a phase I/II clinical trial to introduce the use of NBTXR3 with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with HCC or liver mets [NCT02721056]. Method(s): So far, eleven patients (pts) with HCC with/without with Portal Vein Tumor Thrombosis or liver mets were treated with a single intralesional or intraarterial injection of NBTXR3 followed by SBRT (45Gy / 3 fractions / 5 to 7 days). A 3+3 dose escalation design was implemented with five dose levels equivalent to 10%, 15%, 22%, 33% and 45% of the baseline tumor volume. Primary endpoints were the determination of the Recommended Dose and of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs). Secondary endpoints included the local assessment on target lesions by mRECIST via MRI. Pts are followed until disease progression or study cut-off date. Result(s): Enrollment is currently at the third dose level at 22% (1 pt) and completed for the first two levels at 10% (6 pts) and 15% (4 pts). The treatment resulted with no early DLTs, no adverse events (AE) related to NBTXR3 and no serious AE related to the injection or to SBRT. Dispersion and permanence assessments by CT scan confirmed NBTXR3 to stay within the tumor without negatively impacting liver functions nor the reliability of the image-guided radiation therapy. Conclusion(s): Overall, current results observed a safe and well tolerated profile for NBTXR3 indicating an encouraging perspective in pts highly vulnerable to liver complications.

HCC patients with brain metastasis were investigated to identify their prognostic factors for overall survival. Patients with brain metastasis from HCC who had been treated with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in five hospitals were enrolled in the study. The medical records of the patients were reviewed, and the clinical factors were analyzed to identify the prognostic factors for overall survival. Of the total of 97 patients who were enrolled in the study, 83 were male and the median age at the brain metastases was 56.6 years. Motor weakness (43.3 %) and headache (41.2 %) were common presenting symptoms. The median AFP level was 4180 ng/ml, and 81 patients were assessed as belonging to Child-Pugh classification A upon the diagnosis of brain metastasis. WBRT alone in 71 patients, surgery or radiosurgery combined with WBRT as the adjuvant setting in 18 patients, and WBRT as salvage treatment in 8 patients were performed. The median overall survival of the patients was 3.5 months. In the multivariate analysis, the ECOG performance status (PS), Child-Pugh classification, AFP, and treatment aim showed significant association with the overall survival of the patients. Based on these factors, a nomogram predicting the prognosis was developed. The concordance index of the nomogram was 0.74, and the prediction was well calibrated. In conclusion, the survival outcome of patients with brain metastasis from HCC can be predicted with the nomogram constructed from the ECOG PS, Child-Pugh classification, AFP, and treatment aim.",exclusion,Wrong patients,,10.1007/s11060-015-1926-7

If this aim is met the trial continues as a phase III to evaluate if SBRT/SR improves 5 year overall survival. Secondary aims include local control in the metastatic site, new distant metastatic rate, and technical quality. Translational primary endpoint is to determine whether < 5 CTCs is an independent prognostic marker for improved PFS and OS. Methods: Women with pathologically confirmed metastatic breast cancer to ≤ 4 sites who have been diagnosed within 365 days with metastatic disease and the primary tumor site disease is controlled. CNS metastases are ineligible. ER/PR and HER-2 neu status is required. Site radiation credentialing with a facility questionnaire and pre-treatment review of first case is required. Randomization is to standard systemic therapy with local radiotherapy/ surgery for palliation when necessary versus ablative therapy of all metastases with SBRT and/or SR. For the phase IIR portion to detect a signal for improved median PFS from 10.5 months to 19 months with 95% power and a 1-sided alpha of 0.15 and accounting for ineligible/lost patients, 128 patients will be required.

For the translational research assuming a two-sided probability of type I error of 0.05, the number of patients accrued in the Phase II-R and Phase III portions will provide sufficient power of at least 91% and 93% to detect whether < 5 CTC’s is prognostic for PFS and OS, respectively.

Global mortality from colorectal cancer is approximately half the incidence. An estimated 394,000 colorectal cancer deaths occur worldwide each year, making colorectal cancer the fourth most common cause of cancer death. Overall survival rates after surgical resection of hepatic colorectal metastases were 10‐18% higher than in patients treated with systemic therapy. Hepatic metastases occur in 45% of patients with colorectal cancer. Surgery is the standard of care for resectable diseases, with overall survival rates of 5 years (OS) of 28% ‐58%. Unfortunately, only 10‐20% of patients have a resectable disease at the time of diagnosis. The current approach to treating nonresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) promotes the use of combined cytotoxic therapy. First‐line treatments include cytotoxic combinations. The role of radiotherapy in metastatic cancer is historically palliative, conventional radiotherapeutic techniques causing radiation‐induced liver disease (RLID). With the advent of extracranial stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT), equivalent doses can be safely administered in 3 to 5 fractions, which can result in the removal of all affected tissues in the treated area while limiting the irradiation of the host organ and the healthy tissues surrounding the tumors. The efficacy and safety of SBRT for liver metastases has been confirmed by retrospective studies showing local control rates of about 80% or more. Retrospective studies indicate that approximately 20% of patients remain disease‐free 2 to 4 years after SBRT. For patients treated with SBRT, some authors found that half of the patients had no metastatic progression or very little progression in numbers and metastasis sites. These results confirm the idea of an oligometastatic state in which aggressive local therapy could improve progression‐free survival (PFS). We propose in this study to evaluate the impact of SBRT on progression‐free survival in patients with mCRC with 1‐3 oligometastases of the liver. Two arms will be compared: the standard arm treated with chemotherapy; to the experimental arm combining chemotherapy and SBRT. The chemotherapy will be left free at the choice of the investigator according to the recommendations of national treatments.",exclusion,Wrong intervention and comparator,,

Previous studies have shown that SBRT can stimulate innate and adaptive immunity to potentially augment immunotherapy. In addition, SBRT is used in patients with limited metastatic disease as consolidative approach, showing an improvement overall survival when compared to systemic treatment alone. Combining immunotherapy with ablative therapy is being studied by a number of investigators. While many of these pre-clinical and clinical studies are promising, timing of immunotherapy with SBRT has not be formally studied. Further, few of these studies have addressed treatment of multiple sites of disease and little is known about what molecular changes occur in the tumor microenvironment immediately after ablative therapy. This trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of nivolumab (N) and ipilimumab (I) plus sequential(S) or concurrent(C) SBRT in patients with stage IV NSCLC. Method(s): This is a single-center phase I, open-label, two-arm, randomized platform trial. Eligible patients include those with stage IV NSCLC with >=2 metastatic lesions that meet criteria for SBRT (0.2 cc to 65 cc of viable tumor, larger tumors able to be partially treated up to 65 cc). Eligible patients are simultaneously accrued on arm I (S) and arm II (C) in a 1:1 ratio. Participants in arm I complete SBRT to 2-4 sites followed by initiation of N/I 1-7 days after completion of SBRT. Participants in arm II are treated with N/I within 24-48 hours of SBRT with required SBRT completion to 2-4 sites within two weeks (prior to the second dose of N). Protocol therapy consists of treatment with N 3mg/kg every 2 weeks and I 1mg/kg every 6 weeks for a maximum of 24 months. The primary endpoint is dose-limiting toxicity defined as a >33% rate of grade >=3 toxicity. DLT is defined as any grade >=3 toxicity possibly, likely, or definitely related to SBRT plus N/I (the combination and not the individual components). Secondary endpoints include response rate and progression free survival at 6 months, control rate of treated lesions and non-treated lesions, and comparison of efficacy and toxicity between the arms.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients treated with SBRT to coxal bone metastasis were identified by retrospective chart review. The SBRT doses were 30 Gy or 35 Gy in 5 fractions. A margin of 5 to 10 mm was added to the gross tumor volume to create the clinical target volume. We evaluated the presence or absence of intraosseous recurrence using magnetic resonance imaging. Intraosseous recurrences were assessed as ""in-field"" or ""marginal/out-of-field."" In addition, we measured the distance between the center of the recurrent tumor and the nearest edge of the initial bone metastasis in cases of marginal/out-of-field recurrence. RESULTS: Seventeen patients treated for 17 coxal bone metastases were included. Median age was 64 years (range, 48-79 years). Coxal lesions involved the ilium in 14 cases, pubis in 3, and ischium in 4 (3 lesions crossed over multiple regions). Patients most commonly had renal cell carcinoma (29.4%), followed by lung, hepatic cell, and colorectal cancers (23.5%, 11.8%, and 11.8%, respectively). Median follow-up after SBRT was 13 months (range, 2-44 months). Among all 17 cases, 7 cases developed 8 intraosseous recurrences, including in-field recurrence in 1 case and marginal/out-of-field recurrences in 7 cases. Median time to intraosseous recurrence was 10 months (range, 2-35 months). Among 7 cases with marginal/out-of-field recurrence, mean distance to the center of the recurrent tumor from the nearest edge of the initial bone metastasis was 34 mm (range, 15-55 mm). CONCLUSIONS: Most recurrences were observed out-of-field in the same coxal bone.

random-journal.pdf,LivM146,"H., Chung",2017,English,LIV.M:#2;LIV.P:#1,Perfusion imaging of colorectal liver metastases treated with bevacizumab and SBRT,"Purpose or Objective SBRT is an accepted alternative to surgical resection of liver metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC). The addition of bevacizumab holds promise as a radiosensitizer and is an active agent in metastatic CRC. There is increasing interest in the use of imaging biomarkers as a method to evaluate and predict response to treatment. Dynamic contrast-enhanced CT (DCE-CT) measures perfusion parameters and has been used to evaluate primary CRC tumors and liver metastases. Contrastenhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is another method using a microbubble contrast agent to characterize vascular properties of liver lesions. The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the temporal evolution of perfusion parameters in CRC liver metastases treated with SBRT and bevacizumab. Material and Methods Patients with 1 - 3 liver metastases from CRC were prospectively enrolled in this trial. Bevacizumab was administered for 2 doses 2 weeks apart, with the second dose within 48 hours of starting SBRT. SBRT was delivered in 5 fractions. Functional imaging including DCE-CT and CEUS were performed at three time points: at baseline, just prior to SBRT, and within 7 days post-SBRT. DCE-CT output parameters were permeability surface area (PSA), blood volume (BV), and blood flow (BF). CEUS images were used to calculate a quantitative perfusion index (PI). Patients were then followed with physical and imaging assessments every three months. Results The trial enrolled 11 patients, with 1 dropout. Six patients had a complete set of DCE-CT images (one patient had 2 of 3 scans). Of the 7 evaluable patients, 3, 3 and 1 had evidence of local, distant and simultaneous failure, respectively. Mean PSA and BV decreased in 5 of 6 patients from baseline to post-bevacizumab (-17% +/- 37%, p=0.22 and -25% +/- 33%, p=0.1 respectively), while BF was not affected. BF and PSA was reduced in all 7 patients pre to post-SBRT (-47% +/- 22%, p=0.07 and -40% +/- 21%, p=0.18, respectively) while BV remained stable (0.4% +/- 22%, p=0.8). CEUS was attempted in 10 patients but adequate image acquisition was only technically feasible in 4. CEUS PI significantly decreased from baseline to post bevacizumab (-77% +/- 22%, p=0.048) and had a smaller further decrease after SBRT (-34% +/- 34%, p=0.18). With limited number of patients, there were no differences in changes in any perfusion parameters between patients with and without local failure. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first study in humans that evaluates quantitative CT and US perfusion measures of CRC liver metastases treated with bevacizumab and SBRT. Changes in different measures of perfusion can be detected with these imaging biomarkers. Further study in a larger cohort are needed to better understand temporal changes in perfusion and determine if these changes can be used to predict response to treatment.",exclusion,Wrong intervention,,

Despite promising clinical efficacy as a monotherapy in NSCLC, PD1 inhibitors have produced instances of serious immune-related pneumonitis. We describe early outcomes from a completed two-arm phase I trial combining pembrolizumab with radiation for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Purpose/Objective(s): In NCT02444741 metastatic NSCLC were enrolled in one of two parallel arms. In the stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR) arm, patients were treated to 50 Gy in 4 fractions to a single lung or a liver lesion. In the hypofractionated radiation arm, patients were treated to 45 Gy in 15 fractions to a larger field. A simultaneous integrated boost was allowed up to 60 Gy. Pembrolizumab was given every 3 weeks and initiated the day of or day before the first dose of radiation. The trial design was a 3 + 3 phase I dose escalation testing pembrolizumab at 100 mg and then 200 mg. Both arms were independently escalated. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were grade 3+ toxicity attributable to the combination of both therapies. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by the method of Kaplan and Meier. Result(s): A total of 21 patients were enrolled. Among them, 2 patients did not receive treatment (1 died and 1 withdrew consent). The maximum tolerated pembrolizumab dose was 200 mg for both arms. Among the remaining 19 patients, 10 were treated with SABR (all lung lesions) and 9 with hypofractionated radiation (7 liver and 2 lung lesions). No DLTs were observed. Eight and 3 patients had grade 2 and 3 treatment-related toxicity, respectively. No grade 4 or 5 toxicities were observed. Among the 3 patients who experienced grade 3 toxicities, 1 had pneumonitis and lung infection, 1 had anemia and fatigue, and the last had a maculopapulary rash. Thirteen patients were taken off study for disease progression (n = 9), toxicity (n = 2), and withdrawal of consent (n = 2). The median follow-up time was 7.5 months, with 6-month OS 77% (95% CI: 56%-97%) and PFS 55% (95% CI: 31%-78%). Of the 19 patients who received treatment, the best recorded response was partial response in 6 patients (32%), stable disease in 7 patients (36%), and progressive disease in 6 patients (32%). Conclusion(s): Toxicity associated with pembrolizumab and chest radiation was acceptable. The efficacy, although preliminary, is promising and is being further assessed in the randomized phase II portion comparing radiation and pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab.",exclusion,Other study design,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.06.370 
random-journal.pdf,LivM148,"P., Lee",2017,English,LIV.M:#5;LIV.P:#5,Phase 1 study of stereotactic body radiation therapy for liver tumors utilizing an mri-guided tri-co teletherapy system,"Purpose/Objective(s): The primary objective of this phase I study was to assess the feasibility of utilizing a commercially available MRI-guided tri-60Co teletherapy (MRI-guided tri-co60-RT) system for liver SBRT, as determined by the ability to create treatment plans considered dosimetrically comparable to those that could be delivered with a linear accelerator (LINAC). Secondary objectives included determining tumor local control (LC) and the frequency of acute grade 2-5 gastrointestinal toxicity as determined by CTCAE (version 4). Purpose/Objective(s): Eligible patients had metastatic lesions from another primary site (up to 5 lesions), primary hepatocellular carcinoma, or cholangiocarcinoma and were referred to radiation oncology for liver SBRT. Histologic confirmation of metastases was encouraged but not required. For patients with a single lesion, dose/fractionation regimens included 15 Gy x 3, 16 Gy x 3, and 18 Gy x 3. For patients with multiple lesions, dose/fractionation regimens included 8 Gy x 5, 10 Gy x 5, and 12 Gy x 5. Determination of dose schedule was based on achieving the highest dose while meeting protocol specified normal tissue constraints (adapted from RTOG 1112). LC was defined as stable disease, partial response, or complete response on imaging. Imaging follow-up was based on PET/CT or MRI imaging every 3 months per standard-of-care. Result(s): Sixteen patients were enrolled on our study from July 2015 to September 2016. Four had HCC, two had cholangiocarcinoma, and ten had hepatic metastases. Eleven patients had a single lesion. Overall, 15 of 16 patients (93.8%) had MRI-guided tri-60Co-RT plans that met our dosimetric constraints. The patient who did not have an acceptable MRI-guided tri-60Co-RT plan also did not have an acceptable LINAC-based plan, so was excluded from the study and treated with a dose-reduced schedule. Twenty lesions were treated in total. The median biologically effective dose (BED, assuming a/b=10) used to treat single lesions was 151 Gy. Among plans in which multiple lesions were treated, the median BED per lesion was 132 Gy. The mean gross tumor volume (GTV) for single lesions was 24.1 ml; when multiple lesions were treated, the mean GTV for each lesion was 8.2 ml. At a median imaging follow-up of 5.8 months, LC was 100%. At a median clinical follow-up of 7.2 months, no grade 2 or higher GI toxicities were seen. Conclusion(s): Nearly all patients referred to radiation oncology at our institution for liver SBRT were eligible to receive MRI-guided tri-60Co-RT at ablative doses, as defined by having treatment plans that met adapted RTOG 1112 constraints. LC at a median imaging follow-up of nearly 6 months was 100%, and no grade 2 or higher GI toxicities were seen. Future studies will investigate the ability of the MRI-guided RT system to reduce treatment planning margins and safely allow further dose escalation.",exclusion,Other study design,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.06.993

Materials/Methods: Patients with metastatic disease refractory to standard therapies with >=1 lung or liver lesion amenable to SABR and >=1 additional non-contiguous lesion were enrolled in a nonrandomized fashion. All patients were to receive ipilimumab (3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 cycles) plus radiation given either concomitantly (SABR started on day 2 of cycle 1) or sequentially (SABR given 1 week after the 2nd dose of Ipilimumab). The 5 treatment groups were as follows: concomitant liver 50 Gy, concomitant lung 50 Gy, sequential liver 50 Gy, sequential lung 50 Gy, and sequential 60 Gy (lung or liver for larger lesions). 50 Gy was given in 4 fractions and 60 Gy was given in 10 fractions. Toxicity was scored per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 and were evaluated by medical and radiation oncologists. Disease response was scored per the immune-related response criteria (irRC) by an experienced radiologist. Best responses were reported as complete response (CR), partial response (PR; size decrease >=50%), progressive disease (PD; size increase >=25%), or stable disease (SD; not meeting criteria for PR/CR or PD). The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests were used to assess progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): Among 100 patients (20 in each treatment group), the most common primary histologies were adeno-(nZ55) and squamous cell (nZ13) carcinomas. No grade 4-5 toxicity was observed; 27 grade 3 toxicities were related to ipilimumab (colitis [nZ8], diarrhea [nZ7], liver enzyme elevation [nZ3], bilirubin elevation [nZ1], intestinal obstruction [nZ1], hypophysitis [nZ3], and rash [nZ4]). Two grade 3 toxicities were attributed to combined ipilimumab plus SABR: liver enzyme increase (1%) and pneumonitis (1%). The concurrent and sequential lung groups had 45% and 50% of SD, and 10% and 0% PR, respectively. The concurrent and sequential liver groups showed 35% and 30% of SD, and 5% and 0% PR, respectively. Within the sequential 60 Gy group, 60% showed a favorable response. Lesions from nonesmall cell lung cancer had the highest rate of clinical benefit (SD + PR) at 67%. There was no CR to report. Median PFS time for all patients was 5 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.7e7.2) and median OS time was 12 months (95% CI 9.3e14.6). At 12 months, PFS and OS were better for the sequential lung group than for the sequential liver group (PFS PZ.055, CIZ 3.7e6.4; OS PZ.059, CIZ7.9e20). However, no differences in PFS (PZ.2) or OS (PZ.3) were found between the concurrent lung and liver groups. Conclusion(s): These data suggest that combinations of ipilimumab and SABR have acceptable toxicity profiles and sequential treatment may provide significant clinical benefits in term of response and survival, warranting further evaluation.",exclusion,No comparator,,

A mouse model of brain metastases demonstrated high penetration and retention of SN‐38 in CNS lesions, resulting in decreased size of CNS lesions and improved survival at concentrations clinically achieved at the recommended dose of EP in patients (pts) (Adkins et al, BMC Cancer 2015). A previous phase 3 trial comparing single‐agent EP to treatment of physician's choice (TPC) was conducted in 852 pts with advanced breast cancer (BC) (Perez et al, Lancet Oncol 2015). Although the primary efficacy endpoint of improved survival was not met (HR 0.087; p value = 0.08), a subset of 67 pts who entered the study with stable brain metastases demonstrated improved overall survival (HR 0.51 [95% CI 0304 ‐ 0.858]; p < 0.01). A phase 3 trial has therefore been designed for this population of high unmet medical need. Trial Design: Pts with MBC with stable brain metastases will be randomized 1:1 to receive either single‐agent EP or TPC in an open‐label, randomized, multicenter Phase 3 study. Key Entry Criteria: Adults, with ECOG PS 0 or 1 with adequate liver, kidney and marrow function. All pts must have received prior therapy with an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine (ATC) (these drugs may have been administered in the neo/adjuvant or locally advanced/metastatic setting); pts must have had 1 prior cytotoxic regimen for MBC (triple negative BC); 2 prior cytotoxic regimens and 1 prior hormone therapy (hormone‐receptor+ BC); or 2 prior cytotoxic regimens and 1 prior HER2‐targeted therapy (HER2+ BC). Pts are required to have undergone definitive local therapy of brain metastases (either whole brain radiation; stereotactic radiation or surgical resection); signs and symptoms of brain metastases must be stable with steroids either unchanged or decreasing for ≥ 7 days prior to randomization. Prior toxicities must have resolved to ≤ Grade 1 (except sensory neuropathy ≤ Grade 2 and complete resolution of prior diarrhea). Methods: Primary efficacy endpoint is OS. Key secondary endpoints: ORR by RECIST v1.1, clinical benefit rate (ORR+SD ≥ 6 months), PFS by RANO‐BM and QoL. EP is given IV at 145 mg/m2 over 90‐min every 21 days without premedications. Pts randomized to TPC must receive 1 of the following: eribulin, ixabepilone, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel or nab‐paclitaxel (the agent must be available at the treating institution). Pts are stratified by region, ECOG PS and receptor status (TNBC, HER2+ or HR+/HER2‐). Target Accrual: ∼350 pts will be randomized to obtain the number of deaths required at 90% power to detect a statistically significant improvement in OS; 1 interim analysis will occur when 50% of the deaths are reported (130 events). PK sampling is performed in a subset of pts; UGT1A1 testing will occur in pts randomized to EP. Plasma ctDNA will be assessed at baseline for potential predictive markers of efficacy.

Material and methods Eligible patients had unresectable liver metastases. Sorafenib dose was escalated in 2 strata: I - SBRT: effective liver volume irradiated (Veff) < 80% (30-60 Gy in 6 fractions); II - WLRT: Veff > 80% (21.6 Gy in 6 fractions). Four weeks of sorafenib, with radiotherapy during weeks 2-3, was delivered at 3 escalating dose levels (200-400 mg twice daily). Dose limiting toxicity was defined as any grade 3+ liver toxicity, or grade 4+ treatment-related toxicity. Results Thirty-three patients were treated: 18 in stratum I (median dose 42 Gy), 15 in stratum II. The MTD was not reached. Grade 3+ toxicity was seen in 33% of patients, at a median of 10 days. Two deaths from non-classic liver toxicity occurred post WLRT in stratum II. The median overall survival was 22.3 and 5.7 months for strata I and II respectively. Conclusions Sorafenib and 21.6 Gy in 6 fraction WLRT resulted in unacceptably high rates of liver toxicity. Although sorafenib combined with SBRT was tolerable, the observed efficacy does not merit further clinical evaluation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",exclusion,Wrong comparator,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2017.01.018

Stereotactic, magnetic resonance (MR)-guided online-adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) may improve SBRT's therapeutic ratio. This prospective Phase I trial assessed feasibility and potential advantages of SMART to treat abdominal malignancies. MATERIALS/METHODS: Twenty patients with oligometastatic or unresectable primary liver (n = 10) and non-liver (n = 10) abdominal malignancies underwent SMART. Initial plans prescribed 50 Gy/5 fractions (BED 100 Gy) with goal 95% PTV coverage by 95% of prescription, subject to hard OAR constraints. Daily real-time online-adaptive plans were created as needed, based on daily setup MR-image-set tumor/OAR ""anatomy-of-the-day"" to preserve hard OAR constraints, escalate PTV dose, or both. Treatment times, patient outcomes, and dosimetric comparisons between initial and adaptive plans were prospectively recorded. RESULTS: Online adaptive plans were created at time of treatment for 81/97 fractions, due to initial plan violation of OAR constraints (61/97) or observed opportunity for PTV dose escalation (20/97). Plan adaptation increased PTV coverage in 64/97 fractions. Zero Grade ≥ 3 acute (<6 months) treatment-related toxicities were observed. DISCUSSION: SMART is clinically deliverable and safe, allowing PTV dose escalation and/or simultaneous OAR sparing compared to non-adaptive abdominal SBRT.",exclusion,Other study design,,10.1016/j.radonc.2017.11.032

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is well-tolerated and a valuable alternative for patients who are not eligible for invasive procedures. Yet, like all radiation therapy (RT) techniques, the energy dose deposit to tumor cells is limited by the surrounding healthy tissues. NBTXR3, composed of hafnium oxide nanoparticles, was designed to effectively absorb ionizing radiation and augment the dose deposit within the tumor cells only when activated by RT, thereby increasing tumor-specific physical killing through DNA damage/cell destruction and enhancing the immunogenic tumor cell death. Material and Methods Patients suffering from primary HCC (with/without portal vein tumor thrombosis) or liver mets were included and treated with a single intralesional injection (IL) of NBTXR3 followed by SBRT (45 Gy/3 fractions/5 to 7 days). The phase I part of the study was designed as a 3 + 3 escalation dose with tested dose levels at 10%, 15%, 22% and 33% of baseline tumor volume. Primary endpoints include the determination of the recommended dose and incidence of early dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). Secondary endpoints include assessment of global safety profile, characterization of the body kinetic profile, liver function evaluated by Child-Pugh score (CPS), AST to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), and response rate (mRECIST/RECIST v1.1). Results The enrollment is complete in the first 3 dose levels: 10% (6 pts), 15% (4 pts) and 22% (4 pts) and is ongoing at the last IL dose level at 33% with no early DLTs, no AE related to NBTXR3, and no serious AE related to RT or the injection. So far, four AEs related to the IL were observed (Malaise, grade 2; two Abdominal pain, grade 3 and Bilateral pleural effusion, grade 1) at dose level 10%, 15% and 22% respectively. NBTXR3 remained localized within the tumor, validating the relevance of the single IL. No relevant change in CPS or APRI was observed over time which is consistent with the low toxicity observed. In 7 HCC pts evaluable for response, the mRECIST assessment by MRI on target lesions resulted in the following best observed response: 3 complete responses, 3 partial responses and 1 stable disease. In 5 evaluable liver mets pts, the RECIST v1.1 assessment by MRI on target lesions resulted in the following best observed response: 1 partial response, 3 stable disease and 1 local progressive disease. Conclusion NBTXR3 was well tolerated and showed a promising safety profile. Recruitment at the highest dose level of 33% is ongoing for the IL part and, once completed, will be followed by the expansion phase.

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a well-tolerated alternative for inoperable patients (pts), yet maximal dose to the tumor is limited by potential toxicity to surrounding healthy tissues. Otherwise inert, NBTXR3 (hafnium oxide nanoparticles) when activated by ionizing radiation (RT) augments dose deposit within tumor cells, increasing tumor cell death compared to RT alone. A phase I/II clinical trial is underway to evaluate NBTXR3 activated by SBRT in pts with HCC or liver mets [NCT02721056]. Method(s): A 3+3 dose escalation was utilized in the phase I. Pts received a single intralesional injection (ILI) of NBTXR3 followed by SBRT (45 Gy/3 fractions/5-7 days), with tested NBTXR3 dose levels of 10, 15, 22 and 33% of baseline tumor volume. Primary endpoints included recommended phase II dose(s) identification and DLT. Secondary endpoints included global safety profile assessment, liver function by Child-Pugh score (CPS), AST to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), and response rate (mRECIST/ RECIST v1.1). Result(s): Four dose escalation levels are finalized (n=17): 6 pts at 10% (2 SBRT doses tested due to organ constraints), 4 pts at 15 and 22% (due to fiducial displacement and ILI site shift) and 3 pts at 33%. No NBTXR3 related DLTs were observed. Related AEs observed: one malaise (G2, 10%); 2 abdominal pain, (G3, 15%); one bilateral pleural effusion (G1, 22%), one bile duct stenosis (G3, 22%) with associated disease recurrence and SBRT; one fatigue (G1, 33%). There were no clinically meaningful changes to CPS or APRI and CT-scan demonstrated absence of NBTXR3 in surrounding healthy tissues. In 7 evaluable HCC pts, best mRECIST target lesion responses were: 3 CR, 4 PR. In 5 evaluable mets pts, best target lesion responses were: 2 PR, 1 SD, 2 PD. Conclusion(s): NBTXR3 was well tolerated and showed preliminary anti-tumor activity, supporting a protocol amendment to evaluate an additional NBTXR3 dose level (42%).

We completed a phase 2 study of individualized SBRT, utilizing pre-and during-treatment indocyanine green (ICG) clearance to adapt treatment and maximize both safety and efficacy. Method(s): From 5/10-10/14, pts with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or metastases (mets) were enrolled and underwent SBRT planning up to a target dose of 50-60 Gy or as limited by a 15% normal tissue complication probability for radiation-induced liver disease (RILD). ICG retention at 15 minutes (ICGR15) was measured prior to and 1 month after 3 of 5 planned treatments. Using a Bayesian adaptive model, RT dose was scaled down as necessary for the final 2 treatments to keep ICGR15 < 44% after the full treatment and thus minimize toxicity. Follow up was every 3 months for 2 years. Result(s): 90 pts received SBRT to 116 tumors and had at least 1 year of potential follow up. Median age was 62 years, range 34-85. 69 had HCC, 4 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and 17 mets. 62 had cirrhosis, most commonly HCV and alcoholic. Median Child-Pugh (CP) score was 6, range 5-9. 20 pts were CP B/C. Median pre-RT ICGR15 was 22, range 4-75, normal 4-10. Pts had a median of 1.5 (range 0-6) prior liver-directed therapies, most commonly transarterial chemoembolization (70), prior RT (36), and radiofrequency ablation (13). Median tumor size was 3 cm, and 12 had portal vein involvement. 63 received all 5 fractions (48 full dose, 15 with dose reduction due to elevated ICGR15); 27 received only 3 treatments. Median prescription dose was 47 Gy.

In patients with a limited number of progressing lesions, local ablation therapy (LAT) of progressive lesions followed by re-initiation of TKI has shown promise in retrospective studies but to date this strategy has not been testing in prospective fashion. Method(s): As part of an IRB approved open label prospective phase II trial (NCT01573702), patients with EGFR mutated NSCLC and immediate progression on a TKI in < 5 locations were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to progressing lesions followed by re-initiation of erlotinib. Our primary endpoint is PFS, and we hypothesize that it will be at least 3 months. Result(s): 25/40 planned patients have been enrolled and data is available on 23. By local reporting, 14 had exon 19, 5 had exon 21, 1 had compound exon 18 and exon 20, 1 had compound exon 19 and EML4/ALK and 2 were unknown. 65% were female, all were non-Hispanic white, median age 62.5 (range 43-85), PS0 65.2%/PS1 34.8%, median Charlson Comorbidity Index 6, and 71.4% were never smokers. Median number of lesions treated was 1 (range 1-3). Treated lesions included lung (14), bone (6), liver (3) and brain (2). There were no G3-4 AEs to SRS. Two subjects had grade 3 rash on erlotinib. Median PFS post treatment was 5.8 months (95% CI, 2.5 to 11.3) and median OS was 2.9 years (95% CI 1.1 to 2.9). Conclusion(s): LAT resulted in a modest extension in the duration of targeted therapy, supporting retrospective data in this population.

We report a phase II trial of ipilimumab with concurrent or sequential stereotactic ablative radiotherapy to metastatic lesions in the liver or lung (NCT02239900). Ipilimumab (every 3 weeks for 4 doses) was given with radiotherapy begun during the first dose (concurrent) or 1 week after the second dose (sequential) and delivered as 50 Gy in 4 fractions or 60 Gy in 10 fractions to metastatic liver or lung lesions. In total, 106 patients received ≥1 cycle of ipilimumab with radiation. Median follow-up was 10.5 months. Median progression-free survival time was 2.9 months (95% confidence interval, 2.45-3.40), and median overall survival time was not reached.

In selected patients with oligometastatic disease confined to liver, surgical resection improves overall survival (OS). Approximately 70-90% of liver metastases, however, are unresectable and a safe and effective alternative therapeutic option is necessary for these patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term outcomes of SBRT for unresectable liver metastases and to analyze prognostic factors affecting OS of these selected oligometastatic patients. Material and Methods Patients with 1 to 3 unresectable liver metastases, with maximum individual tumor diameters less than 6 cm and a Karnofsky Performance Status of at least 70, were enrolled and treated by SBRT on a phase 2 clinical trial. Dose prescription was 75 Gy on 3 consecutive fractions. SBRT was delivered using the volumetric modulated arc therapy by RapidArc (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) technique. Primary end point was in field local control (LC), secondary end points were overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS) and toxicity. Results Between February 2010 and September 2011, a total of 61 patients with 76 lesions were enrolled in this phase II trial, with a median follow-up time of 1.9 years. One-, threeand five- years LC rates were 94%, 78% and 78 %, respectively, with a median LC of 1.7 years. Median OS was 2.3 years and the survival rates were 83%, 30% and 21% at 1, 3 and 5 years, respectively. Univariate analysis showed two independent positive prognostic factors affecting survival: female sex (p = 0.012) and primary tumour (p = 0.001). Toxicity was moderate. One patient experienced G3 late chest wall pain, which resolved within 1 year from SBRT. No cases of RILD were detected. Conclusion Long-term results of this Phase II study suggest the efficacy and safety of SBRT for unresectable liver metastases at 5 years of follow-up. Selection of cases with positive prognostic factors may improve long-term survival of these oligometastastic patients and may confirm the role of SBRT as an effective alternative local therapy for liver metastases.",exclusion,No comparator,,

Nonetheless, objective responses and long-term results for ablation in large tumors (i.e. those >3 cm) are suboptimal. This pilot phase II trial studies combination transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) for BCLC A patients with HCC from 4 to 7 cm. Method(s): Patients were eligible if they were BCLC A, Child-Pugh score <=7, had a single HCC from 4 to 7 cm, no evidence of macrovascular invasion, no evidence of metastatic disease, ECOG 0, and were not suitable for resection or liver transplantation. Treatment consisted of drug-eluting bead (DEB)-TACE at time 0 and 1 month followed by SBRT completed within 2-3 weeks following TACE. Each DEB-TACE treatment utilized 1 vial of 100-300 micron LC Beads (BTG) loaded with 50 mg of doxorubicin. SBRT was delivered from 35 to 50 Gy in 5 fractions. The primary end-point of the study was best objective response by mRECIST (measured 1 month post-treatment and every 3 months thereafter). Secondary endpoints were progression free survival (PFS), cancer specific survival (CSS), overall survival (OS) assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): From 2014 to 2017, 20 patients were enrolled in a single institution with a median follow of 13 months (range 1-30). Baseline patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. Every patient completed the protocol as planned except one who only received DEB-TACEx1 before SBRT.19 patients had at least one post treatment scan to assess mRECIST response (one patient lost to follow up). Best objective response in the target lesion was 95%: 74% complete response (n = 14), 21% partial response (n = 4), 0%stable disease, and 5% progression of disease (n = 1). PFS at 1 year was 66%, CSS at 1 year was 88%, and OS at 1 year was 69%.

We evaluated the ability of ceramide, a bioactive sphingolipid, to predict tumour sensitivity in patients treated by hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) combined with irinotecan chemotherapy. Materials and methods Plasma levels of total ceramide and of its subspecies were measured before and during treatment in 35 patients with liver and lung oligometastases of colorectal cancer included in a phase II trial. Cer levels were quantified by LC-ESI-MS/MS and compared to tumour volume response evaluated one year later by CT-scan. Results Pretreatment plasma ceramide levels were not indicative of tumour response. Nevertheless, the levels of total ceramide and of its 4 main subspecies were significantly higher at days 3 and 10 of treatment in objective responders than in non-responders. According to Kaplan-Meier curves, almost complete tumour control was achieved at 1 year in patients with increased total ceramide levels whereas 50% of patients with decreased levels experienced an increase in tumour volume. Conclusions Total plasma ceramide is a promising biomarker of tumour response to SBRT combined with irinotecan that should enable to segregate patients with high risk of tumour escape.Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

Aim of the present study was to analyze outcome of oligometastatic CRC patients treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), and to evaluate predictive factors of survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included patients with maximum 5 metastases. Previous/concomitant systemic treatments were allowed. End points of the present study were the outcome in terms of Local control of treated metastases (LC), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: 437 metastases were treated in 270 patients. Lung was site of metastases in 48.5% of cases, followed by liver (36.4%). Systemic treatment was administered before SBRT in 199 patients (73.7%). Median follow-up time was 23 months (3-98.7). Rates of LC at 1, 3 and 5 years were 95%, 73% and 73%, respectively. Time from diagnosis of metastases to SBRT was the only factor predictive of LC (HR 1.62, p = 0.023). Median PFS was 8.6 months.

Estimations of survival and risk of treatment-related deterioration in quality of life (QOL) are important when deciding on treatment. Although we know of several prognostic factors for LC patients with BMs, the role of QOL has not been established. Authors of this study set out to evaluate changes in QOL following Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for BMs in LC patients and QOL as a prognostic factor for survival. METHODS Forty-four of 48 consecutive LC patients with BMs underwent GKS in the period from May 2010 to September 2011, and their QOL was prospectively assessed before and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after GKS by using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-BR) questionnaire. A mixed linear regression model was used to identify potential predictive factors for QOL and to assess the effect of GKS and the disease course on QOL at follow-up. RESULTS Mean QOL as measured by the brain cancer subscale (BRCS) of the FACT-BR remained stable from baseline (score 53.0) up to 12 months post-GKS (57.1; p = 0.624). The BRCS score improved for 32 patients (72.3%) with a total BM volume ≤ 5 cm(3). Mean improvement in these patients was 0.45 points each month of follow-up, compared to a decline of 0.50 points each month despite GKS treatment in patients with BM volumes > 5 cm(3) (p = 0.04). Asymptomatic BMs (p = 0.01), a lower recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) classification (p = 0.04), and a higher Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score (p < 0.01) at baseline were predictors for a high, stable QOL after GKS. After multivariate analysis, a high KPS score (p < 0.01) remained the only positive predictor of a high, stable QOL post-GKS. Median survival post-GKS was 5.6 months (95% CI 1.0-10.3). A higher BRCS score (p = 0.01), higher KPS score (p = 0.01), female sex (p = 0.01), and the absence of liver (p = 0.02), adrenal (p = 0.02), and bone metastases (p = 0.03) predicted longer survival in unadjusted models. However, in multivariate analyses, a higher BRCS score (p < 0.01), female sex (p = 0.01), and the absence of bone metastases (p = 0.02) at GKS remained significant predictors. Finally, the BRCS score's predictive value for survival was compared with the values for the variables behind well-known prognostic indices: age, KPS score, extracranial disease status, and number and volume of BMs. Both BRCS score (p = 0.01) and BM volume (p = 0.05) remained significant predictors for survival in the final model. CONCLUSIONS Patient-reported QOL according to the BRCS is a predictor of survival in patients with BMs and may be helpful in deciding on the optimal treatment. Gamma Knife surgery is a safe and effective therapeutic modality that improves QOL for LC patients with a BM volume ≤ 5 cm(3) at treatment. Careful follow-up and salvage therapy on demand seem to prevent worsening of QOL due to relapse of BMs.",exclusion,"Wrong patients, no comparator",,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2014.11.028

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed 96 patients treated with SBRT for primary (53%) or metastatic (47%) liver tumors between March 2006 and November 2013. The central HB tract (cHBT) was defined by a 15-mm expansion of the portal vein from the splenic confluence to the first bifurcation of left and right portal veins. Patients were censored for toxicity upon local progression or additional liver-directed therapy. HB toxicities were graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. To compare different SBRT fractionations, doses were converted to biologically effective doses (BED) by using the standard linear quadratic model α/β = 10 (BED10). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 12.7 months after SBRT. Median BED10 was 85.5 Gy (range: 37.5-151.2). The median number of fractions was 5 (range: 1-5), with 51 patients (53.1%) receiving 5 fractions and 29 patients (30.2%) receiving 3 fractions. In total, there were 23 (24.0%) grade 2+ and 18 (18.8%) grade 3+ HB toxicities. Nondosimetric factors predictive of grade 3+ HB toxicity included cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) histology (P<.0001), primary liver tumor (P=.0087), and biliary stent (P<.0001). Dosimetric parameters most predictive of grade 3+ HB toxicity were volume receiving above BED10 of 72 Gy (VBED1072) ≥ 21 cm(3) (relative risk [RR]: 11.6, P<.0001), VBED1066 ≥ 24 cm(3) (RR: 10.5, P<.0001), and mean BED10 (DmeanBED10) cHBT ≥14 Gy (RR: 9.2, P<.0001), with VBED1072 and VBED1066 corresponding to V40 and V37.7 for 5 fractions and V33.8 and V32.0 for 3 fractions, respectively. VBED1072 ≥ 21 cm(3), VBED1066 ≥ 24 cm(3), and DmeanBED10 cHBT ≥14 Gy were consistently predictive of grade 3+ toxicity on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: VBED1072, VBED1066, and DmeanBED10 to cHBT are associated with HB toxicity. We suggest VBED1072 < 21 cm(3) (5-fraction: V40 < 21 cm(3); 3-fraction: V33.8 < 21 cm(3)), VBED1066 < 24 cm(3) (5-fraction: V37.7 < 24 cm(3); 3-fraction: V32 < 24 cm(3)) as potential dose constraints for the cHBT when clinically indicated.",exclusion,No comparator,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients (n=222) with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver metastases, or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and Child-Pugh A liver function received 24-60 Gy of 6-fraction image-guided SBRT. Prospective QoL assessment was completed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (QLQ-C30) and/or Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary (FACT-Hep, version 4) questionnaires at baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. Ten HCC patients with Child-Pugh B liver function were also treated. RESULTS: The QLQ-C30 was available for 205 patients, and 196 completed the FACT-Hep. No difference in baseline QoL (P = .17) or overall survival (P = .088) was seen between the HCC, liver metastases, and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients. Appetite loss and fatigue measured by the QLQ-C30 clinically and statistically worsened by 1 month after treatment but recovered by 3 months. At 3 and 12 months after treatment, respectively, the FACT-Hep score had improved relative to baseline in 13%/19%, worsened in 36%/27%, and remained stable in 51%/54%. Using the QLQ-C30 Global Health score, QoL improved in 16%/23%, worsened in 34%/39%, and remained stable in 50%/38% at 3 and 12 months, respectively. Median survival was 17.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.3-19.8 months). Higher baseline scores on both FACT-Hep and QLQ-C30 Global Health were associated with improved survival. Hazard ratios for death, per 10-unit decrease in QoL, were 0.90 (95% CI 0.83-0.98; P = .001) and 0.88 (95% CI 0.82-0.95; P = .001), respectively. Tumor size was inversely correlated with survival.

To increase this tumor response, immune targeting agents can be combined with SBRT We hypothesize that the anti-PDLI agent Durvalumab will enhance immune response following SBRT targeting oligometastatic lesions. In this multicenter randomized phase II trial, we therefore propose to assess the comparative efficacy of SBRT with or without Durvalumab (MEDI4736) in oligometastatic recurrent hormone sensitive prostate cancer patients. Method(s): Patients with PCa were eligible if they had a biochemical recurrence following treatment with curative intent, with a maximum of 5 bone or lymph node metastases, seen only on FCH-PET CT or Ga-PSMA PET CT, not seen on conventional imaging assessments (bone scan or thorax, abdomen and pelvis CT scan). Main exclusion criteria are serum testosterone level < 8.5 nmol/ml, PSA doubling time less than 6 months, lung, brain, liver or other visceral metastases, any prior immune therapy. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to either SBRT + Durvalumab, or SBRT alone, with a stratification by investigation center, and number of metastases (1 vs 2-5).

This pilot study evaluates the addition of stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) following TACE in unresectable HCC patients with primary endpoints of tolerability and local tumor control. Materials/Methods: Patients with a single HCC lesion 3-8 cm, 3 lesions none over 5 cm, or lesions <3 cm in unfavorable locations were eligible following at least one TACE procedure. Multidisciplinary review of post-TACE imaging deemed all patients ineligible for transplantation or surgical resection at time of enrollment. SRT was delivered within 45 days of enrollment to a dose of 45 Gy in 3 fractions utilizing image-guidance on a linear accelerator. Between 2009 and 2014, 17 patients were treated on protocol (PC, protocol cohort) and 24 patients were treated per protocol though failed to meet inclusion criteria (OPC, off protocol cohort). All OPC exclusions were due to large tumor size and/or location, medical comorbidity or history of previous malignancy. Characteristics between cohorts were compared with T-test, Wilcoxon test, or Fisher's exact test when appropriate. Median time to intrahepatic tumor progression (TTP), median survival (MS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Result(s): There were no significant differences in age, race, time to initial TACE, or total TACE procedures between the PC and OPC. Mean tumor size in the PC was 4.6 cm and in the OPC was 5.1 cm (P = 0.652). Median intervals between TACE and SRT completions were 69.5 days and 89 days for the PC and the OPC (P = 0.063). No patient experienced > grade 2 acute toxicity. Intrahepatic recurrences occurred in 7/17 (41.2%) PC patients and 6/24 (25%) OPC patients (P = 0.273) with 2 and 4 in-field recurrences, respectively. TTP was 30 months among the PC and was not reached among the OPC (P = 0.391). No patient had isolated distant metastasis at time of first recurrence. OS for the PC and the OPC was 82.3% and 29.2%, respectively, with a median follow-up of 27.7 and 20.1 months. MS was 28.9 months for the OPC and was not reached for the PC (P = 0.046). A total of 7 patientsd3 in the PC (17.7%) and 4 in the OPC (16.7%)dwere successfully down-staged for curative liver transplantation with no evidence of active tumor at the SRT site on explant pathology. Conclusion(s): Combination of TACE followed by SRT is well-tolerated and demonstrates excellent local tumor control and MS as compared to our institution's historical outcomes with TACE alone. This held true among both highly-selected patients as well as those with suboptimal performance statuses and tumor sizes, with a substantial number of patients treated both on and off protocol successfully down-staged for curative transplantation. TACE followed by SRT as definitive therapy for unresectable HCC merits further investigation in larger clinical trials.",exclusion,No comparator,SBRT+TACE,10.1016/j.radonc.2018.09.011

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was undertaken to measure the acute changes in QoL after SABR. Patients with 1-3 treated LM were eligible. Doses of 30-60 Gy in 3-5 fractions were delivered. Prospective QoL was measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires, Core 15 for Palliative Care (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL) and liver metastases (LM21), at baseline, 1st week and last day of treatment, then 1, 6 and 12 weeks after SABR. The functional living index-emesis (FLIE) was collected at baseline, 1st week, last day and 1 week after treatment. Univariable and multivariable linear mixed modeling were performed as appropriate to assess changes in QoL over time. RESULTS: Sixty patients were included. The most common primary cancer was colorectal (42%). The global health score measured by QLQ-C15-PAL was significantly worse at treatment completion (p = 0.001), 1 week (p = 0.003) and 6 weeks (p = 0.002) after SABR but recovered by 12 weeks (p = 0.124). Nausea and constipation were worse at treatment completion (p < 0.05) but recovered 1 week after while fatigue recovered 6 weeks post-SABR.

However, there have been no randomized controlled trials comparing SBRT with standard treatments such as RFA. The purpose of this study is to compare radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for patients with hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) smaller than 3 cm. Method(s): A Markov cohort model was developed to simulate a cohort of patients aged 60-65 years with small HCCs who had undergone either RFA or SBRT and were followed up over their remaining life expectancy. The inclusion criteria were: (i) any solitary HCC <=3 cm in diameter with <= three nodules; (ii) absence of extrahepatic metastasis or portal/hepatic vein invasion; (iii) Child-Pugh Class A or B. Twenty thousand virtual patients were randomly assigned to undergo RFA or SBRT. Result(s): Predicted life expectancy was 6.452 and 6.371 years in the RFA and SBRT groups, respectively. The probability distributions of the expected overall survival were nearly identical. The 95% confidence intervals were 6.25- 6.66 and 6.17-6.58 years for RFA and SBRT, respectively.

We have previously identified a multigene expression index for tumor radiosensitivity (RSI) with validation in multiple independent cohorts. In this study, we assessed RSI in liver metastases and assessed our clinical outcomes after SBRT based on primary histology. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients were identified from our prospective, observational protocol. The previously tested RSI 10 gene assay was run on samples and calculated using the published algorithm. An independent cohort of 33 patients with 38 liver metastases treated with SBRT was used for clinical correlation. RESULTS: A total of 372 unique metastatic liver lesions were identified for inclusion from our prospective, institutional metadata pool. The most common primary histologies for liver metastases were colorectal adenocarcinoma (n=314, 84.4%), breast adenocarcinoma (n=12, 3.2%), and pancreas neuroendocrine (n=11, 3%). There were significant differences in RSI of liver metastases based on histology. The median RSIs for liver metastases in descending order of radioresistance were gastrointestinal stromal tumor (0.57), melanoma (0.53), colorectal neuroendocrine (0.46), pancreas neuroendocrine (0.44), colorectal adenocarcinoma (0.43), breast adenocarcinoma (0.35), lung adenocarcinoma (0.31), pancreas adenocarcinoma (0.27), anal squamous cell cancer (0.22), and small intestine neuroendocrine (0.21) (P<.0001).

The primary endpoint is to test the safety of SBRT for the treatment of 2 to 4 multiple lesions in several anatomic sites in a multi-institutional setting. Because of the technical challenges inherent to treating multiple lesions as their spatial separation decreases, we present the technical requirements for NRG-BR001 and the rationale for their selection. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with controlled primary tumors of breast, non-small cell lung, or prostate are eligible if they have 2 to 4 metastases distributed among 7 extracranial anatomic locations throughout the body. Prescription and organ-at-risk doses were determined by expert consensus. Credentialing requirements include (1) irradiation of the Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core phantom with SBRT, (2) submitting image guided radiation therapy case studies, and (3) planning the benchmark. Guidelines for navigating challenging planning cases including assessing composite dose are discussed. RESULTS: Dosimetric planning to multiple lesions receiving differing doses (45-50 Gy) and fractionation (3-5) while irradiating the same organs at risk is discussed, particularly for metastases in close proximity (≤5 cm). The benchmark case was selected to demonstrate the planning tradeoffs required to satisfy protocol requirements for 2 nearby lesions. Examples of passing benchmark plans exhibited a large variability in plan conformity. DISCUSSION: NRG-BR001 was developed using expert consensus on multiple issues from the dose fractionation regimen to the minimum image guided radiation therapy guidelines.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with 58 liver metastases underwent microwave ablation guided by image fusion system that combines US with (18)FDG-PET/CT images. In 28/58 tumors, (18)FDG-PET/CT with contrast medium (PET/CECT) was used. The registration technical feasibility, registration time, rates of correct targeting, technical success at 24 h, final result at 1 year and complications were analyzed and compared between the PET/CT and PET/CECT groups. RESULTS: Registration was successfully performed in all cases with a mean time of 7.8 + 1.7 min (mean + standard deviation), (4.6 + 1.5 min for PET/CECT group versus 10.9 + 1.8 min for PET/CT group, P < 0.01). In total, 46/58 (79.3%) tumors were correctly targeted, while 3/28 (10.7%) and 9/30 (30%) were incorrectly targeted in PET/CT and PET/CECT group, respectively (P < 0.05). Complete ablation was obtained at 24 h in 70.0% of cases (n = 40 tumors), 23/28 (82.1%) in the PET/CECT group and 17/30 (56.7%) in the PET/CT group (P < 0.037). Fourteen tumors underwent local retreatment (11 ablations, 2 with resection and 1 with stereotactic body radiation therapy), while 4 tumors could not be retreated because of distant disease progression and underwent systemic therapy. Finally, 54/58 (93.1%) tumors were completely treated at 1 year. One major complication occurred, a gastrointestinal hemorrhage which required surgical repair. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous ablation of (18)FDG-PET-positive liver metastases using fusion imaging of real-time US and pre-acquired (18)FDG-PET/CT images is feasible, safe and effective.

This single-institution case series evaluates the safety and efficacy of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the management of metastatic HB. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 2008 and February 2015, RFA was used as part of multidisciplinary management for HB recurrence or metastasis in 5 children (median 5.0 years old) in an attempt to provide locoregional control and preclude additional surgery. Combined local treatments of 38 metachronous metastases included surgical metastasectomy (14 lesions: 7 lung, 7 liver), percutaneous RFA (23 lesions: 21 lung, 1 liver, 1 bone), and stereotactic radiotherapy (1 liver lesion). RESULTS: For lesions treated with RFA (median diameter 6 mm, range 3-15 mm), local control was achieved in 22/23 metastases (95.6%) with median follow-up of 30.1 months after RFA (range 18.9-65.7). Median hospitalization was 3 days (2-7), with major complications limited to 1 pneumothorax requiring temporary small-caliber chest tube. Four children remain in complete remission with median follow-up of 67 months (range 41.2-88.8) after primary tumor resection, with mean disease-free survival of 31.7 months after last local treatment. One child succumbed to rapidly progressive disease 12 months after RFA (23.9 months after primary tumor resection).

METHODS: Consecutive patients with primary (hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC] or cholangiocarcinoma [CCC]) or secondary liver cancer (LM), with intrahepatic recurrence or progression after SBRT, underwent re-SBRT in 3 to 12 fractions with a median time of 15 (range 2-66) months between treatments. RESULTS: In all, 24 patients which were previously treated with SBRT (30 lesions) were retreated with SBRT for ""in- and out-of-field"" recurrences (2nd SBRT: n = 28, 3rd SBRT: n = 2). The median follow-up after re-irradiation was 14 months. The median prescribed dose for the first SBRT was 46.5 (range 33-66 Gy, EQD2(10) = 70.5) Gy and 48 (range 27-66 Gy, EQD2(10) = 71) Gy for the re-SBRT. The median mean liver dose (D(mean, liver)) was 6 Gy (range 1-25, EQD2(2) = 7 Gy) for the first SBRT and 10 Gy (range 1-63 Gy, EQD2(2) = 9 Gy) for the re-SBRT. Of the 30 re-irradiated lesions 6 were re-irradiated in-field resulting in a median EQD2(2, maximum) of 359 (range 120-500) Gy for both treatments, with an α/β = 2 to account for liver parenchyma. Treatment was well tolerated. Two patients with stent placement before SBRT developed cholangitis 4 and 14 months after re-SBRT. There were no elevations of the serum liver parameters after re-SBRT. One patient developed a grade 3 gastrointestinal bleeding. There was no radiation induced liver disease (RILD) observed.

We created an interdisciplinary, consensus-based algorithm with specific resectability and ablatability criteria for the treatment of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). To pursue consensus, members of the multidisciplinary COLLISION and COLDFIRE trial expert panel employed the RAND appropriateness method (RAM). Statements regarding patient, disease, tumor and treatment characteristics were categorized as appropriate, equipoise or inappropriate. Patients with ECOG<=2, ASA<=3 and Charlson comorbidity index <=8 should be considered fit for curative-intent local therapy. When easily resectable and/or ablatable (stage IVa), (neo)adjuvant systemic therapy is not indicated. When requiring major hepatectomy (stage IVb), neo-adjuvant systemic therapy is appropriate for early metachronous disease and to reduce procedural risk. To downstage patients (stage IVc), downsizing induction systemic therapy and/or future remnant augmentation is advised. Disease can only be deemed permanently unsuitable for local therapy if downstaging failed (stage IVd). Liver resection remains the gold standard. Thermal ablation is reserved for unresectable CRLM, deep-seated resectable CRLM and can be considered when patients are in poor health. Irreversible electroporation and stereotactic body radiotherapy can be considered for unresectable perihilar and perivascular CRLM 0-5cm. This consensus document provides per-patient and per-tumor resectability and ablatability criteria for the treatment of CRLM. These criteria are intended to aid tumor board discussions, improve consistency when designing prospective trials and advance intersociety communications. Areas where consensus is lacking warrant future comparative studies.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.",exclusion,Other study,,

Materials/Methods: Sixty patients were enrolled in the Phase 2 trial: 39 CPC-A patients with 46 lesions receiving 48 Gy in 3 fractions and 21 CPCB patients with 27 lesions treated to 40 Gy in 5 fractions. Eighty-seven percent of patients had T1N0 disease, 8% had portal vein thrombosis/ invasion, and 8% had received previous therapy for HCC. Median gross tumor volume was 34.0 cm3 (2.0-107.3). Median follow-up for the entire series was 37.8 months (3.9-75.7); 42 months (8.0-72.1) for CPC-A and 22.9 months (3.9-75.7) for the CPC-B patients, respectively. Demographics, clinical variables, treatment related toxicities within 90 days of end of treatment, and local control at 6 months were tabulated. Modified RECIST was used to determine local failure. Progression-free survival (PFS), time to local progression (TTLP), and overall survival (OS) estimates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. We analyzed potential clinical and dosimetric predictors for LC, time to local progression (TTLP), OS and PFS. Eight patients underwent orthotopic liver transplantations (OLT): 5 CPC-A and 3 CPC-B. Result(s): Six-month LC was 91% for the 50/55 patients with minimum f/u of 6 months. Eight patients experienced local progression: 5 CPC-A and 3 CPC-B. We did not find any statistically significant predictors of local control at 6 months, time to local progression by univariate analysis or PFS by multivariate analysis (MVA). Median, 1, 2 and 3-year PFS for CPC-A patients was 33.3 months, 74.3%, 60.8%, 45.8% vs 16.95 months, 55.7%, 35.1% and 11.1% in CPC-B patients (P = .092). Child-Pugh Class, gross tumor volume, and salvage OLT were found statistically significant for overall survival in the MVA. Grade >=3 toxicity as per Common Toxicity Criteria Version 3.0: thrombocytopenia 2 and 6 CBC-A and CPC-B patients respectively; abnormal liver enzymes in 3 and 6 CBC-A and CPC-B patients, respectively. Twenty-eight patients have died: 16 CPC-A and 12 CPC-B. Median survival time (MST) was 51.1 months for CPC-A (34.00, NE) and 21.75 months for CPC-B patients (10.45, 31.37). One, 2 and 3- year OS was 94.8%, 81.3% and 62.5% for CPC-A patients and 65.2%, 42.8% and 21.4% for CPC-B patients (P=.0061). Six CPC-A and 5 CPCB patients died from progression of liver cirrhosis, 5 CPC-A and 3 CPC-B patients died from progression/metastatic disease, and the remaining patients from other causes.

METHODS: Robotic SBRT was applied to oligometastatic CRC patients, defined as having 1-4 liver metastases and absent or controlled extrahepatic disease. The intended prescription dose was 37.5 Gy in three fractions. Treatment efficacy was estimated by clinical benefit rate (CBR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Toxicity was graded according to CTC-AE scale, v. 4.03. Regression analysis was performed to search for the presence of any predictive factors. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2017, 38 patients (66 lesions) were irradiated. The median delivered biological effective maximum dose (maxBED(10)) was 142 Gy. At a median follow-up of 11.8 months (range 3.2-58.8), the 1- and 2-year OS were 67.3% and 44.1%, respectively. Actuarial LC rates for all patients at 6 and 12 months were 64.2% and 60.4%, respectively. Local or distant progression occurred in 28 (77.8%) patients, with a 1- and 2-year PFS of 19.3% and 12.2%, respectively. The CBR was 71.4%, with no significant association with maxBED(10). At multivariate analysis, the presence of extrahepatic disease had a detrimental impact on PFS (HR 3.98, 95% CI 1.77-8.93; p < 0.001) and OS (HR 3.58, 95% CI 1.06-12.07; p < 0.04).

Renal cell carcinoma is the most common kidney cancer and it can metastasize. Our aim was to analyze patients treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy of renal cell carcinoma metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 58 patients (73 lesions) were treated from 2004 to 2016. Patients were candidates for analysis if a maximum of 3 metastases were diagnosed and the primary tumor was resected. Toxicity was classified according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3. RESULTS: All patients had renal cell carcinoma, in particular the clear cell type in 82.7%. A total of 39 metastases (53.4%) were located in the lungs and 19 (26%) were in the lymph nodes. Less common were metastases to bone (9.5% of cases), the liver (4.1%) and the adrenal gland (6.8%). Median followup was 16.1 months (range 3.5 to 157.1). The local control rate at 12 and 18 months was 90.2% and 90.2%, respectively. The progression-free survival rate at 12 and 18 months was 46.2% (95% CI 32.2-59) and 35% (95% CI 21.4-48.9), respectively. On univariate and multivariable analyses metachronous and single metastases predicted better progression-free survival. Systemic therapy before stereotactic body radiation therapy predicted improved local control in clear cell cases.

AIMS: (1) The aim of this study is to assess the local response of the liver lesions poststereotactic body radiation therapy regarding number and size of lesions and (2) to evaluate the toxicity to organ (s) at risk. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 15 patients were enrolled in this study from November 2014 to October 2015. The inclusion criteria for this study were patients having 1-3 liver metastasis from any solid tumor except germ cell tumor or lymphoma with no evidence of progressive disease (PD) outside the liver. A planning four dimensional-computed tomography (CT) scan was taken. Planning target volume was generated by giving margin of 5 mm. Dose prescribed was 36 Gy in 3#. Response was defined by CT abdomen done at 3 and 6 months poststereotactic body radiation therapy as per RECIST guideline (v1.1). RESULTS: At 3 months poststereotactic body radiation therapy, five patients had partial response, five patients had stable disease, and five patients had PD as per RECIST criteria. Out of 20 assessable lesions, 16 were controlled at 3 months poststereotactic body radiation therapy. The actuarial local control rate was 86% at 3 months and 77% at 6 months poststereotactic body radiation therapy. The median progression free survival was 7 months. Two patients experienced Grade 2 gastric toxicity and one patient experienced Grade 2 small bowel toxicity. No cases of radiation-induced liver disease were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This trial examines the feasibility of stereotactic body radiotherapy to liver metastasis in the Indian scenario.

Local treatments for oligometastatic patients may have significant role since a large majority of patients treated with systemic chemotherapy experience progression mostly in initial sites of tumor burden rather than new sites of progression. Surgical excision of metastatic sites usually from liver and lung that have been shown to prolong survival in colorectal cancer, sarcomas, melanoma, breast cancer and many other tumor types. Currently surgery is considered to be standard approach for these groups of patients. Surgical series of hepatic metastasectomy of primary colorectal cancer resulted 18-51 % 5-year survival rate with 2-7% operative mortality and 6-13 % serious morbidity risk. Most of the metastasectomy data are based on single institutional series and had many confounding factors such as patient selection that cause some doubts about the results. It should also be considered that many tumors are inoperable due to tumor location or medical inoperability of the patient. Stereotactic treatment was developed by a neurosurgeon Lars Leksell to treat inoperable deeply seated lesions in the brain. SABR recently become popular to extra-cranial sites with technological improvements. Its strengths include high rates of tumor eradication via non-invasive, convenient, short outpatient treatment course, favorable toxicity and no recovery time. It yielded very good results for treatment of primary and metastatic tumors in various body sites in properly selected patients. However despite potential advantages, there are few published retrospective or phase II studies with limited patient number. These studies about metastatic liver disease that have been treated with SABR yielded 70-82 % 2-year local control rate without any serious toxicity. So there is great hope that SABR may find prominent place in treatment of metastatic cancer. There are also few literature data with favorable results on lung, adrenal, lymph node metastasis treated with SABR. There is no randomized study comparing efficacy and toxicity of surgery and SABR in oligometastatic setting. Many authors consider surgery as the standard treatment for local management of metastatic sites. However, SABR is promising approach as a complementary or alternative regimen to surgery. Until well-designed randomized studies comparing these two regimens, selection of treatment should be individualized to the patient with the guidance of available data. Individualization of treatment is dependent on patient factors and metastatic sites. Performance status, comorbidities of the patient, location and number of metastatic sites, previous treatments, underlying prognosis, tumor biology and experience of the team are all important factors for consideration of local treatment.",exclusion,Review,Interesting as a review,10.1007/s00432-019-02943-x

Although surgery is the only treatment with proven efficacy for IVC-TT, the surgical management of advanced IVCTT is difficult and offers poor survival outcomes. Furthermore, about 50% of these patients develop recurrent metastatic disease within a year. Stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SAbR) was shown to be effective for RCC with favorable response rates reported for SAbR when directed at portal or IVC-TT in the setting of hepatocellular carcinoma. We report the results from the safety lead-in phase of an ongoing phase II trial designed to evaluate the effect of neo-adjuvant SAbR for IVC-TT on the 1-year recurrence-free survival of RCC patients. METHOD(S): Newly diagnosed Patients with RCC and IVC-TT received 40Gy in 5 fractions of neo-adjuvant SAbR to the IVC-TT, followed by radical nephrectomy and thrombectomy. Primary endpoints for the safety lead-in phase were feasibility and safety defined as absence of grade 4-5 adverse events within 90 days of surgery. RESULT(S): The characteristics of the 6 IVC-TT patients enrolled in this trial and relative tumors with Novick level II-III IVCTT are summarized in table 1. One additional patient was withdrawn from the trial because of extensive liver metastasis found during surgery which was subsequently aborted. SAbR was administered over 9-16 days, seven immediate adverse events (grade 1-2) were reported in 4 patients during or after SAbR. Surgery was performed within 4-14 days from the completion of SAbR. The estimated blood loss range was 10-1200cc and 3 patients received blood transfusions. No intraoperative complications were reported. Length of hospital stay after surgery was 3-10 days. No readmissions or mortality related to surgery were observed. Overall, 56 post-operative adverse events were reported within 90 days (table 1), none of which were greater than grade 3; of those, 23 (41%) and 7 (12%) were considered to be related to surgery or SAbR, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Our initial results indicate that neo-adjuvant SAbR followed by nephrectomy and tumor thrombectomy for IVC-TT is feasible and safe.

In this study we aim to assess the efficacy of SBRT in comparison to sorafenib treatment in patients with advanced HCC. Material(s) and Method(s): We included 901 patients treated with sorafenib at six tertiary centers in Europe and Asia and 122 patients treated with SBRT from thirteen centers in Germany and Switzerland. Medical records were reviewed including laboratory parameters and treatment characteristics. Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Result(s): Median OS of SBRT patients was 18.1 [10.3 - 25.9] months compared to 8.8 [8.2 - 9.5] months in patients treated with sorafenib. After adjusting for different baseline characteristics, the survival benefit for patients treated with SBRT was still preserved with a median OS of 17.0 [10.8 - 23.2] months compared to 9.6 [8.6 - 10.7] months in patients treated with sorafenib. SBRT of intrahepatic lesions in patients with extrahepatic metastases was also associated with improved OS compared to patients treated with sorafenib in the same setting (17.0 vs 10.0 months, p=0.012) whereas in patients with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) there was no survival benefit in patients with SBRT.

The term oligometastasis describes an intermediate state of cancer spread between localized disease and widespread metastasis. The implication of such an intermediate state is that the disease can be cured by using metastasis‐directed therapy. Historically, in some patients with oligometastases in the liver or lungs, surgical resection was often indicated, as abundant evidence suggested it could improve progression‐free or overall survival. Recently, several studies have reported promising outcomes of >80% local control with Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) in patients with lung or liver oligometastases. Nonetheless, very few studies have focused on non‐liver, non‐lung extracranial oligometastatic lesions treated with SBRT, and such studies have limitations of a retrospective nature and small sample sizes.Because allmost studies are based on single‐arm studies without appropriate controls, the level of evidence to support SBRT is weak. Randomized trials are therefore necessary to establish the utility of SBRT for oligometastatic disease. This study is designed as a randomized phase II study.

This applies also to metastases from low grade neuroendocrine tumors (NET), either derived from gastrointestinal organs or from an unknown primary site. Here we report two cases of multiple liver metastases from low grade NET repeatedly treated by means of SBRT, achieving the outcome of long-term local control. Material(s) and Method(s): From March 2011 to September 2015 49 SBRT courses were delivered to 39 patients for liver metastases from different primaries. All courses were given by VMAT with 6 MV photons, image guided by CBCT in every fraction. Since 2013, deep inspiration breath hold was adopted in order to control organ motion. Two patient had metastases from well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors, one from an unknown primary (patient A), the other from a pancreatic primary (patient B). Patient A underwent two SBRT courses, both in 2011, the first one on segment 6 (CTV volume 25 ml, CTV dose 75 Gy, PTV 50 Gy, in 3 fractions), the second one on two adjacent metastases, respectively in segment 7 and 8 (total CTV volume 54 ml, CTV dose 60 Gy, PTV 50 Gy, in 3 fractions). Patient B received three courses, respectively in 2013, 2014 and 2015. The first SBRT was delivered on segment 6 (CTV volume 38 ml, CTV dose 50 Gy, PTvV45 Gy, in 5 fractions), the second on segment 8 (CTV volume 30 ml, CTV dose 50 Gy, PTV 45 Gy, in 5 fractions), the last on segment 4 (CTV volume 44 ml, CTV dose 50 Gy, PTV 45 Gy, in 5 fractions ). Patient A was found to be somatostatine receptor-negative, thus he was followed up mainly by serial CT scans; also, his disease status matched well to trends of two biomarkers (chromogranin A and gastrin). Patient B was followed up by alternating CT scans and PET/CT-68Ga-DOTATOC. Result(s): At last follow up patient A achieved long-term local control in S6 metastasis (45 months) as well as in S7-8 (42 months), while showing disease progression at a new liver site at 45 months after first SBRT. At last follow up patient B achieved local control in all sites (S6: 30 months; S8: 13 months; S4: 6 months) with a durable partial PET response in S8 and S4 and a complete PET response in S6. Disease progression took place in two bone sites at 30 months after first SBRT, without any concomitant liver progression. Conclusion(s): these favorable results in large volume liver metastases from low grade NET, although derived from only two anedoctal cases, give support to the concept that the outcome of SBRT is relatively independent from tumor type, being mainly mediated by an ablative effect. Also they represent a typical example showing how repeat liver SBRT may lead to a a significant delay in disease progression although without achieving a definitive cure.",exclusion,No comparator,,
random-journal.pdf,LivM204,"Kimura, T",2017,English,LIV.M:#5;LIV.P:#1,SBRT for oligometastases,"Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is commonly used to treat patients with extracranial oligometastases in clinical settings. In addition, the ""abscopal effect"", which is radiotherapy-induced immune-mediated tumor regression at sites distant to the irradiated field, and treatment with a combination of SBRT and immune checkpoint inhibitors have attracted attentions of researchers. According to an international survey of more than 1000 radiation oncologists reported by Lewis SL et al.[1], 61% of responders have been using SBRT for extracranial oligometastases, and the most commonly treated organs were the lung (90%), liver (75%) and spine (70%). Many authors have suggested that surgery for extracranial oligometastases might improve local control and overall survival. With the recent technical developments in SBRT, SBRT is also a promising modality for achieving a high rate of local control with minimal invasiveness. In this lecture, we would like to review the treatment results of SBRT for extracranial oligometastases, such as those located in the lung, liver and spine and discuss comparisons between surgery and SBRT, and cost-effectiveness. 1) SBRT for extracranial oligometastases, such as those located in the lung, liver and spine. 1. Lung Colorectal cancer (CRC) often presents with oligometastases, commonly in the lung and liver, and CRC has a high risk of local failure [2]. The accepted selection criteria include a good performance status (PS), absence of extra-pulmonary disease, control of the primary tumor, 1-5 synchronous or metachronous metastases and adequate respiratory function [3, 4]. Several authors have reported that the 2-year local control rate ranges 49- 96%. The optimal dose is recommended at least 48 Gy in three fractions to achieve greater than 90% 2-year control. 2. Liver The best candidates are patients with a good PS, controlled or absent extra-hepatic disease, <=3 hepatic lesions, size lesions <=3 cm, lesion distance from organs at risk >8 mm, good liver function (Childs A) and a healthy liver [5]. Several authors have reported that the 2-year local control rate ranged from 79- 92%. The optimal dose is recommended 48- 60 Gy in three fractions for lesions with a diameter <=3 cm, while for lesions with a diameter >3 cm a higher prescription dose, such as 60- 75 Gy is necessary to obtain similar local control [5]. 3. Spine The goal of spinal SBRT is local control and pain control. Several authors have reported that the 1-year local control rate ranges 80- 98% and provides pain relief. Therefore, several dose/fractionation schedules, such as 24 Gy in 1 fraction or 27 or 30 Gy in 3 fractions have been used and the optimal dose/fraction schedule is still unclear. 2) Comparison between surgery and SBRT for extracranial oligometastases According to several guidelines, surgery for extracranial oligometastases is still standard practice because of lack of evidence that SBRT has clinical advantages. A retrospective analysis comparing surgery with SBRT for 110 patients with pulmonary oligometastases demonstrated that 3-years overall survival rates were 62% for surgery and 60% for SBRT (p = 0.43) [6]. The authors concluded survival after surgery was not better than after SBRT although SBRT should be the second choice after surgery. However, no randomized trials have been conducted, and prospective randomized studies are required to define the effectiveness of each modality. 3) Cost-effectiveness Extracranial oligometastases have been usually managed with systemic therapy with or without surgery. However, systemic therapy, including molecular targeted drugs, is expensive. A cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov modelling approach demonstrated that video-assisted thoracic surgery wedge resection or SBRT could be costeffective in selected patients with pulmonary oligometastases [7]. Increases in medical expenses are a social problem worldwide, but it can be said that SBRT is a promising modality in this aspect.",exclusion,Review,Interesting as a review,10.4103/jcrt.JCRT_655_16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with adrenal metastases treated using SBRT from 2001 to 2014. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1 was used. Maximum tumor response was defined as the greatest percentage tumor reduction noted on two or more post-SBRT CT scans. RESULTS: We identified 44 patients (median age 61.3 years, range: 25.8-85), with 54 adrenal metastases; primary diagnoses include non-small cell lung cancer (28 patients and 38 lesions), small cell lung cancer (1 patient), hepatocellular carcinoma (6 patients), and other (9 patients). Treatment was delivered in single (16 lesions, median dose 18 Gy [14-18]) or multiple fractions (38 lesions, median dose 30 Gy [16-40]). Median planning target volume was 49.65cc (3.21-984.54). Median response at first post-SBRT follow-up (median 1.65 months (m) (0.33-5.37), n = 46 lesions) was 10.8% with 91.3% local control. Median maximum tumor response was 31.8% (n = 32 lesions) at median follow-up of 5.4 m (0.9-44.8) with 96.6% local control. The response was comparable regardless of tumor histology or treatment fractionation. No patients experienced Grade 3/4 acute toxicities. One patient with a history of naproxen use required suturing with omental patch placement for perforated pyloric ulcer 14 m post-SBRT (18 Gy in single fraction) to the right adrenal metastasis; this region received <5 Gy. Ten patients treated for pain with available follow-up obtained relief. CONCLUSIONS: SBRT is a safe and efficacious treatment for adrenal metastases, demonstrating local tumor control.

The incidence varies between 20 and 85% depending on the primary cancer. Breast, prostate, and lung cancers are responsible for 70% of bone metastases. Cancer with bone metastases compared to other metastatic sites is considered as associated with a better prognosis, particularly for breast and prostate cancer. Bone metastases may be present at diagnosis (synchronous metastasis) or appear at a later time (metachronous metastasis). The concept of ""oligometastases"" was proposed in patients with about 3 up to 5 metastases (without restriction on the primary site) and associated with an intermediate prognosis. It was hypothesized that local treatment with curative intent, aiming at the few metastatic sites, would yield long‐term survival probabilities, along with systemic therapies. Long‐term survivors have been reported after curative‐intent treatment of metastasis in sarcoma and colorectal cancers with liver or lung metastasis. We chose to focus on bone metastasis because of their high incidence, their impact on the patient's quality of life and autonomy, and their accessibility to potentially curative radiotherapy. The systemic treatment of metastatic cancer includes hormonal therapy (breast and prostate cancer), biologically‐targeted drugs and chemotherapy (all cancers). Stereotactic radiotherapy is a highly accurate technique was initially developed for performing the radiosurgery of brain tumors in patients for whom it was deemed be too difficult to proceed to classical excision surgery. In this process, a high total dose of radiation is delivered in a single fraction to a well‐defined intra‐cranial target. The concept of radiotherapy in stereotactic conditions was extended to one or several fractions delivered to small volumes primary tumors/ metastases in extra‐cranial sites (Stereotactic Body RadioTherapy [SBRT]). At present, high control rates have been achieved for lung metastases. Similarly, very high local control rates have been reported in bone metastases after stereotactic radiotherapy. In this protocol, our purpose is to demonstrate, via a randomized phase III trial, that high doses of radiotherapy, delivered in stereotactic conditions to the bone metastases (between 1 and 3 metastases) in solid tumor patients is able to improve the survival without progression.",exclusion,"Other study, wrong patients",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13246-017-0614-7

Given the range of complex anatomical targets including liver, spine and adrenals, a credentialing process was implemented based on individual centre visits combined with remote audits to ensure compliance with international bestpractice guidelines for safe and effective SABR. Method Centres wishing to participate in NIVORAD were split into two groups. Those with a previous site visit through TROG trials such as CHISEL were deemed to have had a SABR process review and verification of image guidance capabilities and dose calculation for non-spine targets. For these sites that wished to treat spinal metastases a film measurement of the benchmarking plan was required for remote review (Gamma passing rate at 2%/2 mm) to ensure correct dose gradient and MLC modelling accuracy. For centres with no previous TROG SABR participation, a site visit is performed to review SABR processes in a multi-disciplinary setting using ASTRO, AAPM and RANZCR guidelines [1-3]. A measurement of the spine benchmarking case incorporating IGRT tests is performed during the site visit. Results 11/22 centres have had a previous SABR TROG audit; one has submitted a spine measurement (gamma = 96.7%). Of the 11 remaining centres, four have had a site audit with 3 spine measurements performed (gamma = 88.1%, 95.5% and 94.9%). SABR processes in a multidisciplinary setting were reviewed with no major violations. Location/ Fig. 1 Planned and measured axial film measurements of the spine benchmarking case for the four centres with spine measurements. Gamma passing rates are presented for 2%/2 mm criteria. Dose colourwash scale is not the same for each case. The centre reference number is given at the top left corner width of cord dose gradient agreed with plan<1 mm for all measurements. Conclusion A SABR process review and measurement has been used to credential centres for treatment on the NIVORAD trial. This audit provides a thorough external review of SABR processes and an independent verification of spine SABR IGRT and delivery (Fig. 1) (Figure presented).",exclusion,Wrong intervention and comparator,,10.1016/j.adro.2018.09.001

Stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) has emerged as an alternative local therapy for nonsurgical candidates. Herein, we report the oncologic and patient‐reported quality‐of‐life (PR‐QoL) outcomes for a subset of patients with oligometastatic colorectal cancer who were treated in a prospective phase 2 multicenter clinical trial. Methods and materials: Patients with a pathologically proven diagnosis of oligometastatic colorectal cancer were enrolled as part of a prospective study. SABR dose and fractionation schedules were dependent on the lesion location and size. Patient follow‐up occurred 6 weeks after completion of SABR and at 3‐month intervals for the following 3 years. Patients received the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐General questionnaire at baseline and at each follow‐up visit to assess PR‐QoL. The total Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐General questionnaire scores were compared with those from baseline using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Overall survival, local progression‐free survival (PFS), and distant PFS were calculated using the Kaplan‐Meier estimation to the date of the last follow‐up visit/death or local/distant failure. Results: A total of 31 patients with oligometastatic colorectal cancer with 1 (71.0%), 2 (16.1%), 3 (3.2%), 4 (3.2%), or 5 (6.5%) metastatic lesions were identified. After a median follow‐up time of 50.1 months, the median OS from the time of completion of the SABR was 53.9 months (95% confidence interval, 23.2‐84.6), and the 5‐year OS, local PFS, and distant PFS were 45%, 83%, and 27%, respectively. Acute grade 2+ toxicity was 9.7% (pain, nausea, fatigue) and late grade 3+ toxicity (small bowel obstruction) was 3.2% with no significant change in PR‐QoL in the year after SABR. Conclusions: This subset analysis of a prospective phase 2 study demonstrates that SABR is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with unresectable oligometastic colorectal cancer.

We performed a randomized trial to study the impact of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) in patients presenting with metachronous oligometastases. Methods: Eligible patients had a controlled primary malignancy with 1‐5 metastatic lesions, all of which were suitable for SABR, had an ECOG performance status 0‐1, and life expectancy >6 months. Stratification was by number of metastases (1‐3 vs. 4‐5). Randomization was in a 1:2 ratio between palliative standard of care (SOC) [Arm 1] vs. SOC plus SABR to all metastatic lesions [Arm 2]. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). A randomized phase II screening design was employed with a two‐sided alpha of 0.20 (wherein a p‐value <0.20 designates a positive trial) to provide an initial comparison of the two treatment strategies. Secondary endpoints included progression‐free survival (PFS), toxicity, and QOL (assessed using the FACT‐G). Results: Between 2012‐2016, 99 patients were randomized (33 in Arm 1, 66 in Arm 2) at centres in Canada, Europe and Australia. Median age was 68 (range 43‐89) and the commonest primary tumor types were breast (n = 18), lung (n = 18), colorectal (n = 18) and prostate (n = 16). Most patients (n = 92) had 1‐3 metastases. Median follow‐up was 26 months. Median OS was 28 months in Arm 1 (95% CI 19‐33 months) vs. 41 months in Arm 2 (95% CI: 26 months to 'not reached'; stratified log‐rank p = 0.09). Median PFS was 6.0 months in Arm 1 (95% CI: 3.4‐7.1 months) vs. 12 months in Arm 2 (95% CI: 6.9‐30 months; stratified log‐rank p = 0.001). Grade ≥2 treatment related adverse events occurred in 9% in Arm 1, and 29% in Arm 2 (p = 0.026). No differences in overall FACT‐G scores were seen at 6 months (mean 82.5 vs. 82.6 respectively; p = 0.992). Rates of related grade ≥ 2 toxicity after SABR were 25% for lung lesions, 31% for bony lesions, 33% for liver and 57% for adrenals (p = 0.45). Lesional control rates after SABR ranged from 100% (in adrenals), 76% (bone), 75% (liver) and 70% (lung), p = 0.56. Conclusions: SABR for oligometastases was associated with an improvement in OS, and a doubling in PFS.

Method(s): Eighteen patients with different primary tumors: Colorectal carcinoma (9 patients), lung carcinoma and breast cancer (3 patients each) and 1 to 2 metastatic liver lesions were treated with the CyberKnife system from 2012 to mid 2015 after CT-guided implantation of 2-4 fiducial gold markers. Prescribed total dose was 45Gy (65% prescription isodose) in 3 fractions given every other day. Clinical target volume (CTV) was defined as visible gross tumor on co-registered MRI and iv-contrast-CT scans. Fiducial tracking was used for reducing planning target volume (PTV) to 4 mm added to the CTV. Ray tracing dose calculation algorithm was applied. For lesions near the diaphragm an additional MC-calculation was done to verify dose distribution. Concurrent chemotherapy was allowed. Follow up was done by CT or MRI in three monthly intervals. Result(s): 18 patients (10 females, 8 males; median age 61 years) were treated; median follow up time for surviving patients was 22.9 months. Median PTV volume was 59 cc.

METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 55 patients (70 lesions) with a median follow-up of 10 months (range 1-57) treated from 2011 to 2016. All patients had not been eligible for other local treatment options. Median age was 64 years and 64% were male. 27 patients (36 lesions) suffered from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, Child A:78%, Child B:18%, Child C:4%), 28 patients (34 lesions) had oligometastatic liver disease (MD). Treatment planning was based on 4D-CT usually after placement of fiducials. Dose and fractionation varied depending on localization and size, most commonly 3 × 12.5 Gy (prescribed to the surrounding 65%-isodose) in 56% and 5x8Gy (80% isodose) in 20% of the treated lesions. RESULTS: Local recurrence was observed in 7 patients (13%) and 8 lesions (11%), resulting in estimated 1- and 2-year local control rates (LC) of 91 and 74%.

RESULTS: Eleven patients were males, 10 patients were females, median age at diagnosis was 63 years, and colorectal cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in 18 patients. The abdomino-pelvic lymph nodes were the commonest treatment site in 11 (45.8%), average PTV volume of 46.4 cc.

We investigated cost-effectiveness of the two competing treatments of SBRT and RFA in management of unresectable hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer. Materials/Methods: We developed a multistate Markov decision model with probabilistic sensitivity analysis to simulate a randomized controlled trial for SBRT and RFA and compare respective cost effectiveness (in dollars per quality adjusted life years, or QALY). Model assumptions were based on extensive literature search of utilities and recurrence risks, including published data from our institution. Costs were taken from the 2013 Medicare reimbursement tables. In order to reflect reported patient selection variability across literature, two mortality rates due to hepatic metastases were considered for both treatment modalities: 50% probability of death in 1.5 years and 60% in 5 years. Sensitivity analysis was performed to model uncertainty in these parameters. Result(s): For patients with 5-year life expectancy, Markov cohort analysis demonstrated QALY-adjusted survival advantage of SBRT over RFA with QALY 4.35 vs. 3.89 respectively. This difference was marginal for patients with 1.5-year life expectancy. Physician-hour involvement was less in SBRT group. The incremental cost adjusted effectiveness (Cost/QALY) for SBRT over RFA was $2,379 in the 5-year life expectancy cohort, and $2,216 for SBRT over RFA in the 1.5-year cohort. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated robustness of these results across a range of utility values, costs, recurrence rates, and procedure-related morbidity. Additionally, SBRT is relatively fast outpatient procedure and required less physicianhour involvement. Conclusion(s): Compared to RFA, SBRT was more cost-effective modality for unresectable or potentially resectable hepatic metastases over a wide range of treatment and disease assumptions, including recurrence rates, and procedure-related morbidity.",exclusion,Wrong comparator,,10.1159/000490260

Materials/Methods: Patients with metastatic CRC to liver, unsuitable for surgery, treated on either a phase I study of 6 fraction SBRT (for liver metastases from any primary cancer) or a phase II study of 6 fraction SBRT for CRC liver metastases were pooled for evaluation. Eligibility criteria included ECOG performance status (PS) - 2, tumor - 15cm, life expectancy > 3 months -700ml uninvolved liver and, for phase II - 5 metastases.

The progression-free survival at 1-year and 2-year was 50% and 25%, respectively. Median overall survival was 16 months (95% confidence interval=8-24 months), with 1-year and 2-year rates of 58% and 41%, respectively. Toxicity was very low consisting mainly of grade 1 and 2 events. CONCLUSION: SBRT provides good local control for both primary and metastatic liver lesions, with minimal toxicity.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.1259/bjr.20180058

METHODS: Inclusion criteria of the present retrospective study were: (a) liver oligometastases with controlled primary tumor; (b) absence of progressive disease ≥6 months; (c) metastases ≤ 3; (d) evaluation of SBRT-response by means of 18-fludeoxyglucose-PET/CT for at least two subsequent evaluations; (e) Karnofsky performance status >80; (f) life-expectancy >6 months. The following metabolic parameters were defined semi-quantitatively for each metastases: (1) standardized uptake value (SUVmax; (2) SUV-mean; (3) metabolic tumor volume (MTV), tumor volume with a SUV ≥3, threshold 40%; (4) total lesion glycolysis (TLG), i.e. the product of SUV-mean and MTV. Local control was defined as absence of recurrence in the field of irradiation. RESULTS: 41 liver metastases were analyzed. Pre-SBRT, median SUV-max was 8.7 (range, 4.5-23.59), median SUV-mean was 4.6 (range, 3-7.5), median MTV was 5.7 cc (range, 0.9-80.6) and median total lesion glycolysis was 24.1 (range, 3.6-601.5). At statistical analysis, metastases with SUV-mean >5 (p 0.04; odds ratio 4.75, sensitivity = 50%, specificity = 82.6%, area under the curve 0.66) and SUV-max >12 (p 0.02; odds ratio 5.03, sensitivity = 69%, specificity = 70%, area under the curve = 0.69) showed higher rates of infield-failure compared to the remaining lesions. CONCLUSION: According to current findings, pre-SBRT SUV-max and SUV-mean could be predictable of local response in liver oligometastases. Advances in knowledge: Present findings could support the hypothesis that fludeoxyglucose-PET/CT may be a powerful tool to predict tumor control. Specifically, current results might be helpful for clinicians in the decision-making process regarding liver oligometastatic patient selection as well as the individual therapy stratification distinguishing between slowly local progressing patients and rapidly progressing patients.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2016.01.032

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed records of patients treated with SBRT for oligometastatic PCa. Metastasis control (ie, control of the treated lesion, MC), biochemical progression-free survival, distant progression-free survival, and overall survival were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Sixty-six men with 81 metastatic PCa lesions, 50 of which were castrate-resistant, were included in the analysis. Lesions were in bone (n=74), lymph nodes (n=6), or liver (n=1). Stereotactic body radiation therapy was delivered in 1 fraction to 71 lesions (88%), at a median dose of 16 Gy (range, 16-24 Gy). The remaining lesions received 30 Gy in 3 fractions (n=6) or 50 Gy in 5 fractions (n=4). Median follow-up was 16 months (range, 3-49 months). Estimated MC at 2 years was 82%. Biochemical progression-free survival, distant progression-free survival, and overall survival were 54%, 45%, and 83%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, only the dose of SBRT was significantly associated with MC; lesions treated with 16 Gy had 58% MC, and those treated with ≥18 Gy had 95% MC at 2 years (P≤.001). At 2 years, MC for lesions treated with 18 Gy (n=21) was 88%. No patient treated with ≥18 Gy in a single fraction or with any multifraction regimen had local failure. Six patients (9%) had grade 1 pain flare, and 2 (3%) had grade 2 pain flare. No grade 2 or greater late toxicities were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic body radiation therapy for patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer provided optimal metastasis control and acceptable toxicity with doses ≥18 Gy. Biochemical progression-free survival was 54% at 16 months with the inclusion of SBRT in the treatment regimen.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of this new radiotherapy modality in a series of oligometastatic ovarian cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical records of patients affected by oligometastatic ovarian carcinoma treated with SBRT were reviewed. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients with 44 metastatic lesions (lymph nodes, 63.6%; liver, 31.8%; and lung, 4.5%) treated with SBRT between January 2011 and May 2017 were analyzed. After a median follow-up period of 28.5 months (range, 6-86 months), 17 patients (65.4%) were still alive at time of analysis: 6 are without evidence of disease, 11 experienced a disease progression. Eight patients died of disease, 1 died because of an heart attack while being disease free. The median local control (LC) was not reached. One-, 2-, and 5-year LCs were 92.9%. Median progression-free survival was 19 months, with 1-year progression-free survival of 69.3% and 38% at 2 years, 19% at 5 years. Median overall survival was 64.5 months, with all patients alive after 1 year, 92.7% at 2 years, and 61.7% at 5 years. Five (11.3%) cases experienced G2 toxicity; most common adverse effect was nausea and vomiting (3 cases [6.8%]) followed by abdominal pain (2 cases [4.5%]).

Much of the existing literature indicates this technique is safe and convenient for patients, as compared with conventionally fractionated concurrent chemo-radiation therapy. However, there has been no direct comparison of these two treatment modalities when given in the preoperative setting. It also remains uncertain if SBRT results in similar nodal downstaging to preoperative, conventionally fractionated chemo-RT. STUDY DESIGN: This study is a prospective, open-label, randomized, parallel, two-arm, phase II clinical trial. Patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomized after a minimum of two months of induction chemotherapy. These patients will be required to have no biopsy-proven distant disease on repeat staging studies before randomization. Patients who have radiologically equivocal evidence of distant metastatic disease (small lung nodules, or liver lesions that cannot be definitively characterized, etc.) are also eligible for enrollment. Patients with biopsy-proven metastatic disease are not eligible. The total number of patients planned for accrual is approximately 102 patients (51 patients per arm).",exclusion,Wrong comparator,,

Method(s): We reviewed the clinical data of patients with inoperable HCC who underwent SBRT using Robotic arm Radiosurgery technique from September 2009 to December 2015. The clinical data was obtained from patients' case records. Data analysis was carried out using SPSS software (version 20). Survival was calculated using Kaplanmeier method. Result(s): A total of 15 patients who were treated on alternate days with SBRT using Robotic arm Radiosurgery technique in the study period were included. There were 14 male and 1 female patients.

We investigated factors associated with clinical outcomes for liver metastases treated with SBRT from a multi-center, international patient registry. METHODS: Patients with liver metastases treated with SBRT were identified in the RSSearch® Patient Registry. Patient, tumor and treatment characteristics associated with treatment outcomes were assessed. Dose fractionations were normalized to BED(10). Overall survival (OS) and local control (LC) were evaluated using Kaplan Meier analysis and log-rank test. RESULTS: The study included 427 patients with 568 liver metastases from 25 academic and community-based centers. Median age was 67 years (31-91 years). Colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC) was the most common primary cancer. 73% of patients received prior chemotherapy. Median tumor volume was 40 cm(3) (1.6-877 cm(3)), median SBRT dose was 45 Gy (12-60 Gy) delivered in a median of 3 fractions [1-5]. At a median follow-up of 14 months (1-91 months) the median overall survival (OS) was 22 months. Median OS was greater for patients with CRC (27 mo), breast (21 mo) and gynecological (25 mo) metastases compared to lung (10 mo), other gastro-intestinal (GI) (18 mo) and pancreatic (6 mo) primaries (p < 0.0001). Smaller tumor volumes (< 40 cm(3)) correlated with improved OS (25 months vs 15 months p = 0.0014). BED(10) ≥ 100 Gy was also associated with improved OS (27 months vs 15 months p < 0.0001). Local control (LC) was evaluable in 430 liver metastases from 324 patients. Two-year LC rates was better for BED(10) ≥ 100 Gy (77.2% vs 59.6%) and the median LC was better for tumors < 40 cm(3) (52 vs 39 months). There was no difference in LC based on histology of the primary tumor. CONCLUSIONS: In a large, multi-institutional series of patients with liver metastasis treated with SBRT, reasonable LC and OS was observed. OS and LC depended on dose and tumor volume, while OS varied by primary tumor.

Inclusion criteria are: histologically proven CRC, age >=18 years old, controlled primary tumor, controlled extra-hepatic or extra-pulmonary lesions, ECOG performance status 0-1, at least one measurable lesion but less than 5, not a candidate for surgical resection. Patients who have liver metastasis undergo a percutaneous, Ultrasound-guided, fiducial marker implantations, then simulate with abdominal compression using 4-dimentional CT (4D-CT) and MRI. The gross tumor volume (GTV) is delineated in each 4D-CT phase, the internal target volume (ITV) was the envelope of GTVs from each phase of 4D-CT. The planning treatment volume (PTV) was ITV plus an isotropic margin of 3-5 mm. For patients of lung metastasis, 4D-CT simulation or simulation in DIBH are all allowed. The dose and fractionation are chosen according to the location and size of lesion. Cone-beam CT (CBCT) will be used to verify patient positioning at every treatment.

Between August 2008 and November 2012, 59 spinal metastatic lesions in 39 patients were treated with SBRT. Fourteen lesions (23.7%) were re-irradiated to treat recurrence after prior radiotherapy. Patients were treated with a median radiation dose of 27 Gy (range, 18-35 Gy) in a median of three fractions (range, one to five) using the CyberKnife Xsight Spine tracking system. Median planning target volume of the 59 spinal metastatic lesions was 37.4 cm(3) (range, 0.9-301.4 cm(3)). Radiation was prescribed to the median 80% isodose line that encompassed at least 90% of the tumor volume. The revised Tokuhashi scoring system and the Tomita scoring system were adopted to predict survival of patients. Local progression was defined as tumor progression by imaging, or if other therapy such as surgery or re-irradiation was given after SBRT, as salvage treatment. The median follow-up period was 7.4 months (range, 1.1-42.5 months). Four of 59 (6.8%) lesions experienced local progression, and all of them occurred within 1-year. Two of four local progressions occurred in re-irradiated tumors, which received 21 Gy in three fractions. With respect to treatment site-specific survival (TSS), better performance status and no visceral metastases were associated with a superior outcome (p = 0.011 and p = .001, respectively). With respect to overall survival (OS), better performance status was marginally related to superior outcome (p = 0.096). The revised Tokuhashi scoring system and the Tomita scoring system predicted OS and TSS in patients treated with SBRT. Two patients developed vertebral compression fractures at 1.2 and 1.4 months after SBRT with no evidence of tumor progression. There was no radiation-induced myelopathy. SBRT with a CyberKnife is a safe and effective treatment modality to achieve local control in spinal metastases patients, including those with a previous history of conventional RT. SBRT should be considered for those patients with a relatively indolent primary tumor, good performance status, and no visceral metastases.

Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an alternative ablative local therapy that delivers high RT doses in a few fractions to the cancer, sparing surrounding critical tissue. We have performed a systematic review of published trials to evaluate the efficacy of SBRT as a primary modality therapy for CRC liver oligometastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Pubmed, and EMBASE for publications regarding SBRT for CRC liver metastases. Overall survival (OS: median, 1- and 2-year OS %) was the primary endpoint, and median PFS and one- and two-year local control (LC) were the secondary endpoints. A random-effect model pooled-analysis was performed to calculate the aggregated OS rates at 1 and 2 years as well as the one- and two-year LC. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies, encompassing 656 patients, were included in the analysis. The pooled one- and two-year OS were 67.18% (95% CI, 42.1-92.2) and 56.5% (95% CI, 36.7-76.2), respectively. Median PFS and OS were 11.5 and 31.5 months. The pooled one-year LC was 67% (95% CI, 43.8-90.2), while the pooled two-year LC was 59.3% (95% CI, 37.2-81.5). Correlation analysis revealed a moderate/poor linear relationship between the SBRT (BED10) dose and LC (p = 0.001, R = 0.47)/OS (p = 0.001, R = 0.29) at 2 years. Mild-moderate and severe liver toxicity were 30.7% and 8.7%. CONCLUSION: SBRT for liver oligometastases is an effective option for patients with advanced CRC, with encouraging local control and survival. However, a definitive validation in large randomised studies is required, due to the retrospective or non-randomised nature of the included studies and the limitations of series with different doses/schedules of treatment.",exclusion,Systematic review,Systematic review to take into consideration,

METHODS: Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to the lungs treated with SBRT from 2002 to 2013 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Patients may have received prior systemic therapy, radiotherapy to nonthoracic sites and/or resection of thoracic and/or nonthoracic metastases. Endpoints were timed from end of SBRT and included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, distant metastases-free survival, and local failure-free survival. Univariate and multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to identify prognostic factors. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were identified. Before SBRT, 69.2% and 33.8% of patients received systemic therapy and lung-directed local therapy, respectively, for metastatic disease. At the time of SBRT, 64.6% had lung-only involvement. Median survivals were: OS of 20.3 months (95% confidence intervals [CI], 15.9-27.0 mo), progression-free survival of 5.7 months (95% CI, 3.2-7.0 mo), distant metastases-free survival of 5.8 months (95% CI, 3.2-7.6 mo), and local failure-free survival of 15.4 months (95% CI, 8.5-21.1 mo). Nearly all (98%) patients developed distant progression. Extra lung and liver involvement at the time of initial metastases (hazard ratios [HR] 2.10) and extra lung involvement at SBRT (HR 2.67) were the only independent predictors of OS. Net gross target volume of >14.1 mL (HR 2.49) was the only independent predictor of local failure-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Reasonable survival and local control can be achieved with SBRT. We identified several prognostic factors testable in future prospective trials that may help improve patient selection.",exclusion,No comparator,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12072-016-9783-9 
random-journal.pdf,LivM234,"T., Zhang",2017,English,LIV.M:#1,Stereotactic body radiotherapy for patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma,"Background: According to the guideline, resection, liver transplantation and radiofrequency ablation are the radical treatment options for small hepatocellular carcinoma (sHCC). However, only 10-30% patients with sHCC were eligible for curative therapies due to several reasons. In recent years, technological advances have made it possible to cure the sHCC by radiotherapy, but avoid the risk of radiationinduced liver disease (RILD) at the same time. The CyberKnife() is an stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) system that allows for realtime tracking of the tumor. it is the suitable option for sHCC patients who were unsuited for resection, liver transplantation and radiofrequency ablation. Objective(s): To evaluate the efficiency and safety of stereotactic body radiotherapy for small hepatocellular carcinoma. Method(s): Between March 2011 and December 2012, a total of 28 sHCC patients treated with SBRT were enrolled in this study. Patientes met all of following criteria: (1) the maximal diameter of the tumors <=3 cm; (2) without portal vein tumor thrombosis and lymph node metastases; (3) without extrahepatic metastasis; (4) unsuitable for or rejecting other therapies; (5) Child-Pugh Classification (CPC) AorB; (6) ECOG score 0 or 1; (7) single tumor. The median size of tumors was 2.1cm (range 1.1-3.0 cm), A dose of 10Gy-15Gy per faction was given over 3-6 consecutive days, resulting in a total dose of 35Gy-60Gy. 27 patients which were implanted 3 to 5 fiducials before 7-10 days of cyberknife therapy adopted respiratory tracking and fiducial tracking at the same time, while one patient adopted spine tracking. Result(s): The median follow-up was 36 months (range 3-53 months). Complete response (CR) was attained in 17 cases (60.71%), partial response (PR) was attained in 8 cases (28.57%), stable disease (SD) was attained in 2 cases (7.14%), progression disease (PD) was attained in one case (3.58%). Overall response rate was 89.28%, and the disease control rate was 96.42%. 13 patients have relapsed, among which 3 patients were infield, 9 patients were outfield. There were 6 patients dead during the following-up period. Overall patients survival rates at 1, 2 and 3 years were 92.86, 85.71 and 78.57%, respectively. Local control rates at 1, 2 and 3 years were 96.43, 92.86 and 89.28%, respetively. Toxicity mainly consisted of grade 1 and grade 2 events. Conclusion(s): Cyberknife is a safe and effective system for small hepatocellular carcinoma, which affords good local control, high overall survival rates and low toxicity. Cyberknife should be considered as an alternative treatment for patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma which is unsuitable for surgical treatment.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.1177/107327481602300105

Use of highly targeted, hypofractionated regimens of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is now a primary management option for patients with oligometastatic disease. METHODS: The properties of SBRT are summarized and the results of retrospective and prospective studies of SBRT use in the management of oligometastases are reviewed. Future directions of SBRT, including optimizing dose and fractionation schedules, are also discussed. RESULTS: SBRT can deliver highly conformal, dosed radiation treatments for ablative tumors in a few treatment sessions. Phase 1/2 trials and retrospective institutional results support use of SBRT as a treatment option for oligometastatic disease metastasized to the lung, liver, and spine, and SBRT offers adequate toxicity profiles with good rates of local control. Future directions will involve optimizing dose and fractionation schedules for select histologies to improve rates of local control while limiting toxicity to normal structures. CONCLUSIONS: SBRT offers an excellent management option for patients with oligometastases. However, additional research is still needed to optimize dose and fractionation schedules.",exclusion,"Other study, no comparator",,

However, less than 5% of patients are ultimately candidates due to frequent comorbidities and graft shortage. Traditionally, radiotherapy played a limited role in the treatment of HCC due to the risk of radiationinduced liver disease. Development of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) allows delivery of high-dose conformal radiotherapy with limited liver toxicity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency and safety of SBRT as a local treatment for inoperable HCC. Material and Methods A prospective phase II trial of SBRT for patients with unique HCC was conducted from 2009 to 2014 in three French institutions. Eligibility criteria include d a single HCC lesion; without extra hepatic extension; unsuitable for standard loco regional therapies; with a tumor size from 1 to 6 cm. For patients with cirrhosis, only Child-Pugh (CP) A patients were enrolled. The SBRT dose was 45 Gy in 3 fractions delivered in 8 to 10 days. Primary end point was local control at 18 months, defined as a non-progressive disease of irradiated HCC by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors). Results A total of 44 patients were evaluable. Patients were 43 to 91 years of age (median 72 year). The median tumor size was 28 mm (range, 10-60 mm). Median follow-up was 3.0 years (range, 0.32 months to 4.3 years). All 44 patients had cirrhosis, 38 (88%) were CP grade A, and 5 (12%) grade B. 5 patients (11%) had portal vein involvement and 17 patients (39%) had a portal hypertension. No patients received prior local treatment. Thirteen patients (31%) presented a grade >= 3 acute adverse event of which liver biology perturbation was the most encountered (20,9%). Three patients (10%) experienced a decline in CP at 3 months post-SBRT. There was no grade >= 3 chronic adverse event reported. The 18- and 24-month local control rates were 98% (95% CI, 85%-99%) and 94% (95% CI, 79%-99%), respectively. The 18- and 24-month overall survival rates were 72% (95% CI, 56%-83%) and 69% (95% CI, 53%-81%), respectively. Median survival was 3.5 years. Conclusion Local control and overall survival after SBRT for untreated solitary HCC were excellent despite candidates being unfit for resection and ablation treatments. SBRT should be considered, as bridging to transplant or as definitive therapy for those ineligible for transplant. It should be considered in multidisciplinary committees alongside other localized standard treatments including radiofrequency ablation or transarterial chemoembolization, depending on patients' characteristics, and advantages and disadvantages of each technique.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.1186/s13014-015-0369-9

METHODS: From 2000 to 2009, 74 patients with 91 liver metastases from different primaries have been treated with SBRT at our institution. Median planning target volume was 123 ccm (range: 10.6-1074 ccm). Treatment consisted of 3-5 fractions with 5-12.5 Gy/ fraction prescribed to the surrounding 60-95% isodose with daily image guidance. Regular follow-up included CT or MRI imaging until tumor progression. RESULTS: Median local recurrence-free interval was 23 months with a local control rate of 74.7%, 48.3% and 48.3% after 1, 2 and 3 years. Only minimum biologically effective dose (BED) to gross tumor volume (GTV) remained as independent significant factor for local control in multivariate analysis. No local recurrences were observed in lesions (n = 12) which received a minimal BED to the GTV of 120 Gy. Including 26 local recurrences, 67 patients (91%) showed disease progression after SBRT with a median time of 5 months. Median overall survival was 27 months with survival rates of 77%, 30% and 27% at 1, 3 and 5 years. On multivariate analysis only GTV volume remained as independent significant prognostic factor for overall survival (p = 0.002). No grade 3 to 5 acute toxicity and no grade 4 or 5 late toxicity occurred. CONCLUSION: SBRT for liver metastases was well tolerated in this non-selected patient cohort and yielded good local control despite the considerable size of most lesions treated.

Material(s) and Method(s): Between 2006 and 2018 36 patients aged between 80 and 90 years underwent 46 SRFA sessions of 70 primary and secondary liver tumors. For comparison of treatment safety and efficacy 36 younger patients were selected with propensity score matching by the R package ""MatchIt"" in this retrospective, single-center study. Result(s): 68/70 tumors were successfully ablated at first ablation session (97% primary technical efficacy rate). Local tumor recurrence developed in 5 of 70 nodules (7.1%). The complication rate above Clavien-Dindo Grade III was 6.5% (3 of 46). The overall survival (OS) rates at 1-, 3-, and 5- years from the date of the first SRFA were 84.6, 50.5, and 37.9% for HCC patients and 87.5%, 52.5% at 1-, and 3-years for CRC patients. The disease-free survival (DFS) for HCC patients after SRFA was 79.1, 35.6, and 23.7%, at 1-, 3-, and 5- years, and 75%, 22.5% at 1-, and 3-years for CRC patients. There were no significant differences in terms of technical efficacy, local recurrences, major complications, OS and DFS compared to the control group. Conclusion(s): SRFA in octogenarians is a safe, feasible and useful option in the management of primary or metastatic liver tumors with no significant difference in outcomes compared to a younger control group.© Copyright © 2019 Schullian, Putzer, Silva, Laimer, Kolbitsch and Bale.",exclusion,Wrong intervention,,10.1007/s00066-018-1349-4

The optimal beam geometry for SRT, however, has not been defined. Here we evaluate a combination technique with dynamic conformal arcs (DCAs) and intensity-modulated static fields (IMRT), known as HybridArc™ (HA). METHODS: For the first consecutive 25 cases with choroidal melanomas with volumes of 0.02 to 1.18 cm(3) treated with 50 Gy in five fractions, the results with respect to dose conformity, homogeneity, and dose distributions were summarised. To describe the dose distribution at the planning target volume (PTV) boundary, we defined a spatially averaged dose gradient (SADG) and compared it with Paddick's gradient index (GI). We made dosimetric comparisons between HA and other irradiation techniques. RESULTS: The PTVs ranged from 0.42 to 3.37 cm(3). The conformity index (CI) was 1.25 ± 0.15, and the homogeneity index (HI) 0.08 ± 0.02. The SADG was (-3.5 ± 0.5) Gy/mm or (-7.0 ± 1.0) %/mm between the isodose levels 95 and 20%; local minima reached -11.5 Gy/mm or -22.9%/mm. The coefficient of determination for a nonlinear regression of GI on SADG was 0.072. After a median follow-up time of 19.6 months, local tumour control was 100% without any case of post-therapeutic enucleation. Two patients (8%) developed liver metastases. CONCLUSION: SRT of ocular tumours by HA is highly appropriate, and HA is superior to intensity-modulated arc therapy (IMAT) concerning dose reduction in organs at risk (OARs). The novel gradient measure SADG is more informative than Paddick's GI.",exclusion,"Wrong patients, no comparator",,10.1016/j.ctarc.2019.100124

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Unoperable patients with sufficient liver function had [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography-computed tomography and liver magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the oligorecurrent nature of the disease and to further delineate the gross tumor volume (GTV). An intended dose of 45 Gy in 3 fractions was prescribed on the 80% isodose and adapted if risk-related. Treatment was executed with the CyberKnife system (Accuray Inc) platform using fiducials tracking. Initial plans were recalculated using the Monte Carlo algorithm. Patient and treatment data were processed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test for survival analysis. RESULTS: Between 2010 and 2015, 42 patients (55 lesions) were irradiated. The mean GTV and planning target volume (PTV) were 30.5 cc and 96.8 cc, respectively. Treatments were delivered 3 times per week in a median of 3 fractions to a PTV median dose of 54.6 Gy. The mean GTV and PTV D98% were 51.6 Gy and 51.2 Gy, respectively. Heterogeneity corrections did not influence dose parameters. After a median follow-up of 18.9 months, the 1- and 2-year LC/liver PFS/DFS/OS were 81.3%/55%/62.4%/86.9%, and 76.3%/42.3%/52%/78.3%, respectively. Performance status and histology had a significant effect on LC, whereas age (older than 65 years) marginally influenced liver PFS. Clinical target volume physical dose V45 Gy > 95%, generalized equivalent uniform dose (a = -30) > 45 Gy and a BED (α/β = 10) V105 Gy > 96% showed statistically significant effect on the LC. Acute Grade 3 gastrointestinal (GI) and late Grade 2 GI and fatigue toxicity were found in 5% and 11% patients, respectively.

METHODS: A matched pair analysis of 36 patients who underwent MWA of primary or secondary liver malignancies (10 hepatocellular carcinoma and 8 metastases) was conducted. A total of 18 patients undergoing SMWA were included in this prospective study. Patients were matched in terms of tumor size, liver segment and entity to retrospective CMWA procedures. The endpoints were procedure time, accuracy of needle placement, technical success rate, complication rate and dose-length product (DLP). RESULTS: The procedure durations were 23.9 min (SD 3.7) for CMWA and 21.8 min (SD 16.3) for SMWA (p = 0.22). The procedural accuracy for SMWA and CMWA was identical for both groups (3.7 mm). The total DLP was significantly lower for SMWA than for CMWA (2115 mGy cm (SD 276) vs. 3109 mGy cm (SD 1137), respectively; p < 0.01). Complete ablation without residual tumor was observed in 94% (17 of 18) of SMWA and in 83% (15 of 18) of CMWA patients (p = 0.31). No complications occurred.

A total of 79 patients treated with SBRT for primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) between 2004 and 2012 in six Japanese institutions were studied retrospectively. Patients treated with SBRT preceded by trans-arterial chemoembolization were eligible. Their median age was 73 years, 76% were males, and their Child-Pugh scores were Grades A (85%) and B (11%) before SBRT. The median biologically effective dose (α/β = 10 Gy) was 96.3 Gy. The median follow-up time was 21.0 months for surviving patients. The 2-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and distant metastasis-free survival were 53%, 40% and 76%, respectively. Sex and serum PIVKA-II values were significant predictive factors for OS. Hypovascular or hypervascular types of HCC, sex and clinical stage were significant predictive factors for PFS. The 2-year PFS was 66% in Stage I vs 18% in Stages II-III. Multivariate analysis indicated that clinical stage was the only significant predictive factor for PFS. No Grade 3 laboratory toxicities in the acute, sub-acute, and chronic phases were observed.

Currently, however, accurate predictive markers for oligometastatic tumors are still lacking. For this reason, it remains challenging to translate this concept into clinical recommendations. In the present work, we review recent publications on oligometastases in colorectal cancer, showing the evidences for such presentation and underlying the need for the identification of biomarkers, necessary to further develop new therapeutic strategies. RECENT FINDINGS: This review of recently published series confirms that long-term survival and cure could be obtained in patients undergoing surgical resection for colorectal metastases, particularly in the cases of liver metastases. Similar results are observed in other secondary sites such as in pulmonary metastases. Furthermore, in patients with unresectable metastases, significant survival benefit could be still obtained using nonresectional targeted approaches, as thermal ablation or stereotactic radiotherapy. Although these clinical evidences could now serve as proof-of-concept for the existence of an oligometastatic phenotype in colorectal cancer, neither clinical characteristics nor biological biomarkers have been established to be able to prospectively define the patients that will benefit from such therapeutic approaches targeting the metastatic sites. This emphasizes the need for further studies aiming at better defining early clinical and biological characteristics of these patients. As, currently, the reliable identification of the oligometastatic patients could only rely on the demonstration of favorable long-term outcomes after metastases-directed therapies, we propose that retrospective studies will be pivotal to analyze this question. SUMMARY: Extensive research is undergoing to define biologically the oligometastatic phenotype in colorectal cancer. Currently, the selection of the patients for potentially curative metastasectomy remains mostly empirical.",exclusion,Review about oligometastases,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.06.279 
random-journal.pdf,LivM248,"W.H., Smith",2019,English,LIV.M:#2;LIV.P:#2,The Effect of Radiation Therapy on the Objective Response and Outcomes with Nivolumab for Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Purpose/Objective(s): Nivolumab has been shown to be effective as second line therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but the objective response rate (ORR) is only 18% with just 1% achieving a complete response (CR). Data in other disease sites suggest that patients treated with radiation therapy (RT) are more likely to demonstrate an OR to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Given the ability of RT to act as an ""in situ"" vaccine, this study explores if exposure to RT increases the ORR to nivolumab in HCC. Materials/Methods: We retrospectively queried our institutional IRB-approved HCC database for patients treated with external beam RT between 1/2012-9/2018. Patients were included who received RT prior to on concurrent with nivolumab initiation (upfront RT) or who received RT to residual or progressive disease following nivolumab initiation (salvage RT cohort). Patients were excluded who had mixed histology cancers, other active cancers, and who received prior Y-90. The primary endpoint was ORR based on mRECIST criteria. ORR comparisons were performed by univariate logistic regression. Secondary endpoints included progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Survival outcomes were determined using Kaplan-Meier estimates and compared for responders and non-responders using the log-rank test. Result(s): We identified 84 patients who received RT in combination with nivolumab, of these 35 met inclusion criteria; 26 with upfront RT and 9 with salvage RT. Median follow-up was 7.1 months. Most patients had metastatic disease (65.7%) and 14 (40%) had gross vascular invasion. RT was delivered to the liver in 24 cases (64.9%) and with SBRT technique in 17 cases (45.9%) to a median dose of 37.5 Gy. Among those with upfront RT exposure, the ORR was 34.6% including 3 patients (11.5%) with CR and 6 patients (23.1%) with partial response (PR). Of these, 6 demonstrated responses outside RT treated lesions while 3 had responses in RT treated lesions with no evaluable disease beyond the RT field; in no case was an OR isolated to an RT treated lesion with unresponsive disease elsewhere. In the salvage cohort, the ORR was 11.1% consisting of a single patient who achieved a PR to the RT treated site alone with stable disease elsewhere. The median PFS for responders was not reached compared to 2.3 months for non-responders (p < 0.001). Median OS for responders was not reached compared to 22.7 months for non-responders (p = 0.024). Conclusion(s): Exposure to upfront RT was associated with a substantially increased ORR to nivolumab in HCC compared to historical controls. However, salvage RT to sites of residual or progressive disease while on nivolumab failed to stimulate an OR outside of the RT field in our cohort. These data need to be verified in a larger prospective cohort to see if combination immunotherapy and radiation can improve outcomes for patients with advanced HCC.Copyright © 2019",exclusion,No comparator,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1586/14737140.2015.1105745

The optimal management of these patients remains unclear with the treatment approach currently undergoing a paradigm shift. The potential benefit of aggressive metastasis directed local treatment with surgery and/or radiotherapy (RT) in combination with systemic therapy is bolstered predominantly by retrospective analyses but also by a growing number of non-randomized prospective studies regarding the use of ablative RT techniques including stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), alternatively termed stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), directed at the primary tumor (if present) and all metastatic sites. Long-term survival is possible in a subset of patients treated aggressively in this manner. The challenge for the clinical oncology community moving forward is appropriately selecting patients for this treatment approach based on clinical, imaging, and molecular features and increasing enrollment of patients to prospective clinical trials to more definitively determine the added benefit and appropriate timing of aggressive metastasis directed therapy in the oligometastatic setting.",exclusion,,Review?,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2016.06.972

We examine the effects of radiation dose as measured by the biological equivalent dose (BED) in a cohort of HCC patients identified in a large national database. Materials/Methods: Patients with unresectable, non-metastatic HCC that received SBRT were identified from the National Cancer Database (2004-2013). Survival outcomes were compared using Kaplan Meier curves and log-rank tests, and multivariate Cox (MVC) proportional hazards model to examine the predictors of survival. BED was calculated for each patient using the delivered dose, number of fractions, and an a/b ratio of 10. Result(s): A total of 461 patients met the inclusion criteria. Median patient age and tumor size were 62 years (27-90) and 3.2 cm (0.6-17), respectively. Charlson comorbidity index score was 0 in 61%, 1 in 20%, and 2 in 19%. By stage 56% were stage I, 29% were stage II, and 15% were stage III. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was elevated in 52.9%, and 32% received chemotherapy. The median BED was 100 Gy (22.5-208.0), which was also the most common dose fractionation (50 Gy in 5 fractions) in 21.7%. Other common scheme included: 40 Gy in 5 fractions (BED of 72 Gy) in 14.8%, 48 Gy in 3 fractions (BED of 124 Gy) in 10.7%, and 45 Gy in 3 fractions (BED of 112.5 Gy) in 6.7%. For this entire cohort, the median OS after SBRT was 20.3 months. An apparent dose response was observed with improved survival with increasing BED. The median and 1-year OS were 15.3 months and 56.6% for BED-75, 18.3 months and 67.5% for BED>75 and 100, and 37.2 months and 81.4% for BED>100, P< 0.001. When controlling for other factors (tumor size, AFP, stage, comorbidity level, age, type of institution and type of insurance), an increased BED was associated with longer OS regardless of how BED was analyzed (see table 1). In addition, elevated AFP (HR 1.803, 95% CI 1.235-2.632, P = 0.002) and increased tumor size (HR 1.085, 95% CI 1.023-1.150, P = 0.006) were associated with worse survival. Conclusion(s): In this sizable cohort of HCC patients treated with SBRT, those who received higher BED appear to have improved OS, even when controlling for multiple other factors. While many factors influence the (Table presented) determination of dose for any given patient, this data may suggests that efforts to safely increase BED may result in improved survival outcomes. This concept, as well as strategies, to achieve it should be investigated in prospective clinical trials.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.1186/s12885-019-5362-5

METHODS: The analysis is based on pooled data from two retrospective SBRT databases for pulmonary and hepatic metastases from 27 centers from Germany and Switzerland. Only patients with metastases from colorectal cancer were considered to avoid histology as a confounding factor. An illness-death model was employed to model the relationship between LC and OS. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-eight patients with 500 metastatic lesions (lung n = 209, liver n = 291) were included and analyzed. Median follow-up time for local recurrence assessment was 12.1 months. Ninety-nine patients with 112 lesions experienced local failure. Seventy-one of these patients died after local failure. Median survival time was 27.9 months in all patients and 25.4 months versus 30.6 months in patients with and without local failure after SBRT. The baseline risk of death after local failure exceeds the baseline risk of death without local failure at 10 months indicating better survival with LC.

We investigated the role of different clinical and inflammatory parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included all patients treated with SRT for 1-5 oligometastases between 2003 and 2017 in our center. Patients were randomized between a model training set (2/3) and a separate validation set (1/3). A Cox regression model was built, validated and risk points were attributed to the resulting parameters. RESULTS: 403 patients received SRT for 760 metastases. Treated sites were mainly lung, liver, nodal areas, and brain. Most common primaries were colorectal and lung cancer. Median follow-up for living patients reached 42 months and median overall survival (MS) was 26.6 months (95% CI 23.8-29.3). Five independent adverse factors were discriminated: male sex, synchronous timing of oligometastases, brain metastasis, non-adenocarcinoma histology, KPS <80. A risk score is formed by summation of the points of each factor (M:4, T:2, B:7, N:7, K:8). Four risk groups were defined: (1) 0-2 points: MS 41.2 months (95% CI 30.2-52.3); (2) 3-8 points: 29.3 months (24.6-34.0); (3) 9-13 points: 17.4 months (10.1-24.7), and (4) 14-28 points: 7.9 months (5.5-10.3). CONCLUSION: We propose a prognostic score applicable in a variety of primary tumors and disease locations, including presence of brain metastases. The nomogram and risk groups can be used to stratify patients in new trials and to support individualized care for oligometastatic patients.

Results of large case series of selected patients treated with complete surgical resection of metastatic lesions suggest that this approach substantially improves survival rates to around 30‐60%. Other techniques such as radiofrequency or microwave ablation (RFA, MWA), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) can also be applied in local treatment. Curative treatment options are generally not available for patients with extensive hepatic and/or extrahepatic mCRC. These patients primarily receive palliative systemic treatment consisting of combination chemotherapy as well as targeted agents. So far, reports on the benefit of local treatment for metastases in multi‐organ mCRC have major limitations, including being small, non‐randomized, single‐center and retrospective. The benefit from local treatment of metastases for these patients should be established to allow for interruption of the standard systemic therapy and exposure to possible adverse events from local treatment. Methods: The 'ORCHESTRA' trial is a randomized multicenter clinical trial for patients with multi‐organ mCRC, comparing the combination of chemotherapy and maximal tumor debulking versuschemotherapy alone (NCT01792934 ). We will examine the interplay of both efficacy and toxicity for the combination of systemic chemotherapy and locoregional therapy. Our study design incorporates systemic as well as local therapy in the experimental arm and combines local treatment modalities to pursue maximal tumor debulking. We aim to improve overall survival of patients with multi‐organ mCRC by maximal tumor debulking after induction chemotherapy with at least six months. A total of 478 patients will be included to meet the primary endpoint (power 80%, type I error rate 5%). We define local treatments feasible when they can be performed within a 3‐month time period to prevent extensive delay of systemic therapy.

METHODS: From 17 German and Swiss centers, data on all patients treated for liver oligometastases with SBRT since its introduction in 1997 has been collected and entered into a centralized database. In addition to patient and tumor characteristics, data on immobilization, image guidance and motion management as well as dose prescription and fractionation has been gathered. Besides dose response and survival statistics, time trends of the aforementioned variables have been investigated. RESULTS: In total, 474 patients with 623 liver oligometastases (median 1 lesion/patient; range 1–4) have been collected from 1997 until 2015. Predominant histologies were colorectal cancer (n = 213 pts.; 300 lesions) and breast cancer (n = 57; 81 lesions). All centers employed an SBRT specific setup. Initially, stereotactic coordinates and CT simulation were used for treatment set-up (55%), but eventually were replaced by CBCT guidance (28%) or more recently robotic tracking (17%). High variance in fraction (fx) number (median 1 fx; range 1–13) and dose per fraction (median: 18.5 Gy; range 3–37.5 Gy) was observed, although median BED remained consistently high after an initial learning curve. Median follow-up time was 15 months; median overall survival after SBRT was 24 months. One- and 2-year treated metastases control rate of treated lesions was 77% and 64%; if maximum isocenter biological equivalent dose (BED) was greater than 150 Gy EQD2Gy, it increased to 83% and 70%, respectively. Besides radiation dose colorectal and breast histology and motion management methods were associated with improved treated metastases control. CONCLUSION: After an initial learning curve with regards to total cumulative doses, consistently high biologically effective doses have been employed translating into high local tumor control at 1 and 2 years. The true impact of histology and motion management method on treated metastases control deserve deeper analysis.

Little research has looked into the safety and efficacy of combining capecitabine and irinotecan (CAPIRI) with C due to early studies with doubts on its safety. We hypothesized that by means of a modified regime, mCAPIRI-C could be a potentially safe and efficacious alternative to FOLFIRI-C. Method(s): We performed a single-centre, retrospective cohort investigating the clinical outcome of mCAPIRI-C among CRC patients with upfront unresectable liver-only metastases identified at Hepatobiliary Multidisciplinary meetings of Tuen Mun Hospital during June 2012 - June 2018. Serial clinical, biochemical and radiological assessments were performed for evaluation. Result(s): The population (N=47) had a median age of 61 years old (range 40-72 years old), a majority of men (n=32, 68%), colon primary (n=36, 77%), right-sided (n=6, 13%), synchronous tumors and metastases (n=36, 77%), while almost half of them had fewer than 5 liver metastases (n=23, 49%). The median number of cycles of concurrent C used was 6 (range 2-13 cycles). With the use of mCAPIRI-C, we have achieved a high total conversion rate of 62% (n=29), with 45% (n=21) of the population subsequently undergoing R0 resection, 13% (n=6) underwent other potentially curative interventions including radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SBRT) and only 2% (n=1) had an R2 resection. We have also evaluated the radiological response of conversion therapy with mCAPIRI-C by means of the RECIST 1.1 criteria, with a remarkable overall response rate of up to 83% (i.e. complete response CR, partial response PR or stable disease SD) (n=39), of which 6% (n=3) achieved radiological CR and 77% (n=36) achieved PR. Median follow-up was 18.7 months (range 1.7-52.1months) with an overall median PFS up to 15.1 months and an overall median OS of 40.5 months. Of those who have received subsequent potential curative therapies (surgery/RFA/SBRT), a significant benefit versus those who did not undergo any subsequent liver-directed therapies was seen, with a PFS gain of 15.1 months (P < .001) and OS was not yet reached (P= .002). Treatment was well-tolerated overall with only 2 patients (4%) experiencing Grade 4 neutropenia and no other reported Grade 4 toxicities. The most common Grade 3 toxicity was neutropenia (n=5, 11%) and a strikingly low amount of Grade 3 skin reactions (n=3, 6%), diarrhea (n=2, 4%) and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (n=1, 2%) reactions were reported. There were also no treatment-related 60-day mortalities nor 30-day postoperative mortalities. Conclusion(s): The use of mCAPIRI-C appears to be safe and efficacious among CRC patients with unresectable liver-only metastases. Our results suggest a high clinical response rate and an encouraging rate of subsequent potentially curative liver-directed therapies with significant survival benefits.

Predictive biomarkers for liver toxicity would allow for careful patient selection and the adaptation of therapy. Prior studies have shown specific miRNAs are elevated prior to clinical signs of toxin induced liver injury. We hypothesized that miRNAs can be used to predict radiation induced liver toxicity prior to clinical manifestations. Method(s): As part of an IRB approved clinical trial (NCT01522937 ) patients with liver tumors underwent a split course of SBRT. All patients underwent liver function testing using indocyanine green clearance (ICG) followed by three SBRT fractions. One month later ICG was reassessed and two more fractions were given if the patient did not have a decline in liver function. Plasma samples were obtained at baseline and 1 month after finishing three of five SBRT fractions for 89 patients. For this exploratory analysis, we selected the 10 patients that had a 2+ point increase in Child-Turcotte-Pugh score within 6 months of completing therapy and 19 additional patients without toxicity. The levels of 752 miRNAs were quantified for each sample using qPCR. We then used a univariate tree based classifier and the elastic net with 10-fold cross validation to calculate the AUC for predicting liver toxicity in individual and small groups of miRNAs, respectively. Result(s): Several miRNAs were found to be potentially predictive of toxicity on univariate tree based classifier analysis including the liver specific microRNA miR.122.3p, the epithelial specific miR.141.3p and miR.200b.3p, the neuroendocrine related miR.375 and miR.217, and miR.125a.5p which plays a role in hepatitis and regulates ERBB2 and ERBB3 signaling. The elastic net model achieved a conservative AUC estimate of 0.74 +/- 0.04 using 69 baseline miRNAs and 0.76 +/- 0.06 using 11 mid-treatment miRNAs to predict toxicity. Conclusion(s): Our preliminary analysis of the miRNAome from 29 patients receiving liver SBRT shows promising results for the ability of these markers to select patients at risk for radiation induced liver toxicity.

Method(s): In this retrospective case-control study, 60 patients (14 with Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 46 with metastatic liver tumors) with CT 'invisible' lesions underwent SRFA using MRI-fusion between June 2005 and June 2018 ('fusion group'). For comparison, 60 patients who underwent SRFA without image fusion were selected using nearest neighbor propensity score matching ('control group'). Endpoints consisted of local tumor control, safety, overall and disease-free survival. Result(s): Major complications occurred in 6/69 ablations (8.7%) in the fusion group and in 6/89 ablations (6.7%) in the control group (p = 0.434). Primary technical efficacy rate (i.e., successful initial ablation) was 96.6% (28/29) for HCC and 97.9% (166/170) for metastatic disease in the fusion group and 100% (33/33) and 93.3% (184/194) in the control group, respectively (p = 0.468 and 0.064). Local recurrence (LR) was observed in 1/29 (3.5%) HCCs and in 6/170 metastases (4.0%) in the fusion group and 1/33 (3.0%) and 21/196 (10.7%) in the control group, respectively. The LR rate of metastasis in the control group was significantly higher (p = 0.007), although differences in OS and DFS did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion(s): Image fusion using pre-procedural MRI allows for ablation of CT-'invisible' liver tumors that are otherwise untreatable. Moreover, local oncological control was higher in metastatic liver tumors versus matched controls which suggests it could be useful tool for all stereotactic radiofrequency ablation procedures.Copyright © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

A total of 64 patients who underwent SBRT for liver tumors, including 54 cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 10 non-cirrhotic patients with liver metastases, were analyzed. MRI was performed 3-6 months after SBRT, using gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced T1-weighted sequences. All MRI datasets were merged with 3D dosimetry data. All dose distributions were corrected to the biologically effective dose using the linear-quadratic model with an assumed α/β ratio of 2 Gy. The development of liver dysfunction was validly correlated with isodose distribution. The median biologically effective dose (BED2) that provoked liver dysfunction was 57.3 (30.0-227.9) and 114.0 (70.4-244.9) Gy in cirrhotic and normal livers, respectively (P = 0.0002). The BED2 associated with a >5% risk of liver dysfunction was 38.5 in cirrhotic livers and 70.4 Gy in normal livers. The threshold BED2 for liver dysfunction was not significantly different between Child-Pugh A and B patients (P = 0.0719). Moreover, the fractionation schedule was not significantly correlated with threshold BED2 for liver dysfunction in the cirrhotic liver (P = 0.1019). In the cirrhotic liver, fractionation regimen and Child-Pugh classification did not significantly influence the threshold BED2 for focal liver damage after SBRT.

Increasing energy deposition in the tumor while at the same time maintaining the dose in healthy tissue remains a major challenge in radiation oncology that could be achieved by NBTXR3 (hafnium oxide nanoparticles) when activated by radiotherapy (RT). NBTXR3 augments energy dose deposit within tumor cells, increasing tumor cell death compared to RT alone, while sparing healthy tissues. Patients (pts) with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or liver metastasis (mets) may benefit from the mode of action of NBTXR3. A phase I/II clinical trial has been conducted to evaluate NBTXR3 activated by SBRT in these pts [NCT02721056]. Method(s): The Phase I used a 3+3 dose escalation scheme with 5 NBTXR3 dose levels: 10, 15, 22, 33, and 42% of baseline tumor volume. NBTXR3 was administered by intratumoral injection (ITI) followed by SBRT (45 Gy / 3 fractions / 5 to 7 days or 50 Gy / 5 fractions / 15 days). Primary endpoints were identification of the recommended Phase II Dose and early DLTs. Secondary endpoints included safety profile, liver function evaluated by Child-Pugh score (CPS), AST to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), and early efficacy by response rate (mRECIST/RECIST 1.1). Result(s): The dose escalation levels of 10, 15, 22 and 33% are completed (n = 17): 6 pts at 10% (2 SBRT doses tested due to organ constraints), 4 pts each at 15% and 22% (due to fiducial displacement and ITI shift) and 3 pts at 33%. No early DLT was observed and only one SAE (bile duct stenosis) related to NBTXR3 and RT occurred. CPS and APRI did not show clinically meaningful changes posttreatment and CT-scan showed no leakage of NBTXR3 into surrounding tissues. Best response for HCC (n = 8) were 5CR, 3PR and for mets (n = 6) the results were: 3 PR, 3SD. Conclusion(s): ITI of NBTXR3 is feasible, demonstrated a very good safety and tolerability profile up to the 33% dose level. Recruitment needs to be finalized at the 42% dose level. Based on early efficacy results NBTXR3 has the potential to address an unmet medical need in pts with unresectable primary or metastatic liver cancer.",exclusion,Other study design,,

The reported local control rate following stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is widely variable. Similar to MWA some studies do however suggest that size of the lesion also has an impact on local control rate. As of yet it is unclear what the preferred ablative treatment option for unresectable CRLM 3-5 cm should be No randomized controlled trials have been performed comparing SABR to MWA. Clinical Findings/Procedure: Most studies concerning MWA and SABR are retrospective or prospective cohort studies with a heterogeneous study population. For SABR the 1-year local control rate ranges 50-80%. For MWA the superior 1-year local control rate for CRLM <=3 cm of around 95% also drops below 80% for CRLM >3 cm. For both techniques the complication rate is low: major adverse events occur in 0-9% of patients receiving SABR and in approximately 2-4% of patients receiving MWA Conclusion(s): Further research is necessary to determine what treatment option is preferable for intermediate-size unresectable colorectal liver metastases, preferably in the setting of a randomized controlled trial comparing the safety and the longer-term local tumor progression rates.",exclusion,Wrong comparator,,10.1016/j.breast.2018.09.006
random-journal.pdf,LivM261,"Onal, Cem",2018,eng,LIV.M:#5,Treatment outcomes of breast cancer liver metastasis treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: To assess the outcomes of breast cancer liver metastasis (BCLM) treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and systemic treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with oligometastasis at the time of liver metastasis (LM) or who became oligometastatic (≤5 metastases) after systemic treatment were assessed. Twenty-nine liver metastatic lesions were treated with a total of 54 Gy delivered in 3 fractions. The local control (LC), overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analyses. RESULTS: A total of 22 patients with 29 liver metastatic lesions treated with liver SBRT between April 2013 and September 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. After a median follow-up time of 16.0 months (range 4.4-59.4 months), 18 patients (82%) had disease recurrence, median of 7.4 months (range 1.0-27.9 months) after completion of liver SBRT. The 1- and 2-year OS rates were 85% and 57%, and the 1- and 2-year PFS rates were 38% and 8%, respectively. The 1- and 2-year LC rates were 100% and 88%, respectively. No significant prognostic factors, including disease extension, size of metastasis, number of liver metastasis and timing of liver metastasis, hormonal status affecting OS, PFS and LC were found. No patients experienced Grade 4 or 5 toxicity; furthermore, only one patient experienced rib fracture 6 months after completion of treatment, and one patient had a duodenal ulcer. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to evaluate the feasibility of SBRT to BCLM patients. Liver SBRT is a conservative approach with excellent LC and limited toxicities.",exclusion,No comparators,,10.1007/s13277-015-3337-y

Previously, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and albumin were identified as relevant biomarkers. We performed a retrospective analysis of 120 patients with known LDH and albumin treated with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in two different situations: (1) brain metastases detected at initial cancer diagnosis (n = 46) and (2) brain metastases at later time points (n = 74, median interval 13 months). Twenty-six patients (57 %) from group 1 had at least one tumor marker analyzed, and 11 patients (24 %) had abnormal results. Twenty-two patients (30 %) from group 2 had at least one tumor marker analyzed, and 16 patients (22 %) had abnormal results. When assuming that LDH and albumin would be standard tests before WBRT, additional potential biomarkers were found in 36 % of patients with normal LDH and albumin. Marker positivity rates were for example 80 % for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in colorectal cancer and 79 % for CA 15-3 in breast cancer. Abnormal markers were associated with presence of liver metastases. CA 15-3 values above median predicted shorter survival in patients with breast cancer (median 1.9 vs. 13.8 months, p = 0.1). Comparable trends were not observed for various markers in other tumor types. In conclusion, only a minority of patients had undergone tumor marker analyses. Final group sizes were too small to perform multivariate analyses or draw definitive conclusions. We hypothesize that CA 15-3 could be a promising biomarker that should be studied further.",exclusion,Wrong patients,,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2018.09.011

This study investigates whether tumor trailing on a magnetic resonance (MR) linear accelerator (linac) can improve target coverage in liver stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in the case of baseline motion. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For 17 patients with oligometastatic liver disease, midposition SBRT treatment plans (3 × 20 Gy, 11-beam intensity modulated radiotherapy) were created for the Elekta Unity MR-Linac. Treatment was simulated using an in-house-developed delivery emulator. Respiratory motion was modelled as the superposition of periodic motion (patient-specific amplitude, 4-second period) and the following baseline motion scenarios: a continuous linear drift (0.5 mm/min), (2) a single shift halfway through treatment (10 mm), (3) a periodic drift (amplitude: 5 mm, period: 5 minutes), or (4) MR imaging-measured baseline drifts. Delivered dose was calculated under full consideration of the patient and machine motion interplay. In addition, trailing was experimentally validated on the MR-Linac using a programmable motion phantom. RESULTS: The average simulated delivery and beam-on times were 15.9 and 8.7 minutes, respectively. An imaging frequency of ≥1 Hz was deemed necessary for trailing. Trailing increased the median gross tumor volume D98% dose by 1.9 Gy (linear drift), 1.2 Gy (single shift), 0.7 Gy (periodic drift), and 0.5 to 1.5 Gy (measured drifts) per fraction, compared with a conventional delivery. In the phantom experiments, the 3%/2 mm local gamma pass rate nearly doubled to 98% when using trailing. CONCLUSION: Tumor trailing on the MR-Linac restores target dose in liver SBRT in the case of baseline motion for the presented patient cohort.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.4143/crt.2015.207

The current study was conducted to investigate current practice patterns and compare them with the results of the PCS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The survey questionnaire was composed of 10 questions regarding general information and seven questions for each of two clinical scenarios. RESULTS: Fifty-four members of the KOSRO answered at least one question on the web-based questionnaire. The yearly number of patients treated who underwent palliative spine RT was greater than 200 in 14 (25.9%), 51 to 100 in 13 (24.1%), and 31 to 50 in 11 respondents (20.4%). Scenario 1 described a patient presenting with cord compressive spine metastasis in multiple bones and liver metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer. Thirty gray (Gy) in 10 fractions was chosen by 35 respondents (64.8%). Scenario 2 described a case of a single spine metastasis without progression after targeted therapy. Thirty Gy in 10 fractions was chosen by 19 respondents (35.2%), and a single fraction or less than four fractions of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) were selected by 18 respondents (33.3%). When compared with the 2009 PCS, practice patterns of Korean radiation oncologists had not changed significantly over 5 years, except that SABR emerged as a new treatment modality in the selected population. CONCLUSION: The 2014 PCS demonstrated that multiple fraction RT is still preferred in a considerable proportion of Korean radiation oncologists.",exclusion,"Wrong patients, no comparator",,10.1111/codi.14314

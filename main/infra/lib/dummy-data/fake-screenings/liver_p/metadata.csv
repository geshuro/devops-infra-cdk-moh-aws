random-journal.pdf,LivP1,"Czauderna, Carolin",2020,ger,LIV.M:#3;LIV.P:#5,[Monocentric experiences of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for advanced hepatocellular carcinomas (BCLC-C)].,"Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are highly malignant primary liver cancers with poor prognosis and limited treatment options in advanced stages of disease. Treatment of HCC requires interdisciplinary discussion and multimodal therapy approaches. Beside established loco-regional and systemic therapies, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) gained increasing importance over recent years. First results of early clinical studies indicate high rates of local control with a good safety profile. In the present work, we evaluated our single center experiences with SBRT in patients with advanced HCCs.Ten patients with 16 SBRTs were included and retrospectively analyzed in this case collection. All patients presented in advanced tumor stages with vascular invasion and/or metastases, but preserved liver function. Two patients were treated only with SBRT, two after TACE and six patients received SBRT in addition to systemic therapy. In most of the cases SBRT were applied to intrahepatic lesions. Large tumor thromboses, lymph nodes as well as bone metastases were irradiated in one, three and five fractions with a median overall dose of 38 Gy. We observed a good local tumor control with a good safety profile in all cases. No severe complications occurred in combination to sequential as well as additive approach to loco-regional or systemic treatments.In conclusion, our experiences confirm results of early clinical studies indicating safe use and good local control rates also in advanced stages of HCC with preserved liver function.",exclusion,Written in german,,10.1055/a-1072-6683,,,,
random-journal.pdf,LivP2,"Le Bon, M",2019,fre,LIV.P:#5*,[Tolerance of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for hepatic tumours].,"PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the outcomes of stereotactic radiation therapy for primary and secondary liver tumours in Jean-Perrin cancer centre (Clermont-Ferrand, France) in terms of efficacy and safety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between December 2013 and June 2016, 25 patients were included. Treatment was performed on a linear accelerator Novalis TX(®). The prescription dose was 42 to 60Gy in three to five fractions. Local control at 1 year was evaluated with modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (mRECIST) and RECIST criteria. Acute and late toxicity were evaluated with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 criteria. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 10.5 months. Treatment tolerance was good with few side effects grade 3 or above, no acute toxicity and only one late toxicity. We have highlighted that hepatic artery haemorrhage was associated with the presence of a biliary prosthesis in contact with the artery (P=0.006) and in the irradiation field. There was no correlation with the dose delivered to the artery and hepatic artery haemorrhage. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic radiation therapy for liver tumours allows a good local control with few secondary effects. Caution should be exercised when treating patients with biliary prostheses in the vicinity of the target volume because there is a risk of haemorrhage of the hepatic artery in contact with the prosthesis.",exclusion,Wrong intervention,,10.1016/j.canrad.2019.02.004,,,,

Materials: Patients with HCC undergoing Ablation or SBRT from 2006-2016 with available follow up were included. Treatment groups were different at baseline regarding tumor stage (BCLC A, B and C: 96%, 4%, 0% (Ablation) vs 73%, 14% and 13% (SBRT), P<0.001) and severity of liver disease (CTP A, B and C: 55%, 45% and 0% (Ablation) vs 50%, 41% and 9% (SBRT), P=0.007). Propensity scores were therefore calculated with age, sex, BCLC stage, CTP class, etiology of liver disease, tumor number and diameter to balance the cohorts. Average treatment effects on survival with multivariable propensity score-weighted competing risk Cox regression models were evaluated, with BCLC stage, number of treated tumors and liver transplant as additionally controlled variables. Primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS), local tumor control and hepatotoxicity. Treatment-related hepatotoxicity was defined as a 2 point change in CTP within 6 months after treatment. Result(s): 192 subjects were included (101 Ablation, 91 SBRT; median age=60 years, 75% men). Liver disease included HCV (78%), alcohol (35%) and NASH (8%). Liver transplant-adjusted 1- and 2-year OS rates were significantly greater for Ablation vs SBRT (88% vs 75% and 77% vs 50%, P<0.001). 1-and 2-year PFS rates were significantly greater for Ablation vs SBRT (84% vs 65% and 75% vs 51%, P<0.001). 1- and 2- year local tumor control rates were similar with both strategies (99% vs 91% and 94% vs 87%, P=0.298). Propensity score-weighted multivariable analysis showed significantly higher OS (sHR: 2.31, P=0.006) and PFS rates (sHR:1.75, P=0.008) with Ablation compared to SBRT. Ablation was also associated with lower post-treatment hepatotoxicity compared with SBRT (5% vs 12%, P=0.001). Conclusion(s): TACE+Ablation demonstrated higher OS/PFS and lower post-treatment hepatotoxicity compared with TACE+SBRT. Local disease control up to 2-years was equivocal, potentially suggesting equipoise for bridge to transplant.Copyright © 2019",exclusion,Wrong comparator, TACE+ablation vs. TACE + SBRT,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2018.12.233,,,,

A Phase I study in relapsed Ewing's sarcoma. (N = 16) had one 9 month partial response and a two-year survival rate of 44% [1]. Rapid, durable systemic immune activation was seen in the majority of patients using an IFNgamma ELISPOT assay [2]. We seek to extend these early findings in a randomized Phase 2 study (NCT02511132). Method(s): Following surgery (for Vigil manufacture), patients are randomized 1:1 to Vigil (1 x 10 cells/ml by monthly intradermal injection), or to chemotherapy with gemcitabine 675mg/m2 IV D1 and D8 and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV D8 every 21 days. Key eligibility criteria include: Age > 2, histologically documented metastatic Ewing's, refractory or intolerant to >=2 prior lines of chemotherapy, and availability of at least 4 doses of manufactured Vigil. Patients with bone only disease are ineligible. The primary objective is to compare the overall survival of patients treated with Vigil vs. chemotherapy. The sample size of 62 patients assumes a one-year survival rate of 25% in the chemotherapy group vs. 60% in the Vigil group, corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.383 favoring Vigil. Result(s): As of January 2017, thirteen patients have been randomized at 10 centers in the U.S. The design allows for reduction in disease burden prior to surgery using modalities like SBRT and interventional radiology. Toxicity of Vigil has been low compared to chemotherapy. Time to disease progression is being assessed in patients who crossover to Vigil after progressing on chemotherapy. Systemic control of metastatic lesions using cryoablation is also being assessed in other patients (e.g. DSRCT liver metastases) using a separate IND. Conclusion(s): Although associated with systemic immune activation, additional means to reduce disease burden such as SBRT and cryoablation can possibly improve patient health and augment Vigil efficacy.",exclusion,Wrong intervention,,,,,,

Therefore, the authors evaluated the safety and efficacy of SBRT for patients with HCC in a hepatitis B virus-endemic area. METHODS: This multicenter phase 2 trial enrolled patients with unresectable HCC. Patients received SBRT with 45 to 60 Gy in 3 fractions. To evaluate gastroduodenal toxicity, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed before and 2 months after SBRT. The primary endpoint was treatment-related severe toxicity at 1 year after SBRT. The secondary endpoints were the 2-year local control, progression-free survival, and overall survival rates. RESULTS: In total, 74 patients were enrolled between January 2012 and April 2015, and 65 eligible patients were analyzed. One patient experienced radiation-induced liver disease with acute grade ≥3 toxicity 1 month after SBRT. In addition, 1 patient had a grade 3 esophageal ulcer with stenosis 5 months after SBRT. The actuarial rate of treatment-related severe toxicity at 1 year was 3%. The pre-SBRT and post-SBRT EGD findings were not significantly different among the 57 evaluable patients who underwent EGD. The 2-year and 3-year local control rates were 97% and 95%, respectively. The progression-free and overall survival rates were 48% and 84% at 2 years, respectively, and 36% and 76% at 3 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: With a median follow-up of 41 months, this prospective multicenter study demonstrated that SBRT for patients with HCC is well tolerated and is an effective treatment modality.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.1002/cncr.32502,,,,
random-journal.pdf,LivP9,"N., Sebastian",2019,English,LIV.P:#5,A Phase I Trial Evaluating Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy to Induce Hyperemia in Combination with Transarterial Chemoembolization for Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Purpose/Objective(s): Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is indicated in patients with intermediate-stage, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is increasingly being used in HCC. Preclinical studies show that moderate radiation doses (5-10 Gy) induce acute changes in tumor permeability and perfusion. Thus, we hypothesize that SBRT followed by TACE within 24 hours promotes sensitization to TACE. In this prospective phase I trial, we evaluated the feasibility, safety, tolerability, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes associated with single-fraction SBRT followed by TACE within 24 hrs. Materials/Methods: Patients with HCC, 1-3 lesions, Childs-Pugh A/B liver function, and no major vascular invasion were enrolled. The primary objective was to establish the feasibility of single-dose SBRT (7.5 or 10 Gy) followed by TACE within 24 hrs. Secondary endpoints included safety, tolerability, tumor perfusion changes via dynamic-contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI (at 6 or 24 hrs after SBRT), overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), freedom from local progression (FFLP), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Tumor response and progression were graded using modified RECIST criteria. The uni-directional exchange rate constants kep (interstitial space to blood plasma) and kpe (blood plasma to interstitial space) were reported as measures of vascular permeability/perfusion. Result(s): A total of 16 patients were enrolled, and all but one patient received SBRT. Within 24 hours, 13 of these 15 patients successfully underwent TACE. The median age was 64 years (range 48 to 79) and 84.6% of patients were males. Median tumor size was 5.6 cm (range 2.0 to 12.0). Median follow up for living patients is 12.6 months. Crude ORR and CBR are 58% and 75%, respectively. Median OS, PFS, and FFLP are 14.2 months, 6 months, and 5.3 months, respectively. Crude rates of grade 1+ and grade 2+ toxicity are 85% and 38%, respectively. There were no grade 3 or 4 toxicities. One patient died due to TACE-related hemorrhage 4 days after TACE (grade 5). Regarding DCE-MRI metrics, kpe showed a rapid increase within 6 hrs post-SBRT (mean +300.0%, range -6% to +1030%, p=0.01), but a decrease by 24 hrs (mean -34%, range -75% to +17%, p=0.05). A similar trend was also observed for kep, with an increase within 6 hrs post-SBRT (mean +61.3%, range -50% to +218%, p=0.07) and return to near baseline by 24 hrs (mean +21%, range -29% to +155%, p=0.23). Conclusion(s): Single-fraction SBRT followed by TACE within 24 hrs is a feasible and tolerable strategy for intermediate-stage HCC. DCE-MRI analysis revealed significant acute changes in tumor permeability/perfusion after SBRT. Additional studies are needed to establish the safety and efficacy of this combination, and the effects of SBRT on the HCC microenvironment.Copyright © 2019",exclusion,"Other study design, no comparator",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.06.281,,,,

METHODS: An institutional IRB approved phase I clinical trial was conducted. Eligible patients had 1-3 liver metastases measuring less than 5 cm, and no metastases location within 2 cm of the GI tract. Dose escalation was conducted with three dose cohorts. The low, intermediate, and high dose cohorts were planned to receive 36, 48, and 60 respectively to the internal target volume (ITV) in 3 fractions. At least 700 mL of normal liver had to receive <15. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) included acute grade 3 liver, intestinal or spinal cord toxicity or any grade 4 toxicity. The MTD is defined as the dose level below that which results in DLT in 2 or more of the 6 patients in the highest dose level cohort. RESULTS: Nine patients were enrolled (6 male, 3 female): median age 64 years (range, 33-77 years); median gross tumor volume (GTV) 11.1 mL (range, 2.14-89.3 mL); most common primary site, colorectal (5 patients). Four patients had multiple tumors. No patient experienced a DLT and dose was escalated to 60 in 3 fractions without reaching MTD. The only toxicity within 90 days of completion of treatment was one patient with a grade 1 skin hyperpigmentation without tenderness or desquamation. Two patients in the low dose cohort had local recurrence and repeat SBRT was done to previously treated lesions without any toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: Biologically ablative Proton SBRT doses are well tolerated in patients with limited liver metastases with no patients experiencing any grade 2+ acute toxicity.

A phase I trial of nivolumab and ipilimumab in advanced NSCLC demonstrated encouraging activity and manageable toxicity. Irradiation provides palliative and local responses in NSCLC. Increasing evidence suggests that apart from its direct effects, radiotherapy and particularly ablative hypofractionated radiotherapy can act as a trigger for the innate and adaptive immune system termed the abscopal effect. The balance of signals (pro-immunogenic and immunosuppressive) may determine the effectiveness of both systemic antitumor immune responses and local tumor cell killing. Direct tumor debulking by radiation may also be particularly well suited as an adjunct to immunotherapy. In addition, immunotherapy after RT has demonstrated survival benefit. Method(s): This is a phase I study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combination nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks), ipilimumab (1 mg/kg every 6 weeks), and sequential or concurrent SBRT in patients with stage IV NSCLC. Patients will be simultaneously accrued to sequential versus concurrent arms in a randomized 1:1 fashion as first-line therapy. Eligibility criteria include EGFR/ALK negative stage IV disease with PS 0-1. The primary outcome is the safest SBRT dose to various metastatic locations delivered prior to or concurrently with nivolumab and ipilimumab. Metastatic locations include 1)peripheral lung, 2)central lung or mediastinal lymph node, 3)liver, 4)osseous, and 5)abdominal/pelvic with doses ranging 30-50 Gy in 3-5 fractions. Secondary outcomes include toxicity, response rate, progression free survival, tumor microenvironment changes, and immunogenicity of combination therapy. Patients will undergo biopsies pre- and post-SBRT to provide insight into the mechanism of the radiation-induced pro-inflammatory microenvironment. The total sample size will include 40-80 patients depending on the number who contribute to multiple metastatic sites. Twenty patients per randomized arm will be needed to assess the initial starting dose. Result(s): Trial in progress.",exclusion,Other study design,,,,,,

The physical mode of action of NBTXR3 may represent a breakthrough approach for the local treatment of liver cancers, as it does not engage liver and renal functions, i.e. nanoparticles are not metabolized and not excreted by kidney. A phase I/II trial has been implemented for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastasis [NCT02721056]. The study is currently recruiting patients. Method(s): Patients (pts) receive a single intralesional (IL) injection of NBTXR3 (53.3g/L) at Volume levels equivalent to 10%, 15%, 22% and 33% of the baseline tumor volume, followed by RT (SBRT, 45Gy / 3 fractions / 5 to 7 days). For the Phase I part, primary endpoints include determination of the Recommended Dose and Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT). The Phase II part will test three different groups of patients, HCC with portal vein thrombus, HCC without portal vein thrombus and a third cohort with liver metastases. Primary endpoints are complete response rate and safety. Result(s): Enrollment was completed for Volume levels 10% (6 pts) and 15% (4 pts) and is currently recruiting patients at 22% level. The NBTXR3 injections were successful in all cases. Radiotherapy has been delivered as planned without any DLT occurrence. No serious adverse event (SAE) related to NBTXR3 or the treatment procedure occurred. Three adverse events related to the injection were reported and no adverse event related to NBTXR3. Importantly, NBTXR3 nanoparticles did not have any impact on the reliability of image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT). Conclusion(s): The injection of NBTXR3 was safe and well tolerated at these levels. Patients received the planned RT. No DLT occurred. Enrollment is now opened at the 22% level. NBTXR3 shows promising results in terms of safety and antitumor activity and is also currently evaluated in other six clinical studies.",exclusion,"Other study, wrong intervention, no comparator",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2018.36.4-suppl.TPS551,,,,
random-journal.pdf,LivP13,"Bi, Nan",2019,eng,LIV.M:#1;LIV.P:#1,A Phase II Trial of Concurrent Temozolomide and Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Complex Brain Metastases.,"PURPOSE: Complex brain metastases (BMs), such as large lesions, lesions within or close to eloquent locations, or multiple recurrent/progressive BMs, remain the most challenging forms of brain cancer because of decreased intracranial control rates and poor survival. In the present study, we report the results from a single institutional phase II trial of concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) with hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HFSRT) in patients with complex brain metastases, including assessment of its feasibility and toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-four patients with histologically proven primary cancer and complex BMs were enrolled between 2010 and 2015. All the patients were treated with concurrent HFSRT and TMZ (administrated orally at a dosage of 75 mg/m(2) per day for at least 20 days). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 30.6 months. The local control rates at 1 and 2 years were 96% and 82%, respectively. The median OS was 17.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.6-22.2), and the OS rates at 1 and 2 years were 65% (95% CI, 52%-78%) and 33% (19%-47%). Only six patients (15.8%) died of intracranial disease. The median brain metastasis-specific survival was 46.9 months (95% CI, 35.5-58.4). Treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events were rare and included one grade 3 hematological toxicity and two grade 3 liver dysfunctions. CONCLUSION: Treatment using HFSRT concurrent with TMZ was well tolerated and could significantly extend OS compared with historical controls in complex BMs. Large randomized clinical trials are warranted. Trial registration ID: NCT02654106. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The treatment using hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy concurrent with temozolomide appeared to be safe and could significantly extend overall survival compared with historical control in complex brain metastases.

Preclinical studies show that moderate radiation doses induce changes in tumor permeability and perfusion, suggesting an opportunity for TACE sensitization by radiation. In this prospective phase I trial, we evaluated the feasibility, safety, tolerability, response, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes associated with single-fraction SBRT followed by TACE within 24 hours. MATERIALS/METHODS: Patients with HCC, 1-3 lesions, Childs-Pugh A/B liver function, and no major vascular invasion were enrolled. The primary objective was to establish the feasibility of single-dose SBRT (7.5 or 10 Gy) followed by TACE within 24 hours. Secondary endpoints included safety, tolerability, perfusional changes via functional MRI, overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), freedom from local progression (FFLP), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Sixteen patients were enrolled, and 13 received SBRT and TACE. Median follow up was 15.3 months. Best overall ORR and CBR were and 76.9% and 92.3%, respectively. The 1- and 3-month ORR was 76.9% and 69.2%, respectively, and 1- and 3-month CBR was 92.3% and 69.2%, respectively. Median OS, PFS, and FFLP were 14.0, 5.2, and 5.9 months, respectively. Crude rates of grade 1+ and grade 2+ toxicity were 85% and 38%, respectively. No grade 3-4 toxicities were recorded. One grade 5 toxicity occurred due to hemorrhage 4 days after TACE. On dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI, the transfer rate constant from blood plasma to extracellular extravascular space (k(pe)) increased within 6 hours post-SBRT, but decreased by 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesized a strategy of SBRT preceding TACE for the purpose of enhancing TACE delivery and efficacy, and tested this strategy in a small pilot study. We found that single-dose SBRT followed by TACE within 24 hours is feasible and tolerable. DCE-MRI revealed acute changes in tumor permeability/perfusion after SBRT.

Although the addition of reirradiation may improve outcomes compared to chemotherapy alone, significant toxicities limit salvage reirradiation strategies, leading to suboptimal outcomes. We therefore designed a phase 2 protocol to evaluate the efficacy of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) plus cetuximab for rSCCHN. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From July 2007 to March 2013, 50 patients >18 years of age with inoperable locoregionally confined rSCCHN within a previously irradiated field receiving ≥60 Gy, with a Zubrod performance status of 0 to 2, and normal hepatic and renal function were enrolled. Patients received concurrent cetuximab (400 mg/m(2) on day -7 and then 250 mg/m(2) on days 0 and +8) plus SBRT (40-44 Gy in 5 fractions on alternating days over 1-2 weeks). Primary endpoints were 1-year locoregional progression-free survival and National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 graded toxicity. RESULTS: Median follow-up for surviving patients was 18 months (range: 10-70). The 1-year local PFS rate was 60% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 44%-75%), locoregional PFS was 37% (95% CI: 23%-53%), distant PFS was 71% (95% CI: 54%-85%), and PFS was 33% (95% CI: 20%-49%). The median overall survival was 10 months (95% CI: 7-16), with a 1-year overall survival of 40% (95% CI: 26%-54%). At last follow-up, 69% died of disease, 4% died with disease, 15% died without progression, 10% were alive without progression, and 2% were alive with progression. Acute and late grade 3 toxicity was observed in 6% of patients respectively.

The present randomized phase II study aimed to compare 2 SSRS schedules to determine which results the lowest rate of grade 3 or higher protocol-specified adverse events at 4 months. Materials/Methods: Patients with biopsy-proven non-hematogenous malignancy and limited un-irradiated spine metastases not requiring upfront spine surgery were eligible. Patients were randomized to receive either 16 Gy in 1 fraction or 24 Gy in 3 fractions on every other day. This study was designed to detect a protocol-specified adverse event rate > 20% at a 10% significance level (1-sided) and 90% power. Secondary analysis included time to treatment failure, which was defined as presence of grade 3 or higher adverse events or unequivocal local progression of treated spine(s) indicative of re-irradiation or surgical intervention. Designating the preferable of the 2 schedules was based on rules of protocol-specified adverse events and treatment failure rate for each arm. Result(s): Between November 2015 and October 2018, 50 patients (pts) were enrolled for SSRS to 75 metastatic spinal lesions, including 41 lung cancer, 2 breast cancer, 2 head and neck cancer, 2 liver cancer, 2 prostate cancer, and 1 colon cancer. The median age was 62 years old (range 36-79). There were 1 cervical, 41 thoracic, 31 lumbar, and 2 sacral sites for SSRS. Twenty-six patients were randomized to the single-fraction (SF) arm, and 24 patients were randomized to the multi-fraction (MF) arm. The median follow-up time was 11.73 months (range 0.67-39 months). At 4 months, none of the 25 evaluable patients in the SF arm experienced any protocol-specified grade 3 or higher toxicity, but 1 out of the 21 evaluable patients in the MF arm underwent surgical intervention due to progressive compression fracture. During longer follow-up, 2 patients in the SF arm and five additional patients in the MF arm developed treatment failure. The median time to treatment failure was 13.5 months for SF arm, and 8 months for MF arm. The one-year treatment failure rate was significantly worse in the MF arm (SF 5.6% versus MF 14.3%, p=0.04). Conclusion(s): Both SF and MF SSRS seem safe and the SF arm has met its primary endpoint. The interim analysis suggests 16 Gy in single fraction might be the preferable SSRS schedule and warrants longer follow-up as well as further investigation.Copyright © 2019",exclusion,Wrong intervention,,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.06.477,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with ECOG 0-1, Child-Pugh Class A or B, and primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or liver metastases unsuitable for surgical resection or ablation were eligible for a prospective single arm trial. SBRT was delivered with a CyberKnife system to 45 Gy in 3 fractions with a predetermined dose de-escalation scheme. Adverse events, local control, and survival were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients were enrolled. Eleven patients (37%) had HCC and 19 (63%) patients had liver metastases. Fourteen patients (47%) had prior liver-directed therapies including nine with liver resection, seven with trans-arterial chemoembolization, and six with radiofrequency ablation. Cumulative grade 2 and 3 acute toxicity occurred in 47% and 7% of patients, respectively. Similar rates of ≥grade 2 acute toxicity were observed between patients who had prior liver-directed treatments and those who did not. At a median follow-up of 12.7 months, 1-year local control and overall survival were 81% and 62%, respectively. Prior liver-directed therapy did not affect local control or survival.

The most common treatment is TACE, but the best bridging modality is unclear. Recently, SBRT has been shown to be both safe and effiective when used in pts with locally advanced HCC. We prospectively compare SBRT to TACE as a bridge for HCC pts undergoing LT. Method(s): 60 pts planned for accrual. From 9/2014-9/2016, 29 pts within Milan Criteria with C-P Class A/B cirrhosis were randomized to TACE vs. SBRT. TACE pts received 2 treatments one month apart utilizing DEBDOX beads (n = 15). TACE pts were hospitalized after each TACE. Pts receiving SBRT (n = 12) received a median total dose of 45Gy delivered over 5 fractions using fiducials. Mean liver dose, Veff, and NTCP were utilized to determine the prescription dose. Pts were assessed by imaging using mRECIST criteria at 2 months and every 3 months thereafter until LT or death. Toxicity and quality of life were assessed before treatment, during treatment, two weeks post-treatment, and then every three months using the PIQ-6 Pain Impact Questionnaire and the SF-36v2 Health Survey. Primary endpoint was time to retreatment of treated lesion(s). Secondary endpoints include toxicity, pathologic response, radiologic response, number of subsequent treatments, cost, and QOL.

Most data to support locally-directed treatment, such as stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), for oligometastases are from retrospective institutional reports. Following the success of a recently completed and reported phase II trial demonstrating important clinical outcomes, herein we review the current landscape of ongoing clinical trials in this context. Materials and methods: A review of currently activated and registered clinical trials was performed using the clinicaltrials.gov database from inception to February 2019. A search of actively recruiting trials, using the key words oligometastases, SABR, and various related terms was performed. Search results were independently reviewed by two investigators, with discrepancies settled by a third. Data abstracted from identified studies included study type, primary disease site, oncologic endpoints, and inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results: Of the initial 216 entries identified, 64 met our review eligibility criteria after full-text review. The most common study type was a phase II clinical trial (n = 35, 55%) with other study designs ranging from observational registry trials to phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A minority of trials were randomized in design (n = 17, 27%). While most studies allowed for metastases from multiple primary disease sites (n = 22, 34%), the most common was prostate (n = 13, 15%), followed by breast, gastrointestinal, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and renal (n = 6, 9% each). In studies with a solitary target site, the most common was liver (n = 6, 9%) followed by lung (n = 3, 5%). The most common primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) (n = 20, 31%) and toxicity (n = 10, 16%). A combined strategy of systemic therapy and SABR was an emerging theme (n = 23, 36%), with more recent studies specifically evaluating SABR and immunotherapy (n = 9, 14%). Conclusion: The safety and efficacy of SABR as oligometastasis-directed treatment is increasingly being evaluated within prospective clinical trials. These data are awaited to compliment the abundance of existing observational studies and to guide clinical decision-making.",exclusion,Review,"Important, read for more information",10.3389/fonc.2019.00543,,,,

Prior reports of V-effective (Veff), individualized SBRT in liver metastases demonstrate 1- year local control (LC-1) rates exceeding 70%. Protons can potentially allow for higher dose delivery when using an individualized, Veff-based strategy due to lack of exit dose, and thereby, allow for improved local control. In this study we evaluate the efficacy of Veff, individualized proton (P-) SBRT in patients with liver metastases from solid tumors. Materials/Methods: Patients enrolled in an NCI sponsored, single arm, phase 2 study (NCT 01239381). Key eligibility included liver metastases from a solid tumor, absent or limited extrahepatic disease (stable for >3 mo), Child's A or no cirrhosis, ECOG PS 0-2, no prior liver-directed RT and expected survival >3 months. No upper size limit was required, but pts were required to have least 800 mL of uninvolved liver. Patients were treated with 5 P-SBRT treatments. Radiation dose was based on Veff of liver-GTV. Patients with Veff <0.22 received 50 Gy, Veff 0.22-0.50 received 40 Gy, and Veff >0.51 received 30 Gy. Treatments were administered as one daily fraction, 2-3 days per week, over 2 weeks. The trial was designed to demonstrate >70% local control at 1 year with P-SBRT. Result(s): From 2009-2014, 91 pts were enrolled, of whom 90 were analyzed (1 withdrew prior to treatment). Median age was 68 (range, 34-89), 57 (63%) were male; 35 (39%) had colorectal primary, 16 (18%) had pancreatic, 12 (13%) had esophagogastric, 8 (9%) had HCC, 5 (6%) had lung, 3 (3%) had gallbladder, 3 (3%) had breast, 3 (3%) had small bowel or duodenal, 2 (2%) had anal, 2 (2%) had H&N, and 1 (1%) had prostate. Fifty-four pts (60%) had 1 tumor, 21 pts (23%) had 2, 10 pts (11%) had 3, 5 pts (6%) had 4. Median tumor size among 142 of the 146 tumors was 2.55 cm (range, 0.48-11.9). Among the 88 patients with complete tumor size data, 31 (35%) had tumors >5 cm and 7 (8%) had tumors >10 cm. Thirty (33%) pts received 50 Gy, 53 (59%) pts 40 Gy, 7 (8%) pts 30 Gy. No pts developed grade 3 RT-related toxicity. Median follow-up from the start of treatment, among 39 pts still alive, was 11 months (range, 0.3-41 mo). The 1-year LC was 77%, with a mOS of 18 months (95% CI = 14-21) and mPFS of 4 months (95% CI = 3-8). For colorectal patients 1-yr LC was 60%, with a mOS of 18 mo (95% CI = 13-32).

As the prognosis of patients with locally advanced PHC or lymph node metastases in the palliative setting is significantly better compared with patients with organ metastases, ablative therapies may be beneficial. Unfortunately, current ablative options are limited. Photodynamic therapy causes skin phototoxicity and thermal ablative methods, such as stereotactic body radiation therapy and radiofrequency ablation, which are affected by a heat/cold-sink effect when tumours are located close to vascular structures, such as the liver hilum. These limitations may be overcome by irreversible electroporation (IRE), a relatively new ablative method that is currently being studied in several other soft tissue tumours, such as hepatic and pancreatic tumours. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this multicentre phase I/II safety and feasibility study, 20 patients with unresectable PHC due to vascular or distant lymph node involvement will undergo IRE. Ten patients who present with unresectable PHC will undergo CT-guided percutaneous IRE, whereas ultrasound-guided IRE will be performed in 10 patients with unresectable tumours detected at exploratory laparotomy. The primary outcome is the total number of clinically relevant complications (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, score of≥3) within 90 days. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, tumour response, metal stent patency and survival. Follow-up will be 2 years. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol has been approved by the local ethics committees. Data and results will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSION: The Ablation with irreversible eLectroportation in Patients with Advanced perihilar CholangiocarcinomA (ALPACA) study is designed to assess the feasibility of IRE for advanced PHC.

Further reports of outcomes are required to strengthen the level of evidence in the absence of comparative trials evaluating different practical procedures. The aim of this prospective single institutional study is to analyse, in unselected cohort of patients from real-world clinical practice, the long-term survival, tumor control outcomes and safety of SBRT in OD (radical ablative radiotherapy with biological equivalent dose BED10>100 Gy). In addition to standard toxicity and survival parameters, we report unique outcomes as FFWD - Freedom from widespread dissemination, FFNT - Freedom from the need of subsequent treatment and functional survival with Karnofsky performance status higher than 70%. A total of 110 patients were prospectively evaluated, 60% and 40% were treated for lung and liver oligometastatic disease, respectively. No grade 3 or 4 acute toxicities (CTCAE) were reported. With median follow up of 22.2 months and 2-year overall survival of 88.3%, four patients (6.1%) experienced local progression in the lung SBRT cohort. In the liver SBRT cohort, median follow up was 33 months, 2-year overall survival was 68.5% and 11 patients (25%) experienced local and 36 (81.8%) distal progression. Higher BED10 of 150-170 Gy compared to 100-150 Gy was an independent positive prognostic factor for local progression-free survival for all patients with hazard ratio 0.25. This confirms SBRT ablative radiobiology effects to be independent of OD primary histology and location. The best outcomes in terms of FFNT were observed in the multivariable analysis of patients with 1-2 lung OD compared to both the liver OD cohort and patients with more than 2 lung metastases. Better FFNT in the liver SBRT cohort was observed in patients with 1-2 liver metastases and in patients whose liver OD was irradiated by higher BED10. In conclusion, SBRT is a suitable option for patients who are not surgical candidates; with approximately 30% of patients not requiring subsequent treatment 2 years after SBRT. We believe that this treatment represents a safe and effective option for oligometastatic involvement in patients with various primary tumors.",exclusion,Other study design and no comparator,,10.4149/neo_2018_180731N558,,,,
random-journal.pdf,LivP33,,2018,English,#5;LIV.P:#5,Ablative radiotherapy in the treatment of early HCC,"Ablative radiotherapy, so called stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), has been recognized as one of the treatment modalities for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) because of its excellent local control (90%-100% in 3-year) without an increase in severe adverse effects in patients with Child-Pugh score of <=7 for small tumors (<=3 cm). However, according to several guidelines, such as the updated Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Classification (BCLC) and Japanese guidelines, SBRT can be considered alternative treatment modalities for patients with HCC who were ineligible for resection or ablation therapies. Recently, although there have not been prospective randomized study, several investigators reported the comparison of SBRT and other modalities, such as transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and resection, using propensity score matching (PSM) methods. 1) TACE: Sapir E, et al compared SBRT (158 patients) with TACE (112 patients). Although local control of SBRT was significantly better than that of TACE with low toxicities, there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with TACE or SBRT (IJROBP100: 122, 2018). Huo YR, et al. conducted meta-analysis radiation therapy including SBRT plus TACE vs TACE alone, and concluded the pooled median survival for TACE plus RT was significantly better than for TACE alone (22.7 months vs 13.5 months; p < 0.001, respectively) and the benefit of TACE plus RT continuously increased for 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year survival. (JAMA Oncol 6: 756, 2015). 2) RFA: A retrospective study comparing SBRT (63 patients) with RFA (163 patients) suggested a 2-year overall survival and local progression-free survival of about 50% and 80% for both modalities. For tumors >=2 cm, there was decreased local progression-free survival for FA compared with SBRT (p = 0.025). The author concluded that both RFA and SBRT were effective local treatment options for inoperable HCC. (JCO 34: 452, 2016). On the other hand, according to the comparison of RFA (3684 pts) and SBRT (296 pts) from National Cancer Database for stage I-II HCC using PSM, 5-year overall survival was 29.8% in the RFA group vs 19.3% in the SBRT group (p = 0.001). The authors suggests that treatment with RFA yields superior survival compared with SBRT for nonsurgically managed patients with stage I or II HCC. (JCO 36: 600, 2018). 3) Resection: Su TS et al. reported the comparison of SBRT and resection, the 5-year overall survival and progression-free survival was 74.3%, 43.9% in SBRT, 69.3%, 35.9% in resection (p = 0.405, 0.945) with similar toxicities, respectively. (IJROBP 98: 639, 2017). The authors concluded that SBRT has an advantage over resection in being less invasive. On the other hand, according to our institutional ccomparison of resection (54 pts) and SBRT (27 pts) using PSM, 5-overall survival was 75.2% in resection vs 47.8% in SBRT (p = 0.0149). The authors concluded that although SBRT may be an effective alternative treatment for inoperable patients with early HCC, resection should be considered as the first-line treatment for patients deemed eligible for surgery. (unpublished data). These comparisons are retrospective nature, further prospective trials, especially comparison of overall survival between SBRT and other modalities for untreated HCC patients, are needed before SBRT can become a true competitor of the other modalities, such as TACE, RFA and resection.",exclusion,Not systematic review of the literature,Very interesting review to check for studies,http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000490877,,,,

Materials: The most recent version of the National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried for adult patients diagnosed with AJCC stage 1-3 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) between 2004-2016. Patients receiving surgical resection of metastatic sites were excluded. HCC treatment was stratified as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT; defined as beam-based radiotherapy). Kaplan-Meier plots, log rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate overall survival. Propensity score matching was utilized to account for potential confounders, separately for stage 1 and stage 2/3 disease. Result(s): A total of 13,030 patients met inclusion criteria, of whom n = 10,517 (80.6%) received RFA and n = 2531 (19.4%) SRT. Median SRT radiation dose was 44 Gy (IQR: 30-50 Gy) over a median of 5 fractions (IQR: 3-11 fractions). Patients treated with SRT were more commonly older whites with Medicare insurance and low comorbidities compared to RFA. SRT was less common for stage 1 HCC compared to RFA (48.3% vs. 67.7%, P <0.001) and for larger HCC (median size, 40 vs. 26 mm, P <0.001). HCC treatment via SRT was more common in East North Central and Middle Atlantic States. Annual case numbers for both treatment modalities increased from 2004-2016. After propensity score matching RFA to SRT for stage 1 HCC, a matched cohort with n = 1,868 patients was obtained with balanced confounders between both treatment modalities. Overall survival was evident for RFA vs. SRT in the matched cohort (HR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.59-0.75, P <0.001). Comparable results were obtained for stage 2/3 HCC after propensity score matching (n = 1,694 patients, RFA vs. SRT HR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.55-0.69, P <0.001). Conclusion(s): A majority of patients with non-surgically treated HCC receive RFA that shows superior overall survival versus stereotactic radiotherapy.Copyright © 2020",exclusion,Wrong comparator,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2019.12.558,,,,
random-journal.pdf,LivP35,"Winter, Jeff D",2015,eng,LIV.P:#5,Accuracy of Robotic Radiosurgical Liver Treatment Throughout the Respiratory Cycle.,"PURPOSE: To quantify random uncertainties in robotic radiosurgical treatment of liver lesions with real-time respiratory motion management. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 27 liver cancer patients treated with robotic radiosurgery over 118 fractions. The robotic radiosurgical system uses orthogonal x-ray images to determine internal target position and correlates this position with an external surrogate to provide robotic corrections of linear accelerator positioning. Verification and update of this internal-external correlation model was achieved using periodic x-ray images collected throughout treatment. To quantify random uncertainties in targeting, we analyzed logged tracking information and isolated x-ray images collected immediately before beam delivery. For translational correlation errors, we quantified the difference between correlation model-estimated target position and actual position determined by periodic x-ray imaging. To quantify prediction errors, we computed the mean absolute difference between the predicted coordinates and actual modeled position calculated 115 milliseconds later. We estimated overall random uncertainty by quadratically summing correlation, prediction, and end-to-end targeting errors. We also investigated relationships between tracking errors and motion amplitude using linear regression. RESULTS: The 95th percentile absolute correlation errors in each direction were 2.1 mm left-right, 1.8 mm anterior-posterior, 3.3 mm cranio-caudal, and 3.9 mm 3-dimensional radial, whereas 95th percentile absolute radial prediction errors were 0.5 mm. Overall 95th percentile random uncertainty was 4 mm in the radial direction. Prediction errors were strongly correlated with modeled target amplitude (r=0.53-0.66, P<.001), whereas only weak correlations existed for correlation errors. CONCLUSIONS: Study results demonstrate that model correlation errors are the primary random source of uncertainty in Cyberknife liver treatment and, unlike prediction errors, are not strongly correlated with target motion amplitude. Aggregate 3-dimensional radial position errors presented here suggest the target will be within 4 mm of the target volume for 95% of the beam delivery.",exclusion,"Wrong intervention, no comparator",,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2015.08.031,,,,

This may result in high rates of acute toxicity or the need to reduce the dose below levels required for tumor ablation. AMR‐SBRT may improve the therapeutic ratio using daily reoptimization to account for variation in tumor/OAR anatomy. We report results of the first prospective trial investigating the role of AMRSBRT in decreasing acute toxicity while maintaining an ablative dose for abdominal malignancies. Materials/Methods: Eighteen patients with oligometastatic or unresectable primary abdominal malignancy, enrolled in a prospective phase I study (NCT02264886) from 2/2015 to 12/2015, underwent AMR‐SBRT using a commercially available, integrated MR‐IGRT unit. Treated sites included the liver (5 metastatic, 3 HCC, 1 IHC) and non‐liver abdomen (5 pancreas, 4 oligometastatic). The prescription was 50 Gy/5 fractions (goal of 95% PTV coverage), subject to strict maximum point dose (0.5cc) constraints for abdominal OAR including stomach (<33 Gy), duodenum (<35 Gy) and small bowel (<30 Gy). During each fraction, physician segmentation of a daily volumetric MR was performed. The initial plan was applied to daily anatomy to evaluate for OAR constraint violation, or if dose escalation (DE) beyond 10 Gy/fraction was possible while maintaining OAR constraints. If either criterion existed, online reoptimization, QA, and delivery of a new plan were performed while the patient remained on the table. Quality of life (QOL) via the EORTC QLQ‐C30 was recorded pre‐treatment and at 6 weeks and 6 months posttreatment. Local freedom from progression (LFFP) was evaluated by RECIST criteria. Results: All patients tolerated therapy, with a median on‐table time of 77 minutes. Each patient received 31 adapted fraction and 83% of fractions were adapted. Indications for adaptation included OAR constraint violation (n = 68), DE (n = 3), or both (n = 1). When DE was possible (n = 12), median dose per fraction was 15 Gy. LFFP by RECIST criteria at 3 months was 88% (n = 17). Median follow‐up was 6.3 months. There were no grade 3 toxicities at 6 weeks or 3 months. There was no change in pretreatment and 6‐week global QOL scores (P = 0.23); 6‐month QOL, LFFP, and survival data have not yet matured. Conclusion: AMR‐SBRT is feasible, allowing for dose escalation and/or OAR sparing with low toxicity and promising efficacy. Daily imaging revealed motion of the GI tract that frequently required re‐planning to avoid constraint violation. A phase II randomized controlled trial is planned to compare toxicity and QOL between AMR‐SBRT and SBRT delivered without online adaptive planning.",exclusion,"Other study design, no comparator",,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2016.06.1108,,,,

The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of SBRT for lung and liver oligo-recurrent lesions and evaluate predictive factors for local control and prognosis. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients who presented with 1-3 matachronous lung or liver metastases, and treated with SBRT between May 2013 and March 2016 at a single institution. All patients harbored a controlled primary lesion. Patients with < 6 months of follow-up were excluded. Local control, progression free survival, and overall survival rates were analyzed according to the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. Univariable log-rank and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to clarify predictive factors for local control and prognosis. Toxicity was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients with a total of 70 and 44 lung and liver lesions were included. The median follow-up period was 21 (range, 7-43) months. The 1-year local control, progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 89, 38 and 96%, respectively. Smaller gross tumor volume and additional chemotherapy after SBRT were significant predictive factors for better local control (p = 0.005 and p = 0.047), and the presence of a single metastatic lesion was a significant factor of good progression free survival (p = 0.008). Additional chemotherapy after SBRT was not a significant predictive factor but conferred to better overall survival (p = 0.078). Among colorectal cancer patients, post SBRT chemotherapy was significantly associated with better OS (p = 0.025). Over grade 3 adverse event was seen in only one patient. CONCLUSION: SBRT is a safe and effective treatment for patients with lung and liver oligo-recurrence. Additional chemotherapy after SBRT improved local control, and single metastatic lesion was a significant predictive factor of better PFS in this study. Among colorectal cancer patients, additional chemotherapy after SBRT significantly associated better OS.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.1186/s13014-018-1031-0,,,,

The trial was aimed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 5 fractions SBRT treatment Material and Methods The clinical trial design was very articulated including seven arms (Table). Each patient was sequentially enrolled in a given study arm, according to tumor site and clinical stage. The total dose, prescribed to the target isocenter (ICRU 62), ranged from 20 to 50 Gy (biologic effective dose=28-100 Gy, alpha/beta=10) according to different arms of the protocol; the doses per fraction ranged from 4 to 10 Gy along 5 days. Dose escalation was based primarily on acute and subacute toxicity because late toxicity can occur months or years later. Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) were defined as any treatmentrelated non haematological adverse effects rated as Grade > 3 or any haematological toxicity rated as > 4 by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria. The maximum tolerable dose has been reached if one third of patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity. Preliminary data about acute toxicity and late toxicity, tumor response and early local control were investigated and reported Results 282 consecutive patients (M/F: 166/116; median age: 69, range 35-90) with 376 lesions were treated. Of these, 119 were primary or metastatic lung tumors, 13 were metastatic liver tumors and 188 were nodal metastases. Median follow-up was 19 months (2-157). Maximum tolerated dose was defined in 4 (a, b, c and f) of the 7 arms of the study, while recruitment of other arms (d, e, g) is still ongoing (Table). Grade 2 acute toxicity rate was 5.6%. Overall response rate was 82.2 % (CI 95%: 77.2- 86.3) with a complete response rate of 58.8% (CI 95%: 52.8-64.4). 12-and 24-months actuarial local control (freedom from progression in the irradiated site) were 84.3% and 73.7%, respectively. Four patients (all previously irradiated in the same site) had severe (>grade 3) late toxicity Conclusion SBRT delivered in 5 consecutive fractions up to the doses evaluated in the first part of this trial is well tolerated.

Studies investigating this association for patients undergoing resection of bone metastases are scarce and controversial. PURPOSE: We assessed (1) whether exposure to perioperative allogeneic blood transfusions was associated with decreased survival after surgery for spinal metastases and (2) if there was a dose-response relationship per unit of blood transfused. Additionally, we explored the risk factors associated with survival after surgery for spinal metastases. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This is a retrospective cohort study from two university medical centers. PATIENT SAMPLE: There were 649 patients who had operative treatment for metastatic disease of the spine between 2002 and 2014. Patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma were also included. We excluded patients with a revision procedure, kyphoplasty, vertebroplasty, and radiosurgery alone. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measure was survival after surgery. The date of death was obtained from the Social Security Death Index and medical charts. METHODS: Blood transfusions within 7 days before and 7 days after surgery were considered perioperative. A multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the relationship between allogeneic blood transfusion as exposure versus non-exposure, and subsequently as continuous value; we accounted for clinical, laboratory, and treatment factors. RESULTS: Four hundred fifty-three (70%) patients received perioperative blood transfusions, and the median number of units transfused was 3 (interquartile range: 2-6). Exposure to perioperative blood transfusion was not associated with decreased survival after accounting for all explanatory variables (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.80-1.31; p=.841). Neither did we find a dose-response relationship (HR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.98-1.04; p=.420). Other factors associated with worse survival were older age, more severe comorbidity status, lower preoperativehemoglobin level, higher white blood cell count, higher calcium level, primary tumor type, previous systemic therapy, poor performance status, presence of lung, liver, or brain metastasis, and surgical approach. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative allogeneic blood transfusions were not associated with decreased survival after surgery for spinal metastases. More liberal transfusion policies might be warranted for patients undergoing surgery for spinal metastasis, although careful consideration is needed as other complications may occur.",exclusion,,,10.1016/j.spinee.2016.03.043,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In total, 60 patients, 40 with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 20 with cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), were treated with SBRT. Liver function panels were obtained before and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after SBRT. Laboratory values were censored after locoregional recurrence, further liver-directed therapies, or liver transplant. RESULTS: A significant decline in hepatic function occurred after SBRT for HCC patients only (P = .001 by ALBI score; P < .0001 by CP score). By converting radiation doses to biologically equivalent doses by using a standard linear quadratic model using α/β of 10, the strongest dosimetric predictor of liver function decline for HCC was the volume of normal liver irradiated by a dose of 40 Gy when assessing liver function by the ALBI score (P = .07), and the volume of normal liver irradiated by a dose of 20 Gy by using the CP score (P= .0009). For CCA patients, the volume of normal liver irradiated by a dose of 40 Gy remained the strongest dosimetric predictor when using the ALBI score (P = .002), but no dosimetric predictor was significant using the CP score. Hepatic function decline correlated with worse overall survival for HCC (by ALBI, P = .0005; by CP, P < .0001) and for CCA (by ALBI, P = NS; by CP, P = .008). CONCLUSIONS: ALBI score was similarly able to predict hepatic function decline compared with CP score, and both systems correlated with survival.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.1016/j.prro.2016.10.003,,,,

In a previous pilot cohort, we demonstrated that Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) significantly increases lung volume, reduces tumor motion, distancing the heart from the chest wall, and reduces radiation exposure to normal tissues. Here we report the dosimetric benefit and safety results of expanded cohort of this prospective clinical trial of CPAP in radiotherapy. Materials/Methods: This IRB approved clinical trial was conducted between December 2013 and 2016, NCT02324530. Inclusion criteria included adult patients with primary or secondary lung tumors, left sided breast cancer and liver metastases referred for RT. Following informed consent and brief training, subjects underwent 4D simulation twice: without CPAP (free-breathing (FB)) and with CPAP. PTV was created by 0.5 cm expansion of the ITV. Treatment was planned using a programming interface AAA algorithm on both simulations. Volumetric and dosimetric parameters were compared with Student's test (categorical variables) and linear regression (continuous variables). Toxicity was reported according to CTCAE V4. Result(s): 49 patients were recruited. 6 patients withdrew consent prior to simulation, 3 subjects withdrew due to CPAP mask discomfort. Complete comparative volumetric data with and without CPAP was available for 40 patients, and dosimetric comparison was available for 24 patients for whom treatment plans were prepared on both simulations. Mean age 62 (range 31-86), median ECOG: 0 (range 0-3), 28 patients were treated with SBRT and 12 with standard fractionation. 20 patients treated for single lesions and 20 patients multiple lesions. Ultimately, 27 patients were treated with CPAP and 13 with FB. Median lung volume increased to 3909 cc vs 2915 cc, relative increase of 37% (p< 0.001). Increased lung volume with CPAP was independent of age, BMI, gender, COPD, smoking status and heart disease. Tumor motion was decreased as reflected in a median reduction of PTV by 19% (p<0.001). Mean lung dose by reduced by 15%, bilateral lung V20 by 20%, lung V5 by 11%, heart V5 by 16% (p<0.01 for all). All patients treated with CPAP tolerated the intervention without complications. Grade 2 pneumonitis was reported in 4/40 patients (cough), grade 3/40 pneumonitis in 1/40 patient, rib fractures in 3/40 patients, and grade 2 esophagitis in 4/40 patients. Conclusion(s): In this prospective clinical trial, the largest to date, use of CPAP was associated with significant geometric, volumetric, and dosimetric benefits compared to free breathing. CPAP was safe and well tolerated by most patients, and reduces radiation exposure to normal organs.Copyright © 2019",exclusion,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.06.432,,,,

METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 2 centers in Hong Kong. There were 49 patients who had TACE + SBRT and 202 patients who had TACE alone. Propensity score matching was used to adjust for differences in patients' demographics and tumor characteristics between the 2 groups. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS) and secondary outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS) and treatment-related toxicity. RESULTS: After matching, 49 patients were in the TACE + SBRT group and 98 patients in the TACE group with similar baseline characteristics. The 1-&3-year OS were better in TACE + SBRT group (67.2 vs. 43.9% and 36.5 vs. 13.3%, p = 0.003). The 1-&3-year PFS was also better in TACE + SBRT group (32.5 vs. 21.4% and 15.1 vs. 5.1%, p = 0.012). Radiological disease control was better in the TACE + SBRT group (98 vs. 56.7%). Risk of severe toxicity was uncommon in both treatment arms. TACE + SBRT was an independent good prognostic factor for OS and PFS in multivariate analysis, whereas AFP>200 ng/ml, large tumor and multiple tumors predicted worse OS. CONCLUSION: TACE + SBRT is safe and results in better survivals in nonresectable HCC patients.",inclusion,,SBRT+TACE vs TACE and retrospective,10.1016/j.suronc.2019.01.006,,,,

Methods: This study is designed as a mono‐center study. The participants are randomized into three group, and received the following recommended schedule: 49Gy/7f, 54Gy/6f and 55Gy/5f with BED10 in correspondence to 83.3Gy, 102.6Gy and 115.5Gy. The primary outcome measures are to calculate local control rates (LC), overall survival rates (OS) and progression‐free survival rates (PFS). The secondary outcome measures are to observe radiation‐induced liver injury (RILD) rates, Child‐Pugh score and indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (ICG‐R15) value before and after CK‐SBRT. Moreover, gastrointestinal toxicities are also observed. Discussion: There is no uniform standard for CK‐SBRT dose schedule of hepatocellular carcinoma.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2011 and 2016, a total of 198 patients with 280 lung, liver, and abdominal tumors were treated with BMC-SBRT. The median gross tumor volume (GTV) was 12.3 cc (0.1-372.0 cc). Medians of mean GTV BED(α/β =)(10) (Gy) (BED = biological effective dose) was 148.5 Gy(10) (31.5-233.3 Gy(10)) and prescribed planning target volume (PTV) BED(α/β =)(10) (Gy) was 89.7 Gy(10) (28.8-151.2 Gy(10)), respectively. We analyzed overall survival (OS) and local control (LC) based on various factors, including BEDs with α/β ratios of 15 Gy (lung metastases), 21 Gy (primary lung tumors), and 27 Gy (liver metastases). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 10.4 months (2.0-59.0 months). The 2‑year actuarial LC was 100 and 86.4% for primary early and advanced stage lung tumors, respectively, 100% for lung metastases, 82.2% for liver metastases, and 90% for extrapulmonary extrahepatic metastases. The 2‑year OS rate was 47.9% for all patients. In uni- and multivariate analysis, comparatively lower PTV prescription dose (equivalence of 3 × 12-13 Gy) and higher average GTV dose (equivalence of 3 × 18 Gy) to current practice were significantly associated with LC. For OS, Karnofsky performance score (100%), gender (female), and SBRT without simultaneous chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors. Grade 3 side effects were rare (0.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Robotic guided BMC-SBRT can be considered a safe and effective treatment for solid tumors in moving organs. To reach sufficient local control rates, high average GTV doses are necessary. Further prospective studies are warranted to evaluate these points.",exclusion,,,10.1007/s00066-017-1204-z,,,,
random-journal.pdf,LivP50,"Nakayama, Y",2017,English,LIV.M:#5;LIV.P:#5,Carbon-ion therapy,"Introduction: Approximately 68 particle therapy facilities are in operation worldwide. Among them, only 11 offer carbon-ion treatment (5 in Japan, 2 in Germany, 2 in China, 1 in Italy, and 1 in Austria; 6 also offer proton), and the remainder offer proton treatment. More than 150,000 patients have been treated with particle therapy worldwide from 1954 to 2015, 87% of which were treated with protons and 13% with carbon-ions or other particles (from the website of the Particle Therapy Co-Operative Group: http://www.ptcog.ch/). The National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS) in Chiba, Japan, has been treating cancer with high-energy carbon-ions since 1994. The majority of patients curatively treated with carbon-ions worldwide were treated at NIRS.1 Through the data they have generated, carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been suggested as safe and efficacious. Here, I review those results and discuss this modern technology. Characteristics of CIRT In comparison with photon radiotherapy, CIRT has better dose distribution to tumors while simultaneously minimizing dose to surrounding normal tissues. Moreover, CIRT offers potential advantages over protons, which have similar dose distribution benefits. Carbon-ions provide a better physical dose distribution, because lateral scattering is lessened, and offer a higher relative biological effectiveness with a lower oxygen enhancement ratio; desirable features for eradication of radioresistant, hypoxic tumors. This difference between densely ionizing nuclei and sparsely ionizing x-rays/protons further offers potential radiobiological advantages, such as reduced repair capacity in irradiated tumors, decreased cell-cycle dependence, and possibly stronger immunological responses. CIRT of early NSCLC Surgical resection with lobectomy has been the standard treatment of choice for early-stage NSCLC. From a Japanese lung cancer registry study of 11,663 surgical cases in 2004, overall survival (OS) rates at 5 years for stages IA and IB disease were 82.0% and 66.8%, respectively.2 Radiotherapy is an option for patients who are not suitable for surgery or refuse it. Recently, hypofractionated radiotherapy is regarded as an alternative for surgery in cases of localized NSCLC, employing x-ray stereotactic body radiotherapy, protons, or CIRT. Regarding CIRT, for peripheral stage I NSCLC, the number of fractions delivered per treatment at NIRS has been reduced through consecutive trials from 18 to 9, then 4, and finally to a single fraction.3-7 This latest result, conducted via dose escalation study, was recently reported by NIRS, demonstrating results comparable to those with previous fractionated regimens.8 The Japan Carbon-ion Radiation Oncology Study Group (J-CROS) has further reported that the results of a multi-institutional retrospective study of CIRT for stage I NSCLC were similar with the results of previous single institutional reports.9 The results of CIRT in stage IA NSCLC are similar to the best stereotactic body radiotherapy results reported worldwide. For stage IB disease, CIRT results appear tentatively superior to those reported for photon stereotactic body radiotherapy in terms of local control and lung toxicity, but will require randomized controlled trials to verify. Despite this high local control, however, disease-specific survival is much lower in stage IB than in stage IA, due to distant metastatic recurrence. A combination of CIRT with systemic therapy is therefore essential to improve survival. CIRT demonstrates a better dose distribution than both SBRT and proton therapy in most cases of early-stage lung cancer. Therefore, CIRT may be safer for treating patients with adverse conditions such as large tumors, central tumors, and poor pulmonary function. CIRT of locally advanced NSCLC There has only been one report regarding CIRT for locally advanced NSCLC. A prospective nonrandomized phase I/II study of carbon-ion therapy in a favorable subset of locally advanced NSCLC was reported from NIRS.10 They showed that short-course carbon-ion monotherapy (72GyE/16Fr) was associated with manageable toxicity and encouraging local control rates. Among them, cT3-4N0M0 patients were particularly favorable candidates for CIRT. However, there is a relative dearth of evidence for CIRT in the setting of locally advanced NSCLC, and more trials, including those combined with systemic immunological or chemotherapy agents, are required. Future Directions: We have organized a multi-institutional study group of carbon-ion radiation oncology in Japan (J-CROS) and have been conducting a number of trials involving a multitude of tumor sites. A number are emerging as particularly attractive for CIRT with possibility of new levels of achievable disease control, including in NSCLC, head and neck cancer, locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, locally recurrent rectal cancer, as well as others. The outcomes of CIRT for stage I NSCLC in Japanese multi-institutional datasets were retrospectively analyzed. As a result, CIRT is considered a low-risk and effective treatment option for patients with stage I NSCLC. Confirmative multiinstitutional prospective studies via J-CROS began last year, so as to validate these results.",exclusion,,,,,,,

Recently, hypofractionated radiotherapy is regarded as an alternative to surgery for localized NSCLC, using x-ray stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) or particle therapy using protons or carbon-ions. With regard to CIRT, for peripheral stage I NSCLC, the number of fractions was reduced in different trials from 18 to 9, then 4, and finally to a single fraction at NIRS (Table). The results with CIRT in stage IA NSCLC are similar to the best SBRT results reported worldwide. For stage IB disease, CIRT results appear superior to those reported for photon SBRT in terms of local control and lung toxicity.

Among them, cT3- 4N0M0 patients were good candidates for CIRT. There is otherwise a lack of evidence currently for CIRT for locally advanced NSCLC, and more study is needed. Moreover, concurrent systemic therapy is essential to improve survival for locally advanced NSCLC. Future directions: We organized a multi-institutional study group of carbon-ion radiation oncology in Japan (J-CROS). This group is currently conducting trials on several tumor sites which are thought to be most attractive for CIRT, including NSCLC, head and neck disease, locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, locally recurrent rectal cancer, and others. The outcomes of CIRT for stage I NSCLC at all Japanese carbon centers were pooled and retrospectively analyzed. Consequently, CIRT may be considered a low-risk and effective treatment option for patients with stage I NSCLC. J-CROS has now begun a confirmatory multi-institutional prospective study to confirm these results.",exclusion,,,,,,,

METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) from 2004-2014 on patients with non-metastatic HCC. Treatment modalities assessed were surgical resection, transplantation, ablation, radioembolization, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), single-agent chemotherapy, and multi-agent chemotherapy. Facilities were dichotomized at the median of the listed treatment modalities. RESULTS: There were a total of 112,512 patients with non-metastatic HCC. Of a total of 1,230 sites, 830 (67.5%) used four or fewer modalities. Average survival for patients treated at facilities using fewer modalities was 12.0 and 23.5 months for those treated at facilities with more modalities [hazard ratio (HR) =0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.51-0.53, P<0.001]. After adjusting for facility volume, liver function, tumor and patient characteristics and other prognostic factors in a multivariable Cox model, treatment at a multi-modality facility still provided a survival advantage (HR =0.60, 95% CI: 0.52-0.70, P<0.001). This benefit also persisted after propensity score matching. Sensitivity analysis varying the cut point from 2 to 6 modalities for dichotomization showed that the benefit persisted. Subgroup stratified analyses based on stage showed that the benefit in OS was highest for patients with stage I and II (P≤0.002) but was not significant for stage III or IVa.

METHODS: We reviewed the treatment and outcomes of all patients who received SBRT for primary liver cancer (PLC) and metastatic liver tumors between July 2004 and November 2015 at our institution. The cHBT was defined as isotropic expansions (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25mm) from the portal vein (PV). Doses were converted to biologically effective doses by using the standard linear quadratic model with α/β of 10 (BED(10)). HBT was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 13months. Out of the 130 patients with complete follow-up records analyzed, 60 (46.1%) had liver metastases, 40 (30.8%) had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 26 (20%) had cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and 4 (3.1%) patients other PLC histologies. Thirty-three (25.4%) grade 2+ and 28 (21.5%) grade 3+ HBT were observed. Grade 3+ HBT was seen in 13 patients (50%) with CCA, 7 patients (17.5%) with HCC and 7 (11.7%) patients with liver metastases. SBRT doses to the cHBT were highly associated with HBT, but only for PLC patients when analyzed by histological subtype. The 15mm expansion from the PV (cHBT(15)) proved to be an appropriate surrogate for the cHBT. The strongest cHBT(15) dose predictors for G3+ HBT for PLC were the V(BED10)40⩾37cc (p<0.0001) and the V(BED10)30⩾45cc (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: SBRT doses to the cHBT are associated with occurrence of HBT only in PLC patients. Limiting the dose to the cHBT to V(BED10)40<37cc and V(BED10)30<45cc when treating PLC patients with SBRT may reduce the risk of HBT.",exclusion,,,10.1016/j.radonc.2016.10.024,,,,

Method(s): Between January 2015 and April 2016, consecutive patients with unresectable hepatic lesions (hepatocellular cancer (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) or liver metastasis) who received either conventional or stereotactic radiation (SBRT) were included. All patients were required to have Child Pugh status B7 or less prior to hepatic radiation. Total liver volume, gross tumour volume (GTV), normal liver volume (total liver volume-GTV) was determined. First follow-up scans were used to determine changes, if any, in liver volume. As the dose prescription of each patient was individualised, biologically equivalent dose (BED) was calculated. Univariate analysis (Fisher's exact test) was carried out to determine correlation if any between liver volume changes and total dose, GTV at treatment, use of systemic chemotherapy, primary tumour type, baseline liver function status, age and viral marker status. P P<0.05 was considered significant. Result(s): 13 patients received either SBRT or concurrent chemoradiation. Of these 6/7 patients with HCC received TACE prior to RT initiation and all received sorafenib whereas 3/4 with CCA received gemcitabine and cisplatin concurrently with radiation. All patients were Child A prior to initiation of treatment. The patient data are shown in Table 1. On univariate analysis, only the amount of normal liver volume at baseline showed significance (P=0.005), with the larger the volume present, the more the volume loss. Other patient and treatment related factors did not impact liver volume changes.

The aim of the work is to evaluate the effectiveness of stereotactic radiosurgery performed on LINAC linear accelerator and the occurrence of postoperative complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with ciliary body melanoma treated with stereotactic radiosurgery on linear accelerator in the period 1/2011 to 12/2016 in Slovakia. RESULTS: From 1/2011 to 12/2016 a group of 27 patients with melanoma of the ciliary body underwent one day session stereotactic radiosurgery irradiation on linear accelerator (SRCH). Primary enucleation was indicated in 10 (37 %) patients. A group of 17 (63 %) patients were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery. In a group of 17 patients indicated for SRCH, 7 (41 %) were diagnosed in T1 stage, 8 (47 %) in T2 stage. In 2 (12 %) patients who refused primary enucleation, palliative irradiation was indicated in T3 stage, and later metastases appeared in liver and systemic chemotherapy was indicated. The therapeutic dose in all patients was TD 35 Gy, TD max 42 Gy. The mean age of patients at the time of irradiation was 60.8, the youngest patient was 40 and the oldest was 80 years old. The follow-up period was 12 months to 5 years. CONCLUSION: Currently, in Slovakia, the only irradiation possibility to treat ciliary body melanoma is stereotactic radiosurgery.

We sought to identify prognostic criteria in oligometastatic patients undergoing definitive hypofractionated image-guided radiotherapy (HIGRT). METHODS: Exclusively extracranial oligometastatic patients treated with HIGRT were pooled. Characteristics including age, sex, primary tumor type, interval to metastatic diagnosis, number of treated metastases and organs, metastatic site, prior systemic therapy for primary tumor treatment, prior definitive metastasis-directed therapy, and systemic therapy for metastasis associated with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and treated metastasis control (TMC) were assessed by the Cox proportional hazards method. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) identified prognostic risk strata for OS and PFS based on pretreatment factors. RESULTS: 361 patients were included. Primary tumors included non-small cell lung (17%), colorectal (19%), and breast cancer (16%). Three-year OS was 56%, PFS was 24%, and TMC was 72%. On multivariate analysis, primary tumor, interval to metastases, treated metastases number, and mediastinal/hilar lymph node, liver, or adrenal metastases were associated with OS. Primary tumor site, involved organ number, liver metastasis, and prior primary disease chemotherapy were associated with PFS. OS RPA identified five classes: class 1: all breast, kidney, or prostate cancer patients (BKP) (3-year OS 75%, 95% CI 66-85%); class 2: patients without BKP with disease-free interval of 75+ months (3-year OS 85%, 95% CI 67-100%); class 3: patients without BKP, shorter disease-free interval, ≤ two metastases, and age < 62 (3-year OS 55%, 95% CI 48-64%); class 4: patients without BKP, shorter disease-free interval, ≥ three metastases, and age < 62 (3-year OS 38%, 95% CI 24-60%); class 5: all others (3-year OS 13%, 95% CI 5-35%). Higher biologically effective dose (BED) (p < 0.01) was associated with OS.

In this secondary analysis, we sought to identify clinical and molecular predictors of local failure. Materials/Methods: Patients were enrolled on an NCI sponsored, prospective, multi-institutional, single arm phase 2 study (NCT 01239381). Key eligibility were ECOG PS 0-2, age 18+, 1-4 liver metastases, and expected survival >3 months. There was no upper size limit; however, pts must have >=800 cm3 of uninvolved liver. Patients were treated with proton beam RT in 5 fractions to a total dose of 30-50 GyE, with individualized dose prescription based on dose received by non-target liver. Eligible patients from this phase 2 study formed the basis of this secondary analysis. Clinical/treatment characteristics evaluated include primary disease site (colorectal vs. pancreaticobiliary vs esophagogastric vs other), histology (adenocarcinoma vs SCC vs other), disease status at consent (progressing on chemo vs stable/ responding), number of lesions treated, sum of the longest tumor diameters and RT dose. Mutational analysis was performed with a multiplexed clinical assay on nucleic acid from formalin-fixed tissue (SNaPshot), which tests for >150 mutations across 15 commonly mutated cancer genes. Cox proportional hazards models were performed to evaluate associations of these study variables on local control. Result(s): From 2009-2014, 91 patients were enrolled into the study, of whom 90 were analyzed. With a median follow-up of 11 months (range, 0.3-41), the 1-year local control was 77%. Local control did not differ with respect to: primary disease site (P = .242); histology (P = .534); disease status at consent (P=.483); number of lesions treated (P=.786), sum of the longest tumor diameters (P = .167), or RT dose (P = .699). Mutational analysis was performed on 64 of the 90 patients. Among them, the following were present: 31 (48%) had no mutations found; 15 (23%) KRAS; 0 (0%) BRAF; 1 (2%) NRAS; 5 (8%) PIK3CA; 13 (20%) TP53, 3 (5%) HER2; 1 (2%) RET, 1 (2%) EGFR; and 1 (2%) MET. Presence of a KRAS mutation conferred a significantly higher risk of local failure among treated lesions compared to tumors without KRAS mutation (HR = 3.3, P = .006). One-year local control among patients with and without KRAS mutations were 39% and 79%, respectively. Neither presence of the PIK3CA mutation (P = .883) nor TP53 mutation (P = .111) were associated with local control. Conclusion(s): In our prospective phase 2 study of SBRT for liver metastases, KRAS mutant tumors had significantly higher rates of local failure compared tumors without KRAS mutations. Liver metastases with KRAS mutations treated with SBRT may benefit from further dose-escalation or other strategies.",exclusion,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2009 to 2015, 47 lesions from 28 patients were treated with SABR and retrospectively analyzed. All patients had oligometastatic (93%) or oligoprogressive (7%) disease. Primary cancer diagnoses were 15 ovarian, 8 endometrial, 2 cervical, 2 vaginal, and 1 uterine carcinosarcoma. Treatment was delivered using a median of 5 fractions to a median total dose of 40 Gy. Targets were grouped by treatment site and assessed for response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1. Mean biologically effective dose and pre-SABR tumor size were compared with response. Progression-free survival (PFS) was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis, and toxicity outcomes were graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 12.8 months. Target locations were 17% liver, 21% lung, 17% paraaortic node, 26% other node, and 19% pelvic soft tissue. After treatment, 34% of targets were stable (SD), 32% had a partial response (PR), 17% had a complete response (CR), and 17% had progressive disease (PD). No failures occurred in lung or nodal targets. Mean ± standard deviation pre-SABR tumor diameter was 24 ± 22 mm. There was a significant difference in mean size between lesions that had a favorable (SD, PR, and CR) versus unfavorable response (PD) (17.2 vs 57.6 mm, P = 0.0044). Lesions that responded favorably were also more likely to have received a higher biologically effective dose (79.0 vs 59.6 Gy, P = 0.027). Median PFS was 10.8 months, and 1 patient experienced grade 3 toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The SABR is a safe and effective local treatment modality in patients with oligometastatic gynecological disease. Distant progression remains the primary mode of failure in this patient population. In carefully selected patients, a combination of systemic treatment and SABR may offer long-term PFS.",exclusion,,,10.1097/IGC.0000000000000869,,,,

However, because brain metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma are relatively rare, the characteristics of this pathology are poorly understood. METHODS: We carried out a multicenter retrospective study to verify the characteristics of brain metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma in Japan. RESULTS: A total of 38 patients were enrolled and patient characteristics were poor general condition in many patients due to the progression of primary cancers. Stereotactic radiosurgery/stereotactic radiotherapy alone was the most common treatment (39.5%), with best supportive care provided for 10.5%. Median survival was 6 months, the neurological death rate was 28%, and the rate of brain hemorrhage was high (39.5%). Overall survival was analyzed for correlations with age, etiology of chronic liver disease, albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade, RPA classification, control of the primary tumor, number of brain metastases, brain hemorrhage, surgical resection, and radiotherapy. In multivariate analysis, ALBI grade, number of brain metastases and brain hemorrhage showed statistically significant correlation. CONCLUSIONS: A multivariate analysis extracted three items-ALBI grade, number of brain metastases, and brain hemorrhage-as prognostic factors for survival of brain metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma.",exclusion,,,10.1007/s10147-018-1312-5,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a retrospective review of all pediatric patients referred to our radiation oncology department over a 5-year span from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2011. RESULTS: Of 244 total pediatric patients referred, a subset of 45 (18.4%) were treated specifically with palliative intent for a total of 83 courses of RT. Follow-up data until study closure or death were available for 98% of patients. The median survival after initiation of palliative RT was 6.5 months. Overall, 23% of the children were alive at last follow-up visit, and 77% were deceased. The prescribed RT was completed in 93% of courses; 7% of courses were discontinued because of clinical deterioration due to systemic disease progression. The overall symptom response rate (partial or complete) was 72%. Overall response rate by symptom was 80% for bone pain, 55% for dyspnea or chest pain, 58% for neurologic symptoms, 50% for bleeding, and 100% for liver pain or ascites. Response rates by histology were 100% for leukemias, 91% for neuroblastoma, 76% for Ewing sarcoma, 64% for rhabdomyosarcoma, 54% for osteosarcoma, and 50% for primary central nervous system neoplasms. For responders, the median time from RT initiation to response was 1 week. For 7% of patients, a repeat course of RT for the same site and symptom was performed. No patients experienced RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) grade 3 or greater acute or late toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: RT is a useful palliative tool for pediatric patients that merits continued use and further study.",exclusion,Wrong patients,,10.1016/j.prro.2014.08.015,,,,

This report is a retrospective study of the clinicopathological features of NET patients with brain metastasis whose tissue diagnosis was made at our hospital. METHODS: Patients with brain metastasis evidenced by clinical records and images were accumulated among 302 patients in whom tissue diagnosis of NETs was made at our hospital between 2008 and 2013. In the patients, the primary lesion, pathological classification, pattern of metastasis, details of treatment, and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Brain metastasis was observed in 31 patients (10.3%). The primary lesion was in the lungs in 26 patients (83.9%), and the mammary glands, esophagus, and uterus in 1 patient each. Primary lesions were unknown in 2 patients, including 1 patient in whom NETs were detected in the lymph nodes alone. Pathological classification of the primary lesion was NET Grade 2 (Ki-67: 3 to 20%) in 3 patients and neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC, Ki-67: ≥ 21%) in 26 patients. The median period from onset of the primary lesion up to diagnosis of brain metastasis was 12.8 months, and the brain lesion preceded brain metastasis in 6 patients. Ten patients had a single metastasis whereas 21 patients had multiple metastases, but no characteristics were observed in their images. Brain metastasis was extirpated in 10 patients. Stereotactic radiotherapy alone was administered in 6 patients, and brain metastasis was favorably controlled in most of the patients with coadministration of cranial irradiation as appropriate. The median survival period from diagnosis of brain metastasis was 8.1 months, and the major cause of death was aggravation of the primary lesion or metastatic lesions in other organs. CONCLUSION: Most of NET patients with brain metastasis showed the primary lesion of NEC in the lungs, and they had multiple metastases to the liver, lymph nodes, bones, and so forth at the time of diagnosis of brain metastasis. The guidelines for accurate diagnosis and treatment of NETs should be immediately established based on further analyses of NET patients with brain metastasis.",exclusion,,,10.1186/s12885-015-1999-x,,,,

We also evaluate the prognostic factors of clinical outcome. Material(s) and Method(s): During the period of 2008 to 2015, 64 consecutive intermediate (n = 38) and locally advanced (n = 26) HCC patients that are unsuitable for surgical resection, were treated with single dose of TACE followed by SBRT 3-6 weeks later in our center; their outcomes were prospectively monitored. Those who had Child-Pugh (CP) score > B7, ECOG >=2, extra-hepatic metastasis or infiltrative tumors were excluded in this analysis. SBRT dose, range from 5-8Gy x 6 fractions or 4Gy x 5-10 fractions, were individualized according to normal tissue constraints. Resections were carried out in 12 patients (18.8%) after downsizing of tumor, otherwise no scheduled treatment delivered unless disease progression. Primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points were response rate and toxicity. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 17.9 months (range: 3-96 months). Patients' characteristics were as follows: CP class A/B (n = 60/4); HKLC stage IIb/IIIa/IIIB (n = 34/4/26); BCLC stage B/C (n = 39/25); solitary/oligonodular (2-3)/ multinodular (>3) (n = 35/20/9); tumor size 5-10 cm/ 10.1-15 cm/>15 cm (n = 30/19/15); vascular invasion (n = 18). The median overall survival (OS) was 23.2 months (95% Cl, 15.1-38.6 months). For intermediate (HKLC stage IIb and IIIa) and locally advanced (HKLC stage IIIb) tumor, the median OS was 23.7 months (95% Cl: 19.8-42.3 months) and 16.9 months (95% Cl: 7.6-26.1 months) respectively, the latter compares favorably to historical data of around 6 months. Conversion to resectable tumor after TACE + SBRT (HR = 10.3, 95% Cl 2.7-39.1) and size of lesion (HR = 4.25, 95% Cl 2.04- 8.84) were significant on multivariate analysis in predicting OS. The objective tumor response rate by RECIST criteria was 68.9%. All except one patient (98.4%) completed the planned treatment. Toxicity >= grade 3 was seen in 17.2% of patients, and treatment-related death occurred in two patients (3.1%). 11% of patients without disease progression had decline of CP class at 3 months. No patient developed classical radiationinduced liver disease (RILD). Conclusion(s): Combined TACE and SBRT is an effective and safe treatment in HKLC intermediate or locally advanced HCC that unsuitable for resection. Overall survival is remarkably better than historical data in locally advanced tumor (HKLC stage IIIb). Further prospective studies on this approach are warranted.",exclusion,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000443566,,,,

Nowadays, many therapies have been used for treating this group of HCC patients, including TACE. However, residual tumors after TACE are not uncommon. In conventional, re‐TACE is recommended for managing residual tumors. However, accumulated overall survival is still poor in consecutive TACEs, leading to a low rate of <20% in 5 years. In this regard, radiotherapy has been proved to be effective in managing HCC patients, especially a novel technique named SABR. When compared with conventional‐fractionated radiotherapy, SABR demonstrated better treatment responses with fewer side effects in managing primary or metastatic liver tumors. In the literature, phase I and II trials of TACE plus SABR showed excellent local control rates and promising 1‐ and 2‐year survival rates.

Till now, trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is still one of common modalities in managing unresectable intermediate-stage HCC. However, post-TACE residual viable HCC is not uncommon, resulting in unsatisfied overall survival after TACE alone. Recently, stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) has been suggested to manage HCC curatively. However, evidence from phase-III trials is largely lacking. Hence, the present phase III randomized trial is designed to compare clinical outcomes between SABR and re-TACE for unresectable HCC patients who had incomplete response after initial TACE. METHODS: The present study is an open-label, parallel, randomized controlled trial. A total of 120 patients will be included into two study groups, i.e., SABR and re-TACE, with a 1:1 allocation rate. A 3-year allocating period is planned. Patients with incomplete response after initial TACE will be enrolled and randomized. The primary endpoint is 1-year freedom-form-local-progression rate. Secondary endpoints are disease-progression-free survival, overall survival, local control, response rate, toxicity, and duration of response of the treated tumor. DISCUSSION: SABR has been reported as an effective modality in managing intermediate-stage HCC patients, but evidence from phase-III randomized trials is largely lacking. As a result, conducting randomized trials to demarcate the role of SABR in these patients is warranted, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, where HBV- and HCV-related HCCs are prevalent. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Before enrolling participants, the present study was registered prospectively on ClinicalTrials.gov (trial identifier, NCT02921139 ) on Sep. 29, 2016.

However, there is no consensus in which setting SBRT should be used in patients with HCC. Therefore, the aim of our propensity score matched analysis was to analyze the efficacy of SBRT in comparison to transarterial chemoembolization in intermediate and advanced HCC Methods: Patients treated with first TACE between 2003 and 2015 were retrospectively enrolled and analyzed. Further, HCC patients who were allocated to SBRT treatment bewteen 2013 and 2016 were prospectively analyzed by reviewing medical records, laboratory parameters and imaging studies. Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for differences in baseline and tumor characteistics of TACE and SBRT patients. The primary endpoint was the disease control rate (DCR) one year after treatment, overall survival (OS) and 1-year moratlity. Result(s): Patients treated with SBRT (n = 35) presented with advanced HCC and significantly impaired liver function compared to patients treated with TACE (n = 367) in the unmatched cohort. The DCR one year after treatment in the unmachted cohort was 74.4% for patients treated with TACE compared to 84.8% in the SBRT group. However, patients treated with TACE showed significantly improved OS compared to SBRT patients (17.0 months vs. 9.0 months, p = 0.016). After propensity score matching, the DCR in the TACE (n = 70) and SBRT (n = 35) group was comparable (82.9% vs. 84.8%, p = 0.805) and OS did not differ significantly in both groups (11.0 months vs. 9.0 months, p = 0.492).

We sought to compare outcomes for these 2 modalities. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 2000 to 2015, 161 patients with 282 pathologically diagnosed unresectable liver metastases were treated with RFA (n = 112) or SBRT (n = 170) at a single institution. The primary outcome was freedom from local progression (FFLP). The effect of treatment and covariates on FFLP was modeled using a mixed-effects Cox model with application of inverse probability treatment weighting to adjust for potential imbalances in treatment modality. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 24.6 months. Patients receiving SBRT had larger tumors than those treated with RFA (median, 2.7 cm vs 1.8 cm; P < .01). On univariate analysis, tumor size was associated with worse FFLP for RFA (hazard ratio [HR]; 1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-2.14; P < .01) but not for SBRT (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.76-2.51; P = .3). The 2-year FFLP rate was 88.2% compared with 73.9%, favoring SBRT (P = .06). For tumors ≥2 cm in diameter, SBRT was associated with improved FFLP (HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.09-0.93; P < .01). On multivariate analysis, treatment with SBRT (HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.07-0.62; P = .005) and smaller tumor size (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47-0.91; P = .01) were associated with improved FFLP. The 2-year overall survival rate was 51.1%, with no difference between groups (P = .8). Grade ≥3 treatment-related toxicity was rare, with no difference between SBRT (n = 4) and RFA (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with SBRT or RFA is well tolerated and provides excellent and similar local control for intrahepatic metastases <2 cm in size.

random-journal.pdf,LivP74,NCT02791503,2016,,LIV.M:#2;LIV.P:#1,CROSSFIRE Trial: comparing the Efficacy of Irreversible Electroporation With Radiotherapy,"Pancreatic cancer has the highest mortality rate of all major cancers; 94% of pancreatic cancer patients will die within five years of diagnosis, 74% within the first year of diagnosis; only 6% will survive for more than five years. Surgical resection is the only curative option. However, about 40% present with non‐metastatic locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma (LAPC; AJCC stage III). These patients are not eligible for surgical resection because the tumor involves major blood vessels such as the superior mesenteric artery, celiac axis, common hepatic artery and/or portal vein. These patients are currently treated with palliative chemotherapy as first line therapy. Focal therapy using external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) may further improve survival, but outcome remains poor. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is a form of EBRT that has important advantages over conventional radiotherapy such as a more precise and greater biological dose delivery and hence less toxicity and presumably better outcome. For patients diagnosed with LAPC, a combination of chemotherapy plus local tumor destruction using irreversible electroporation (IRE), a novel tumor ablation technique, has recently shown great promise. IRE is based on permeabilization of the cell membrane through electrical pulses leading to apoptosis. Theoretically, IRE only affects viable tumor tissue, leaving surrounding vital structures relatively intact. It is therefore considered to cause less morbidity than thermal ablative strategies. The CROSSFIRE‐trial is a prospective, randomized controlled phase‐II/III trial.The primary aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of chemotherapy and IRE (experimental arm) to the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiation (control arm) in patients with locally advanced, non‐resectable, non‐metastasized, pancreatic cancer. In total, 138 patients with histologically proven locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (AJCC stage III), aged ≥ 18 years will be included. Patients with a specific cardiac history (arrhythmias, pacemaker), pre‐existent ECG‐abnormalities and/or non‐retrievable metallic self‐expanding biliary stents are excluded from participation. Patients will be randomly allocated to receive either chemotherapy and radiation (control arm) or chemotherapy and IRE (experimental arm).",exclusion,,,,,,,

However, less than 5% of patients are ultimately candidates as a result of frequent comorbidities and graft shortage. The aim of this study was to evaluate stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) as an ablative treatment for inoperable HCC. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A prospective phase 2 trial included newly diagnosed single HCC lesions that were without extrahepatic extension and that were deemed unsuitable for standard locoregional therapies, with a tumor size ranging from 1 to 6 cm. The SBRT dose was 45 Gy in 3 fractions. Primary endpoint was the local control of irradiated HCC at 18 months, defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. RESULTS: Forty-three patients were treated and evaluable. Median follow-up was 4.0 years (range, 1.2-4.6 years). All 43 patients had cirrhosis; 37 (88%) were Child-Pugh grade A and 5 (12%) grade B (1 missing data). No patients had received prior local treatment. Thirteen patients (31%) presented grade ≥3 acute adverse events, including 8 patients with an abnormality of the liver function tests (19%). Three patients (10%) experienced a decline in Child-Pugh at 3 months post-SBRT. The 18-month local control rate was 98% (95% confidence interval, 85%-99%). The 18-month overall survival rate was 72% (range, 56%-83%). Median overall survival was 3.5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Local control and overall survival after SBRT for untreated solitary HCC were excellent despite candidates being unfit for transplantation, resection, ablation, or embolization treatments. SBRT should be considered as a bridge to transplant or as definitive therapy for those ineligible for transplant.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.12.004,,,,

The liver is the most frequent site of metastases and dominates the length of survival for this disease. As surgical and systemic therapies have become accepted and now are proven to be potentially curative, other sites of metastases have become more clinically relevant in terms of clinical symptoms and influence on survival.

In this review, we will first summarize key issues with metastatic colorectal cancer to the liver and available treatments.

Online plan adaptation increases treatment times for patients and comprises an increased burden on technical and clinical staff. Although preliminary trial results are encouraging, it remains unclear if the dosimetric benefits of online‐adaptive planning studies will translate to measurable improvements in clinical outcomes that merit its routine use. In our preliminary study, plan adaptation was most often required when tumors were adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract (the esophagus to the sigmoid colon), as those structures were most commonly the dose‐limiting structures and were noted to change in location on a day‐to‐day basis. For these reasons, abdominal disease sites have historically highlighted the limitations of SBRT. Specifically, the investigators will enroll patients with oligometastatic or unresectable primary disease of the non‐liver abdomen to a randomized, prospective trial. Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms, in which they will receive either online‐adaptive, MRI‐guided SBRT or non‐adaptive MRI‐guided SBRT. Both patient groups will undergo MRI simulation and MRI treatment localization with online MR monitoring and/or gating. All patients will be treated in five fractions over one to two weeks. By adhering to strict normal tissue constraints, the investigators expect toxicity to be within the current standard of care for the non‐adaptive arm, with reduction in toxicity in the arm of patients who undergo adaptation based on daily anatomic changes.",exclusion,,,,,,,

After this approach had been implemented in a PET/CT device and proved in preliminary studies and phantom measurements it was integrated in our planning process for free breathing SBRT since 2010. In 2015 we started free breathing SBRT via robotic arm linear accelerator using data - driven 4 D PET/MRI - based target delineation without fiducials for patients with primary or secondary liver tumors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of potential local failures of SBRT with special emphasis on relapses close to field edges. Materials/Methods: 100 patients (124 lesions) with a minimum of 10 months observing time post SBRT were analyzed. They suffered from primary (6 CCC, 1HCC) or secondary (93) liver tumors. Secondary liver tumors were caused by colorectal, breast, lung, stomach, pancreatic cancer, or malign melanoma. All patients underwent data-driven 4 D (F18) FDG PET/MRI and planning CT. SBRT was delivered by robotic arm linear accelerator with BED > 100 Gy mostly in 3 fractions, in cases of close proximity to stomach or duodenum in 5 fractions. Follow-up included MRI 6 and 12 weeks post SBRT, followed by MRI scans every 3/6 month. Tumor response was based on the response criteria for solid tumors. Follow - up scans were evaluated to recurrent cancer and matched to planned dose parameters. Result(s): All patients underwent planning and application procedure as intended. No toxicity >degree1 (CTCAE v_3.0) has been observed. Mean observing time post SBRT is 18.3 months on average (10 to 31). One in - field relapse has been observed, no relapse close to the field edges occurs. Conclusion(s): It is feared that SBRT planning using data - driven 4 D procedures may underestimate target movement, so relapses close to planned field edges can occur. The use of a data - driven 4 D PET approach, either on a PET/CT or PET/MRI device, did not show field-edge relapses, rendering a valid method for SBRT in free breathing without fiducials.Copyright © 2019",exclusion,No comparator,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.06.1968,,,,

The purpose of this study was to assess differences between RSI scores in primary colon cancer and metastases. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients were identified from our institutional review board-approved prospective observational protocol. A total of 704 metastatic and 1362 primary lesions were obtained from a de-identified metadata pool. RSI was calculated using the previously published rank-based algorithm. An independent cohort of 29 lung or liver colon metastases treated with 60 Gy in 5 fractions stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) was used for validation. RESULTS: The most common sites of metastases included liver (n=374; 53%), lung (n=116; 17%), and lymph nodes (n=40; 6%). Sixty percent of metastatic tumors, compared with 54% of primaries, were in the RSI radiation-resistant peak, suggesting metastatic tumors may be slightly more radiation resistant than primaries (P=.01). In contrast, when we analyzed metastases based on anatomical site, we uncovered large differences in RSI. The median RSIs for metastases in descending order of radiation resistance were ovary (0.48), abdomen (0.47), liver (0.43), brain (0.42), lung (0.32), and lymph nodes (0.31) (P<.0001). These findings were confirmed when the analysis was restricted to lesions from the same patient (n=139). In our independent cohort of treated lung and liver metastases, lung metastases had an improved local control rate compared to that in patients with liver metastases (2-year local control rate of 100% vs 73.0%, respectively; P=.026). CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of radiation sensitivity between primary and metastatic tissues of colon cancer histology revealed significant differences based on anatomical location of metastases.

METHODS: The (a) and (b) arms investigated primary and metastatic lung cancer differentiated by site of onset, arm (c) included primary or metastatic lesions outside the thorax, the (d) and (e) arms were for in-field reirradiation of recurrence, and finally, the (f) and (g) arms were for boost irradiation to the lesions after an adjuvant RT prescribed dose. A 4 months cut-off after previous irradiation course was fixed to distinguish the boost from the retreatment (<4 vs >4 months, respectively). Patients were prospectively enrolled in study arms according to tumor site, clinical stage and previous treatment. The total dose prescribed to the isocenter, ranged from 20 to 50 Gy according to the protocol design and the doses per fraction ranged from 4 to 10 Gy in 5 days. RESULTS: A total of 281 patients (M/F: 167/114; median age: 69 years) with 376 lesions underwent SBRT. No acute toxicity was reported in 175 patients (62.3%) while 106 (37.7%) experienced only low-grade (G < 2) acute toxicity. Four patients (all previously irradiated in the same site) showed >Grade 2 toxicity within 6 months from SBRT. With a median follow-up of 19 months, 204 patients (72.6%) did not experience late toxicity, and 77 (27.4%) experienced low grade late toxicity. On per-lesion basis, the 12-and 24 months actuarial local control inside the SBRT field were 84.3 and 73.7 %, respectively.

random-journal.pdf,LivP81,,2016,English,5 study;LIV.M:#5;LIV.P:#5,Dosimetric aspects and robustness in treatment plan optimisation of small tumours,"Stereotactic radiation of small brain targets provides high spatial resolution and accuracy for positioning of patient and radiation fields, almost on submillimeter ranges. This is not matched by equally sharp dose gradients, since finite source size, collimator design limitations and transport of electrons in the irradiated tissue all diffuses the dose. Not surprisingly, the dose prescriptions evolving for small brain tumors aimed for a specified dose to the target periphery, accepting whatever resulting dose to the target center. A kind of standard evolved aiming for a ratio of approximately 65% relative dose at the periphery versus the maximum target center dose (or 154% center-to-periphery ratio). This dose heterogeneity was considered favorable, as to more effectively treat presumably hypoxic cells at the tumor center. The stereotactic treatment methodology for brain treatments were in the early 1990s transferred to radiation of liver metastasis. Through use of stereotactic body frame high target positioning reproducibility was achieved, and similar dose prescriptions of heterogeneous dose were applied, with a center-to-periphery dose ratio of approximately 154%. Soon the technique was also applied to peripheral lung tumors. Following the development of 3D treatment planning systems in the late 1980s, ICRU responded to the need for consistent handling of geometrical uncertainties and launched in 1993 the ICRU 50 report recommending the use of GTV, CTV and PTV to capture the uncertainties. Specifically, the role of PTV was to ""ensure that the prescribed dose is actually absorbed in the CTV"". The normal use of the PTV is to plan a homogenous dose to its interior, through which it is assumed that the CTV gets the same dose as it is located in the PTV. This requires the dose inside the PTV to be both homogeneous and robust with respect to movements involving heterogeneities. The PTV concept was applied also for extracranial stereotactic body treatments, often inheriting a high center-to-periphery prescription. Dose calculations at the time used ""class a"" algorithms that not account for dose variations due to a varying level of lateral charged particle equilibrium caused by low density regions. Most so called pencil beam algorithms belong to this, class a, category. Accurate dose calculations can now be achieved with ""class b"" algorithms such as Monte Carlo, Collapsed Cone or Grid based Boltzmann equation solvers. However, for any algorithm that would calculate the dose physically correct, the resulting dose for the PTV is not representative for the CTV when the margin around the latter contains a lower density medium. Hence, the straight forward application of PTV based treated planning together with heterogeneous prescriptions principles (originally inherited from intracranial treatments), has created a confused situation with large uncertainties with respect to the actually delivered doses. A robust dosimetry can be achieved by realizing that the dose to a CTV surrounded by a low density medium will be independent of movements as long as it is exposed to a uniform fluence. Given that a near homogeneous fluence cover the PTV, dose prescriptions can then be done directly to the CTV based on a dose calculation with a ""class b"" algorithm (MC, CC or equivalent). As long as the movements of the CTV are kept well inside a PTV with a homogeneous fluence, the dose delivered to the CTV will be much closer to the prescribed dose, thus providing robust dose specification for small tumors. However, tools for optimization of uniform fluence are presently not provided in clinical TPS. Luckily, several workarounds exists that can ""cheat"" the optimization of homogenous dose to instead yield a effectively homogeneous fluence. From a pure physics point of view, this can be achieved by incapacitating the lateral spread of energy from the rays of the primary beam. In class a algorithms of the pencil beam kind, this can be implemented by changing the pencil beam parameter controlling the lateral spread. In point kernel algorithms such as CC, similar manipulation of kernel data can be done. In essence, in most algorithms fluence is a precursor for dose providing opportunities to access it. Alternatively, the density of the PTV can be set to a high value that shortens the electron transport distance enough to make the dose more fluence like. In summary, a robust small lung tumor dose can be implemented through a planning process in which the PTV is determined by the common practice addition of a setup margin to a MIP projections ITV, but replacing the common practice dose calculations by a fluence optimization followed by a class b dose calculation with the CC (or similar) algorithm, using absolute dose prescriptions to the CTV rather than the PTV. For a test series of 5 patients this procedure reduced the difference between prescribed and delivered dose to the CTV from 30% to 8% in D98, with a similar reduction for D02.",exclusion,,,,,,,

Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has emerged as a promising ablative therapy, although its comparison with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) remains confined to a single institution retrospective review. We sought to characterize the comparative outcomes and cost between the two treatment strategies. Method(s): We conducted a secondary analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database (2004-2011) and identified adult patients with stage I or II HCC and treated with RFA or SBRT as the initial treatment within 6 months of diagnosis. Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis. Factors associated with overall survival and 90-day hospital admission post-treatment were identified using propensity score (PS) adjusted multivariate analysis. We performed costs analysis and calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Result(s): Four hundred and forty patients were identified, 408 treated with RFA and 32 SBRT. In the overall cohort, 90-day hospitalization and 1-year mortality were similar between groups but RFA patients had better overall survival (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed advanced age, higher stage, decompensated cirrhosis, and treatment with SBRT (HR 1.80; 95%CI: 1.15-2.82) was associated with worse survival, but in the PS adjusted analysis, survival and costs were similar between the two groups. Conclusion(s): In a national cohort of early stage HCC patients, treatment with RFA vs SBRT resulted in no significant difference in survival, 90-day hospitalization, or costs.

Fortunately, with the development of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), treatment of lung cancer usher in a new era, resulting in a hit of precise therapy and molecule sequencing. However, it is inevitable for patients to gain acquired resistance of EGFR TKI. Several studies have been demonstrated that there were approximately 30% heterogeneous cells in primary tumors. And emerging studies illuminated that main pattern of treatment failure was the recurrence of primary site. Moreover, it was proved that despite of the drug‐resistance cells in progressive site, continual prescription of EGFR TKI in oligometastasis lung cancer could make a difference for patients in progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), owing to the residual responsive cells in another sites. Therefore, to explore an unique method to control heterogeneous cells in primary site so as to delay or prevent acquired resistance when taking EGFR TKI orally may be of great benefit and therapy. It is known to all that stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), with the advantage of hypofractionation and rapid release, succeed in several cancers, such as early lung cancer, prostatic, liver cancer and so on, for local control. Numerous reports explained SBRT played an irreplaceable role in progressive NSCLC patients after oral targeted medicine, regardless of EGFR or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutation. And the radiosensitivity of EGFR TKI in vitro and vivo may account for these inspiring results. What's more, it has reported that SBRT could induce inflammatory cell death, activate dendritic cell as well as accelerate antigen presentation in the draining lymph node, leading to antigen‐specific adaptive immune response. Nevertheless, although the potential effects of SBRT on advanced NSCLC are obviously, few studies explore the preventive benefits of early SBRT combined with oral EGFR TKI on advanced lung cancer by eliminating the heterogeneous cells in primary site. In addition, the investigators' previous phase II study of SBRT combined with oral EGFR TKI had revealed its safety and potentially improvement of PFS for 6 months. In this trial, the investigators put sight into assessing the efficacy of early application of SBRT to primary site in the advanced NSCLC patients and provide a hypothesis that early SBRT could strengthen the anti‐tumor effect of EGFR TKI through eradicating the heterogenity of initial tumor cells.",exclusion,,,,,,,

Until now, little evidence has been available for determining the efficacy of SBRT in comparison to RFA. We evaluated the efficacy of SBRT and RFA for hepatocellular carcinoma. Material and Methods Seven hundred and sixty-eight patients who were treated for hepatocellular carcinoma at our institution between 2012 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Among these, 663 patients who underwent RFA of 731 tumors and 105 patients who underwent SBRT of 114 tumors were included. The most frequently used dosefractionation schedule in SBRT was a total of 60 Gy in 4 fractions and a total of 52 Gy in 4 fractions. Radiological responses were assessed using the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST). To minimize the effects of potential confounders and selection bias, propensity score matching analysis (PSM) was performed. Finally, 95 tumors were selected from each treatment arm. Freedom from local progression (the primary endpoint, FFLP) was compared before and after adjustment with PSM. Results At baseline, SBRT-treated tumors were more advanced, larger (median, 2.4 vs. 1.6 cm), and more frequently located in the subphrenic region than RFA-treated tumors (50.0% vs. 31.1%, P < 0.001). The median follow-up was 21.5 (range, 0.7-64.2) months. Before PSM, the 1- and 2- year FFLP rates were 85.7% and 76.3% for the SBRT group and 82.6% and 70.4% for the RFA groups, respectively (P = 0.265). After PSM, the 1- and 2-year FFLP rates were 83.7% and 74.9% for the SBRT group and 76.1% and 64.9% for the RFA group, respectively (P = 0.243). The local control rates were not significantly different between the two groups before or after PSM. The Cox proportional hazards model revealed the treatment modality as an independent predictor of local recurrence favoring SBRT in the entire cohort (HR: 1.96, 95.0% CI: 1.21-3.17; P = 0.006) and in the PSM model (HR: 1.73, 95.0% CI: 0.98- 3.05; P = 0.060). Tumor location (subphrenic region) and tumor size (>2.0 cm) were independent predictors in the RFA group but not in the SBRT group. Overall toxicity rate did not differ between two groups. Conclusion Both SBRT and RFA can achieve excellent local control for localized HCC. SBRT appears to be an effective alternative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma when RFA is not feasible due to tumor location or size.",exclusion,Wrong comparator,,,,,,

It has been suggested that radiation (RT) and combination IO may work synergistically to increase the immune system's exposure to tumor antigens, potentiating an abscopal effect. However, the impact of combination IO to stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) on local control of irradiated lesions has not been elucidated. Materials/Methods: In this study, we combined two prospective phase II single arm studies to compare the impact of SBRT alone (NCT01239381) or with PD-L1/CTLA4 blockade (NCT03104439) on the growth of colorectal and pancreatic liver and lung metastases. Eligible patients had metastatic colorectal or pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Those treated on NCT01239381 received liver SBRT alone (30-50 Gy in 5 fractions), while those on NCT03104439 received combination IO 6 weeks prior to and concurrently with 24 Gy in 3 fractions to liver or lung metastases. Tumor genotyping was performed to assess for KRAS and TP53 mutations. Target lesions were measured on CT scans prior to and following RT. Peak response was measured via modified RECIST criteria as the largest tumor reduction at any time. Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were performed to evaluate % tumor reduction with regards to combination IO, primary tumor site, metastasis site, and KRAS and TP53 mutation status. Result(s): There were 50 eligible patients from NCT01239381 and 41 from NCT03104439, of whom 42 and 39 were evaluable, respectively. Of these 81 patients, 52 and 29 had colorectal and pancreatic cancer, respectively. Of those with molecular analysis, 50% (33/66) had a KRAS mutation and 55% (34/61) had a TP53 mutation. Median follow up was 78 days in the IO arm (driven by distant progression) and 160 days in the non-IO arm (P<0.0001). Mean BED in the IO arm was 43.2 Gy vs. 79.6 Gy in the SBRT alone arm (P<0.0001). Mean target size was 3.8 cm in the IO arm, and 5.0 cm in the SBRT alone arm (P=0.12). There was no difference with respect to overall response rate (38.5% vs. 52.4%, P=0.27) and disease control rate (92.3% vs. 92.9%, P>0.99). There was no significant difference in the % tumor reduction between the IO and non-IO arms (-21% vs. -41%, P=0.08). Among the entire cohort, there was no significant difference in response of irradiated lesion with respect to primary tumor type (P= 0.54), KRAS status (P=.67), TP53 status (P=0.10), or metastatic site (P=0.58). Conclusion(s): Despite receiving approximately half the BED dose compared to liver SBRT alone, patients treated with IO and RT had similar response rates, suggesting a potential synergistic effect in the irradiated lesions. Future studies should look to validate these findings and explore optimal RT dose/fractionation schemas in combination with IO. These results support ongoing randomized studies of IO with RT in locally advanced rectal (NRG GI002) and pancreatic (NCT03563248) cancers.Copyright © 2019",exclusion,Immunotherapy,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.06.608,,,,

However, frequently occurring large HCC tumors are still a dosimetric challenge in spite of modern high sophisticated RT modalities. This interventional clinical study has been set up to evaluate the value of different fiducial markers, and to use the modern imaging methods for further treatment optimization using physical and informatics approaches. METHODS AND DESIGN: Surgically implanted radioopaque or electromagnetic markers are used to detect tumor local-ization during radiotherapy. The required markers for targeting and observation during RT can be implanted in a previously defined optimal position during the oncologically indicated operation. If there is no indication for a surgical resection or open biopsy, markers may be inserted into the liver or tumor tissue by using ultrasound-guidance. Primary study aim is the detection of the patients' anatomy at the time of RT by observation of the marker position during the indicated irradiation (IGRT). Secondary study aims comprise detection and recording of 3D liver and tumor motion during RT. Furthermore, the study will help to develop technical strategies and mechanisms based on the recorded information on organ motion to avoid inaccurate dose application resulting from fast organ motion and deformation. DISCUSSION: This is an open monocentric non-randomized, prospective study for the evaluation of organ motion using interstitial markers or implantable radiotransmitter. The trial will evaluate the full potential of different fiducial markers to further optimize treatment of moving targets, with a special focus on liver lesions.",exclusion,,,10.1186/s13014-015-0456-y,,,,
random-journal.pdf,LivP88,,2015,English,5 study;LIV.M:#5;LIV.P:#1,Evolving role of radiation for oligometastases,"The key objectives of this presentation are to review the fundamental biology underlying metastatic disease, understand the definition and clinical evidence for oligo- (or limited) metastatic disease, analyze key clinical trials showing the potential role of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for oligometastases and address challenges regarding this ""high-tech"" strategy. In the early 1900s, Halsted suggested that breast cancer spread via the local regional lymphatic vessels in a stepwise manner. Thus, once there are metastases, local therapy had no clear role. Later in the 20th century, an opposing theory (the ""Fisher"" theory) suggested that cancer is a systemic disease that, if it will ever metastasize, will already have done so early in the disease course. Local therapies are therefore less important than systemic therapies. A counterpoint to these approaches was proposed by Hellman and Weichselbaum, postulating that cancer is a spectrum from localized to wide-spread disease at the time of diagnosis, with many intermediate states (Hellman S, Weichselbaum RR. Oligometastases. J Clin Oncol. 1995 Jan;13(1):8-10). ""Oligometastases"" are essentially early metastases which are limited in number and location and based on a state of limited metastatic capacity. The hypothesis based on this approach is that there may be a subset of patients with oligometastatic disease for whom aggressive local treatment (such as surgery or SBRT) could change their outcome. Clinical evidence for oligometastasis includes the surgical experience for lung or liver metastases showing long-term survivals of approximately 20%. Studies are now emerging suggesting similar results utilizing SBRT. In an individual patient data metaanalysis of outcomes after surgery or SBRT, Ashworth et al. reported a 5-year survival rate of approximately 30% in patients with oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer (Ashworth AB, et al. An individual patient data metaanalysis of outcomes and prognostic factors after treatment of oligometastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. Clin Lung Cancer. 2014 Sep;15(5):346-55). They developed a risk classification schema showing a better prognosis for metachronous vs. synchronous oligometastases (of which node-negative was favorable to node-positive). Other studies have shown that, among patients treated with SBRT for 1-5 oligometastases, those with <=3 metastases had better outcomes compared to those with 4-5 metastases. The size of the metastases also appears to be important, as well as the biological equivalent dose (BED) of the SBRT. Studies have begun to explore the role of SBRT for oligometastases involving the lung, liver, adrenal, and other sites. It is likely that host-related factors (for example, immune mediated anticancer activity) and tumor related factors (such as genomics and proteomics) also affect the spectrum of disease aggressiveness. Challenges to this new ""high-tech"" approach will also be addressed, including issues related to patient selection, the level of evidence, and the cost effectiveness of this approach. Other approaches for improving the outcome for patients with metastatic disease will also be discussed, including the role of early palliative interventions. In summary, emerging (albeit non-randomized) data suggests that SBRT appears to be a promising strategy in selected patients with oligometastases. The patients most likely to benefit from SBRT have metachronous (vs. synchronous) metastases, N0 (vs. N+) disease, 1-3 metastases (vs. more), small metastases, and the ability to receive a higher radiation dose (BED >100Gy). Randomized trials are needed to establish whether SBRT improves progression free and/or over survival in this setting.",exclusion,Narrative review,"Important, read for more information",,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with large HCCs (median diameter 7 cm, IQR 5-10 cm) with a Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score A (60%) or B (40%) and Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification stage B or C were treated with 3 to 12 fractions to allow personalized treatment according to the size of the lesions and the proximity of the lesions to the organs at risk aiming to give high biologically equivalent doses assuming an α/β ratio of 10 Gy for HCC. Primary end points were in-field local control and toxicity assessment. RESULTS: Forty seven patients with 64 lesions were treated with SBRT (median 45 Gy in 3-12 fractions) with a median follow up for patients alive of 19 months. The median biological effective dose was 76 Gy (IQR 62-86 Gy). Tumor vascular thrombosis was present in 28% and an underlying liver disease in 87% (hepatitis B or C in 21%, alcohol related in 51%, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in 13% of the patients, primary biliary cirrhosis 2%). Eighty three percent received prior and in most cases multiple therapies. Local control at 1 year was 77%. The median overall survival from the start of SBRT was 9 months (95% CI 7.7-10.3). Gastrointestinal toxicities grade ≥ 2 were observed in 3 (6.4%) patients. An increase in CTP score without disease progression was observed in 5 patients, of whom one patient developed a radiation induced liver disease. One patient died due to liver failure 4 months after treatment.

However, extreme caution should be exercised in treating tumors closely located to organs at risk (OARs) with SABR. To reduce complications, we have applied split-course SABR to oligometastases closely located to OARs or to those being retreated with radiotherapy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with oligometastases who were treated with planned split-course SABR between January 2012 and December 2016. RESULTS: A total of 23 patients with 29 oligometastatic lesions were enrolled. The primary diagnoses were bone and soft tissue cancers in 13 lesions, liver cancers in 12 lesions, and colorectal cancers in four lesions. The median tumor volume was 78 cm3 (range, 4-1781 cm3). The lesions were treated with 1-3 fractions in the first stage of SABR (first SABR), and one or two fractions in the second stage of SABR (second SABR). The time interval between the two stages was about 4 weeks. A partial response was noted in 16 lesions (55%) after the first SABR, and practical reductions in the doses to OARs were observed in the second SABR compared with the first SABR. The 1-, 2- and 3-year local control rates were 92%, 65% and 43%, respectively. No Grade 4 or 5 toxicities were observed during or after treatment.

NBTXR efficacy was demonstrated in a phase II/III study in soft tissue sarcoma (NCT075) and is currently evaluated in other solid tumors including liver cancers. The use of this radio enhancer is particularly relevant in liver cancer management, a difficult to treat heterogenous population, due to the presence of underlying liver dysfunction. Method(s): Phase I/II study of NBTXR activated by RT in patients (pts) with HCC (with/without portal vein tumor thrombus) or liver metastasis (mets) NCT071056. The dose escalation part followed a design with tested dose levels equivalent to 10, 15, and of baseline tumor volume. Patients were treated with a single intralesional inection (ILI) of NBTXR followed by Stereotaxic Body RT (SBRT 5 y/ fractions/5 to 7 days). Determination of recommended dose(s) and early dose limiting toxicities (DLT) were primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints include assessment of global safety profile, liver function evaluated by Child-Pugh score (CPS), AST to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), and response rate (mRECIST/RECIST 1.1). Result(s): The levels of ILI dose escalation were finalized (n 17) 6 pts at 10 ( SBRT doses tested due to organs constraints), pts at 15 and (due to fiducial displacement and ILI shift) and pts at were included. ILIs were successful and SBRT was delivered as planned with no observed DLT or NBTXR-related SAE at all levels. nly one grade 1 AE (fatigue) related to NBTXR was reported at dose level . No relevant change of CPS or APRI was observed over time. Among 7 evaluable HCC pts the best target lesion responses by mRECIST were CR and PR and among 5 evaluable mets pts PR, 1 SD and PD. Conclusion(s):This study demonstrated the feasibility and good tolerance of the first in class NBTXR ILI.

We investigated the preliminary outcome of efficacy and toxicity associated with frameless fractionated gamma knife radiosurgery (FF GKRS) for the treatment of large metastatic brain tumors. METHODS: Fifteen patients with 17 lesions were treated using FF GKRS and included in this study, because of the large tumor size of more than 10 cm(3). FF GKRS was performed based on a thermoplastic mask system for 3 to 5 consecutive days. RESULTS: The mean duration of clinical follow-up was 12 months (range, 4-24), and the local control rate was 100%. Tumor volume decreased in 13 lesions (76.5%), and remained stable in 4 lesions (23.5%). One patient was classified as new lesion development because of the occurrence of leptomeningeal seeding regardless of the tumor volume change. Compared with the initial volume at the time of FF GKRS, tumor volume change at the last follow-up was 62.32% ± 29.80%. Cumulative survival rate at 12 months was 93.3% ± 6.4%. One patient died during the follow-up period because of the progression of the primary disease. No patient showed radiation necrosis on the follow-up images. CONCLUSION: Daily FF GKRS by gamma knife ICON™ revealed satisfactory tumor control rate and low morbidity, despite the short follow-up period.

We hypothesize that [(99m)Tc]-sulfur colloid (SC) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) scans can provide global functional liver metrics and functional liver dosimetric parameters that are predictive of hepatotoxicity risk in patients with primary liver cancer with cirrhosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 47 patients (n = 26 proton, n = 21 stereotactic body radiation therapy) with Child-Pugh (CP)-A (62%) or CP-B (38%) cirrhosis who underwent SC SPECT/CT scans for radiation therapy planning. SC SPECT scans were mined for image intensity threshold-based functional liver volumes (FLV), mean liver-spleen uptake ratio (L/S(mean)), and total liver function (TLF = FLV*L/S(mean)). Radiation therapy doses were voxel-wise converted to the biologically equivalent dose (EQD2(a/b=3)) and relative biological effectiveness (GyRBE). Normal liver (liver minus gross tumor volume [GTV]) and FLV mean doses, absolute and relative dose-volumes (V(Gy)[cc], V(Gy)[%]), and relative dose-function histogram quantiles in 10 GyEQD2 increments were calculated. Logistic regression was performed for correlation to CP score increase of 2 or higher (CP+2). Cox regression was performed for correlation to RILD-specific survival (RILD-SS) and overall survival. RESULTS: The strongest predictors of RILD-SS were FLV V20 and liver-GTV F20. FLV mean dose, but not CT-derived anatomic mean dose, was predictive of RILD-SS. TLF and L/S(mean) were the only parameters that were associated with CP+2 after adjusting for baseline CP score. Optimal cutoffs to mitigate risk RILD-SS were identified: FLV mean dose <23 GyEQD2, liver-GTV V20 <36%, FLV V20 <36%, liver-GTV F20 <36%, FLV <32% (350 cc), L/S(mean) >0.75, TLF >0.60, tumor volume <40 cm(3), and CP score A5-6 versus B7-C10. A narrower therapeutic window was observed in CP-B/C patients. The discriminatory power for RILD-SS within CP-B/C classes was improved with the addition of a functional dosimetric constraint, resulting in low- and high-risk subgroups (P = 3 × 10(-6)). CONCLUSIONS: Functional liver metrics and dosimetric parameters derived from pretreatment SC SPECT/CT scans were complementary predictors of hepatotoxicity and may provide useful clinical decision support in the management of cirrhotic patients with primary liver cancer.",exclusion,Other study,,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2018.08.029,,,,

We report on gallbladder toxicity and attribution to treatment in a prospective series of patients with primary and metastatic liver tumors receiving ablative-intent HFXRT and SBRT with protons. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We evaluated 93 patients with intact gallbladders enrolled in either of 2 trials investigating proton HFXRT and SBRT for primary and metastatic liver tumors from 2009 to 2014. Patients received 45 to 67.5 GyE in 15 fractions for primary liver tumors (n = 45) and 30 to 50 GyE in 5 fractions for metastatic tumors (n = 48). No gallbladder dose constraints were used at treatment, and gallbladder volumes and dose-volume histograms were created retrospectively. Attributable toxicity was defined as cholecystitis or perforation without preexisting gallbladder disease. Baseline factors were evaluated using Fisher exact test and the nonparametric K-sample test. RESULTS: At baseline, 25 patients had preexisting cholelithiasis and 15 underwent biliary stenting before or after RT. Median follow-up after treatment was 11.8 months (range, 0.1-59.2 months). Despite maximum gallbladder doses >70 GyE in 41%, >80 GyE in 31%, and >90 GyE in 13% (equieffective dose at 2 Gy [EQD2], α/β = 3), there were no attributable cases of gallbladder toxicity. Two patients developed grade 3 and 4 cholecystitis 16 and 2 months after treatment, respectively, and both had a strong history of preexisting cholelithiasis and biliary stenting. These patients received relatively low gallbladder doses with mean doses of 0.02 GyE and 5.1 GyE (EQD2, α/β = 3), well below the 17.1 GyE mean for the remaining cohort (range, 0-81.1 GyE, EQD2). CONCLUSIONS: We identified no relationship between gallbladder dose and toxicity and did not reach the maximum tolerated gallbladder dose in this cohort treated with high-dose radiation.

The study presents the geometric and dosimetric improvements in treatment accuracy of the gating compared to standard CBCT-guided non-gated treatment. Material and Methods Thirteen patients with primary liver cancer or metastases had three electromagnetic transponders (Calypso) implanted near the target and received three-fraction gated liver SBRT at a TrueBeam Linac. The PTV was created by a 5mm axial and 7mm (n=10) or 10mm (n=3) cranio-caudal (CC) expansion of the CTV as defined on an exhale breath-hold CT. A mean homogenous dose between 45 and 61.8Gy was prescribed to the CTV using 7-field IMRT or 3D conformal planning. The PTV was covered with 67% of the prescribed dose. Treatment was delivered in free-breathing but gated to the exhale breathing phase according to the continuously monitored (25Hz) transponder centroid position. Gate ON windows were set to +/- 3mm LR/AP and +/-4 mm CC around the exhale position of the transponders. The couch was adjusted remotely if baseline drifts above ~1mm of the exhale transponder position occurred. Post-treatment, log files of the transponder motion and treatment delivery were used to calculate the motion-induced geometrical errors during beam-on in the actual gated treatments and in simulated non-gated standard treatments with CBCT-guided setup to the mean transponder centroid position before each fraction. The observed motion was used to reconstruct the actually delivered CTV dose distribution with gating and the would-be dose distribution without gating. Results Fig. 1 shows the internal tumor motion during a single fraction. Due to drift and respiratory motion the mean (+/- SD) geometric error during non-gated treatment at this fraction (Fig1A) would have been 1.3mm (1.7) LR, 5.0mm (7.7) CC, and -2.0mm (1.8) AP. The gated treatment, including 5 couch shifts to counteract drift (Fig1B), reduced the errors to 0.7mm (0.7) LR, 0.4mm (1.9) CC, and -0.1mm (0.9) AP. Fig. 1C shows the CC geometrical errors for all patients. The mean (range) number of couch corrections for drifts during each gated fraction was 2.8 (0-7). The mean duty cycle during gated treatment was 60.8% (31.7-72.7%). As shown in Fig 2A, gating markedly reduced the population based PTV margin needed for intrafraction motion. Motion-including dosereconstruction provided the CTV-DVHs of all fractions of planned, actual gated delivered, and simulated non-gated delivered doses. Mean CTV-DVHs are shown in Fig 2B. Note the large DVH variation for non-gated treatments. The mean (range) reduction in CTV D95 relative to the planned dose was 0.9 percent points (0.1-2.3) with gating and 6.8 percent points (0.9-29.6) without gating. Conclusion Gating based on internal motion monitoring markedly reduced geometric and dosimetric errors in liver SBRT compared to non-gated standard treatment.

Indeed, most pts do not respond to initial therapy due to intrinsic resistance to checkpoint inhibition. There is thus an important unmet medical need for a curative treatment in these pts and converting the local immune microenvironment to a ""hot"" phenotype may help to overcome therapeutic resistance. Hafnium oxide nanoparticles (NBTXR3) activated by radiotherapy (RT) increase radiation dose deposit within cancer cells compared to RT alone. Recently, a phase II/III randomized trial of NBTXR3 in locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS) met primary and main secondary endpoints with significant superiority compared to RT alone. Furthermore NBTXR3+RT demonstrated an immunogenic cell deathmediated abscopal effect in a preclinical setting, and immune cell infiltration was observed in some tumors from STS pts treated with NBTXR3+RT but not in tumors from pts treated with RT alone. NBTXR3 is currently being evaluated in 7 clinical trials, including a phase I/II study in elderly frail patients with locally advanced HNSCC. To date, no early dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) have been observed.

Reduction of healthy tissue irradiation while at the same time increasing energy dose deposit within tumor cells still constitutes a challenge in radiation oncology. NBTXR3, hafnium oxide nanoparticles, increase energy deposit inside tumor cells only when activated by ionizing radiation such as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and thus increase tumor cell death compared to radiation alone. Patients (pts) with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or liver metastasis (mets) may benefit from the physical mode of action of NBTXR3, which does not engage liver and renal functions. A phase I/II clinical trial was conducted to evaluate NBTXR3 activated by SBRT in these pts [NCT02721056]. Materials/Methods: The Phase I part follows a 3+3 dose escalation design with dose levels of NBTXR3 corresponding to 10, 15, 22, and 33% of the baseline tumor volume. Pts were treated with a single NBTXR3 intralesional injection (ILI) followed by SBRT (45 Gy / 3 fractions / 5 to 7 days). Primary endpoints included identification of the recommended phase II dose(s) and early DLTs. Secondary endpoints included assessment of global safety profile, liver function evaluated by Child-Pugh score (CPS), AST to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), and response rate (mRECIST/RECIST 1.1). Result(s): Four levels of the dose escalation part are finalized (n=17): 6 pts at 10% (2 SBRT doses tested due to organs constraints), 4 pts at 15 and 22% (due to fiducial displacement and ILI shift) and 3 pts at 33%. No NBTXR3 related early DLT or SAE were observed. Indeed only one NBTXR3 related AE (G1 fatigue at 33%) was reported. There were no significant changes in CPS or APRI post-treatment. CT-scan assessment demonstrated absence of NBTXR3 leakage in surrounding tissues. Among 7 evaluable HCC pts, best mRECIST target lesion responses were: 3 CR, 4 PR. Among 5 evaluable mets pts, best target lesion responses were: 2 PR, 1 SD, 2 PD. Conclusion(s): NBTXR3 was well tolerated up to the 33% dose level and demonstrated a very good safety profile. The very good tolerance and preliminary anti-tumor effects have supported a protocol amendment to study an additional higher NBTXR3 dose level (42%). Indeed recent data reinforces this further escalation as OS and local control seem to depend on RT dose and tumor volume. Liver dysfunction is the limiting factor for treatment in these pts, hence, this innovative physics based approach may constitute a valuable solution for pts with unresectable liver tumors.

In patients unsuitable for surgery, interventional radiation oncology approaches, i.e.minimally invasive image-guided therapeutic procedures, offer newtreatment opportunities and can achieve good local control.NBTXR3, hafniumoxide nanoparticles, administered via intratumoral injection, increases energy deposit inside tumor cells only when activated by ionizing radiation such as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and thus increase tumor cell death compared to radiation alone. Indeed, NBTXR3 showed statistically superior efficacy over RT alone in a phase II/III trial in soft tissue sarcoma [NCT02379845] and is currently being evaluated in phase I/II trials: head and neck [NCT01946867; NCT02901483], prostate [NCT02805894] and rectal cancers [NCT02465593]. The innovative physicalmode of action ofNBTXR3, which does not engage liver and renal functions might thus be beneficial to patients (pts) with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or livermetastasis (mets). Method(s): A phase I/II clinical trial is being conducted to evaluate NBTXR3 activated by SBRT in patients with unresectable HCC or liver mets [NCT02721056].

Primary endpoints include determination of the recommended phase II dose(s) and early DLTs. Secondary endpoints include assessment of global safety profile, liver function evaluated by Child-Pugh score (CPS), AST to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), and response rate (mRECIST/RECIST 1.1).

ILIs were successful and SBRT was delivered as planned with no observed DLT at any dose level. One NBTXR3-related AE (G1 fatigue at 33%), 4 ILI-related AE (G2 malaise, 10%; two G3 abdominal pain, 15% and G1 bilateral pleural effusion, 22%) and one bile duct stenosis (G3) related to cancer disease and possibly to RT coupled with NBTXR3 administration were reported. There were no significant changes in CPS or APRI post-treatment. CT scan assessment demonstrated absence of NBTXR3 leakage in surrounding tissues. So far, among 7 evaluable HCC pts, best mRECIST target lesion responses were: 3 CR and 4 PR. Among 5 evaluable liver mets pts, best target lesion responses were: 2 PR, 1 SD, and 2 PD. Conclusion(s): NBTXR3 was well tolerated up to the 33% dose level and demonstrated a very good safety profile. The recruitment is ongoing at 42%.

BACKGROUND: Although the number of stereotactic body radiotherapies being performed for hepatocellular carcinoma has gradually increased, data comparing surgical resection and stereotactic body radiotherapy are limited. METHODS: Between 2008 and 2015, a total of 281 patients with 1 to 3 small hepatocellular carcinoma tumors (≤3 cm in diameter), treated initially with curative intent (surgical resection, 254; stereotactic body radiotherapy, 27), were retrospectively analyzed. Overall survival and disease-free survival were compared in a propensity score matching analysis. RESULTS: Patients in the surgical resection group tended to be younger, had more tumors, and had better hepatic function than those in the stereotactic body radiotherapy group (P < .05). The percent recurrence of the same sub-segment in the stereotactic body radiotherapy group was significantly higher than that in the surgical resection group (P = .0034). Propensity score analysis revealed that 54 patients with surgical resection and 27 with stereotactic body radiotherapy had the same baseline characteristics. The 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates for the surgical resection and stereotactic body radiotherapy groups were 75.2% vs 47.8% (P = .0149) and 33.8% vs 16.4% (P = .0512), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that surgical resection was a significant favorable factor for overall survival and disease-free survival of patients with one to three small hepatocellular carcinomas. CONCLUSION: Surgical resection provided better long-term overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma tumors. However, stereotactic body radiotherapy may be an effective alternative treatment for inoperable patients with early hepatocellular carcinoma.",inclusion,,Retrospectly?,10.1016/j.surg.2018.10.022,,,,

In a prior study from the University of Michigan, high circulating HGF levels after liver SBRT were correlated with increased risk of worsening of liver function. The purpose of this study is to explore the association of plasma HGF with outcomes of patients treated with H-PBT for HCC and ICC. Purpose/Objective(s): Using ELISA, we measured plasma HGF at baseline and weekly during H-PBT in pts with localized HCC or ICC enrolled in a phase II study (NCT00976898) at MGH. Pts received 15 fraction PBT to a dose of 67.5 Gy, with dose de-escalation based on mean liver dose. HGF levels at day 1, 8 and 15 were analyzed for correlations with overall survival (OS) and worsening of liver function defined as an increase in Childs-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score of 2 or greater at any time point. Result(s): Forty-one pts were evaluated: 20 pts had HCC, 20 pts had ICC, 1 patient had both (analyzed as ICC). Thirteen (32%) pts were female. Twelve (60%) HCC pts and 4 (19%) ICC pts had history of hepatitis C. Fifteen (75%) HCC pts and 17 (81%) ICC pts were CTP A, and the remainder of patients had CTP B at baseline, except 2 HCC and 1 ICC pts with no cirrhosis. Median tumor size was 6.3 cm (HCC 6.7 cm, ICC 5.4 cm). Median dose was 58.0 Gy for both HCC and ICC pts. The median of mean liver-GTV dose was 19.8 Gy for HCC pts and 15.8 Gy for ICC pts. 2 yr OS and PFS were 49% and 30% for HCC pts and 32% and 17% for ICC pts. A CTP increase >=2 points occurred in 10/41 patients. No increase in CTP occurred in pts with an HGF level below the median (P = 0.001). The median baseline level of HGF was 2,284 pg/mL, when stratified by the median HGF, pts with HGF above the median had a 2 yr OS of 29%, vs. 86% if HGF was below the median (log rank P = 0.001). Conclusion(s): The outcomes of H-PBT in both HCC and ICC were associated with baseline HGF. High HGF was associated with worsening liver function and worse OS.

Outcome and toxicity were evaluated retrospectively in this single-institution patient cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2010 and 2014, 39 lesions were irradiated in 33 consecutive patients (18 male, 15 female, median age of 68 years). All the lesions were liver metastases (n = 34) or primary hepatocellular carcinomas (n = 5). The patients had undergone four-dimensional respiration-correlated PET-CT for treatment simulation to capture tumor motion. We analyzed local control with a focus on CT-based response at three months, one year and two years after treatment, looking at overall survival and the progression pattern. RESULTS: All patients were treated with hypofractionated image-guided stereotactic radiotherapy. The equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions varied from 62.5 Gy to 150 Gy, delivered in 3-10 fractions (median dose 93.8 Gy, alpha/beta = 10). The CT-based regression pattern three months after radiotherapy revealed partial regression in 72.7% of patients with a complete remission in 27.3% of the cases. The site of first progression was predominantly distant. One- and two-year overall survival rates were 85.4% and 68.8%, respectively. No toxicity of grade 2 or higher according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 was observed. CONCLUSION: SABR is a safe and efficient treatment for selected inoperable patients or irresectable tumors of the liver. Future studies should combine SABR with systemic treatment acting in synergy with radiation, such as immunological interventions or hypoxic cell radiosensitizers to prevent distant relapse.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.1016/j.ejso.2014.10.053,,,,

Method(s): Between April and September 2015, six patients with primary (three patients) or secondary liver cancers (three patients) were treated with SBRT (3x15 Gy: 4 pts, 5x8 Gy: 1 pt or 6x5 Gy 1 pt). All patients received an HBS to assess hepatic perfusion before and three months after RT . The HBS was co-registered with the planning phase of the simulation CT-scanner. For each patient, the biological equivalent dose of 2 Gy per fraction (EQD2) was calculated with an alpha/ beta = 10 Gy, to assess the acute toxicity. Isodoses (5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 Gy) were drawn. Then, we calculated the activity (MBq) in these volumes before and after treatment. Result(s): Linear regression analysis showed a significant reduction in liver function at three months. This decrease was proportional to the increase of the radiation dose (p = 0.0009, Fig. 1), with a reduction of 0.78 % of the hepatic perfusion for each delivered gray. The linear equation that we found had a predictive value in predicting the loss of liver function depending on the delivered dose of 96 % (R2 = 0.9605). Conclusion(s): We showed for the first time the utility of HBS in evaluating the variation of liver function after SBRT . This analysis shows a functional decrease, which is proportional to the delivered dose, thus predicting the resulting acute toxicity.

We designed an individualized adaptive trial testing the hypothesis that adapting treatment based on change in liver function could optimize the therapeutic index for each patient. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the safety and efficacy of individualized adaptive stereotactic body radiotherapy (SRBT) for liver tumors in patients who have preexisting liver dysfunction. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From 2010 to 2014, 90 patients with intrahepatic cancer treated with prior liver-directed therapy were enrolled in this large phase 2, single-arm, clinical trial at an academic medical center. All patients had at least 1 year of potential follow-up. INTERVENTIONS: Using indocyanine green retention at 15 minutes (ICGR15) as a direct biomarker of liver function and a Bayesian adaptive model, planned SBRT was individually modified midway through the course of therapy to maintain liver function after the complete course. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was local control; the secondary outcome was safety and overall survival. RESULTS: Patients were 34 to 85 years of age, and 70% (63) were male. Ninety patients (69 [77%] with hepatocellular carcinoma, 4 [4%] with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and 17 [19%] with metastatic) received treatment to 116 tumors. Sixty-two patients (69%) had cirrhosis, 21 (23%) were Child-Pugh (CP) grade B. The median tumor size was 3 cm; 16 patients (18%) had portal vein involvement. Sixty-two (69%) received all 5 fractions (47 full dose, 15 dose-reduced owing to rising ICGR15). Treatment was well tolerated, with a lower than expected complication rate without adaptation: 6 (7%) experienced a 2-point decline in CP 6 months post-SBRT. The 1- and 2-year local control rates were 99% (95% CI, 97%-100%) and 95% (95% CI, 91%-99%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We demonstrated that the treatment strategy of individualized adaptive therapy based on a direct biomarker of liver function can be used to achieve both high rates of local control and a high degree of safety without sacrificing either. Individualized adaptive radiotherapy may represent a new treatment paradigm in which dose is based on individual, rather than population-based, tolerance to treatment.

It has been hypothesized that SBRT may translate to a better quality of life by delaying the need for systemic chemotherapy and possibly increasing survival. There is limited published literature on the efficacy of SBRT in limited nodal metastases. The primary aim is to review institutional outcomes of patients with solitary or oligometastatic lymph nodes treated with SBRT. METHODS: A retrospective study of patients treated with SBRT to metastatic lymph nodes (March 2010-June 2015) was conducted. Endpoints of this study were local control (LC), chemotherapy-free survival (CFS) following SBRT, toxicities, progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Eighteen patients with a mean age of 65 years underwent SBRT to metastatic lymph nodes. Median follow-up was 33.6 months. There were four hepatocellular carcinoma, seven colorectal, four pancreatic, one esophageal, one gallbladder and one lung primary. Eleven (61%) patients had lymph node metastases at initial presentation of metastatic disease. Seven patients (39%) had systemic therapy prior to SBRT, with five patients receiving two lines of chemotherapy. Eight patients had solitary metastatic disease at the time of radiotherapy. All patients had <5 metastases. Median size of lymph node metastases was 1.95 cm (range: 0.8-6.2 cm). RT doses were 31 to 60 Gy in four to ten fractions, with 44% of patients receiving 35 Gy in 5 fractions. At 1 year, LC was 94% and CFS from SBRT was 60%. One-year PFS and OS were 39% and 89% respectively. There were no grade 3 or higher toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: In this single institution study, SBRT to oligometastatic lymph nodes provided excellent LC and a moderate chemotherapy-free interval with minimal toxicities. Disease progression remains prominent in these patients and larger studies are warranted to identify those who benefit most from SBRT.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.1186/s13014-017-0820-1,,,,

The use of Proton vs X-ray for SBRT is attractive given the advantage of a lack of an exit dose. The exit dose is responsible for high integral dose of radiation in the liver. This significantly limits the ability to administer subsequent courses which is important as it is not uncommon for patients to develop out-of-field recurrences. Objective(s): For the Phase I portion, the objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Proton SBRT for liver metastases. The Phase II portion is to evaluate treatment efficacy defined by local control within irradiated field. Method(s): An IRB approved Phase I/II clinical trial was conducted. Eligible patients had 1-3 liver metastases measuring less than 5c m, and no metastases location within 2 cm of the GI tract. For the Phase I portion, dose escalation was conducted with three dose cohorts. The low, intermediate, and high dose cohorts were planned to receive 36 Gy, 48 Gy, and 60 Gy respectively to the planning target volume (PTV) in 3 fractions (fx). At least 700 cc of normal liver had to receive <15 Gy. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) included acute Grade 3 liver, intestinal or spinal cord toxicity or any Grade 4 toxicity. The MTD was defined as the dose level below that which results in DLT in 2 or more of the 6 patients in the highest dose level cohort. The Phase II portion has commenced, with the dose of 60 Gy in 3 fx. Result(s): Nine patients were enrolled to the Phase I portion. No patient experienced a DLT and dose was escalated to 60 Gy in 3 fx without reaching MTD. Therefore, 60 Gy in 3 fx was continued as the dose for Phase II. Thus far, 6 patients with 9 total lesions are included in the Phase II portion (3 male, 3 female): most common primary, colorectal (4 patients), median tumor diameter 2.8 cm (1.4-3.8 cm), median tumor volume 7.5 cc (1.4-11.1 cc). All patients tolerated treatment well, with only one patient experiencing toxicity (Grade 1 fatigue). With a median follow up of 9.8 months (range 1 33 months), there have been no local failures. Conclusion(s): Interim results of our Phase I/II trial 60 Gy in 3 fx with Proton SBRT suggest excellent local control outcomes not only with minimal toxicity, but also affording the option of subsequent courses for out-of-field liver recurrences. These results may also be able to be incorporated into other trials, such as immunotherapy trials using SBRT to target multiple metastases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

After SRS alone, the median survival is poor (5.6 months). Ipilimumab (Anti CTLA‐4) was the first checkpoint inhibitor to demonstrate a survival benefit in patients with metastatic melanoma. The median survival was more recently estimated at 6 months after initiation of ipilimumab alone for brain metastasis. No prospective studies have evaluated the use of ipilimumab in combination with stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of brain metastasis from MM. Methods: This open‐label, multi‐center, phase 2 study (NCT02662725) evaluated the efficacy of one administration of ipilimumab (10 mg/kg) followed by SRS and the maintenance ipilimumab in a cohort of patients with MM brain metastases. Inclusion criteria included: patients of 18 years or older, performance status 0‐1, fewer than 4 brain metastases on MRI. The primary objective was to show an increase at least 50% of the median overall survival time of patients receiving SRS alone. The secondary endpoints were to determine the safety profile of the combination, the intra‐ and extra‐brain response rate. This study was supported by Bristol‐Myers Squibb. Results: 57 patients (32 males) were enrolled. Median age was 54 (47‐67). The study met his primary endpoint: median survival time was 13.2 m, higher than the median survival time of 5.6 m in the reference population (HR = 0.29; 95%CI = 0.19 to 0.39; p < 0.0001). The disease control rate was 49% (28/57). The most serious treatment‐related adverse events were colitis (10.5%), hepatitis (10.5%), hypophisitis (8.77%) and headhache (8.77%). One radionecrosis was observed. Conclusions: High dose Ipilimumab plus SRS seemed effective with a manageable safety profile in patients with brain MM. Considering that this is the best survival rate ever observed in this setting, these results seem to confirm a synergy in the combination of immunotherapy and radiotherapy and should be confirmed in a randomized trial.",exclusion,,,10.1200/JCO.2018.36.15-suppl.9520,,,,

Type of primary, site of metastases, and number of total lesions were analyzed to determine the efficacy of concurrent SBRT and nelfinavir for prostate, sarcoma, and other solid tumor histologies. Purpose/Objective(s): Patients (pts) with <=5 histologic confirmed metastatic lesions (<= 5.0 cm or <=250 cm3) of lung, liver, lymph nodes, or bone, and good performance status (ECOG <= 2) were eligible. Pts were given 1250 mg of nelfinavir twice daily for 7 days prior to and after a single dose of 15 Gy SBRT per lesion. Responses were evaluated based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. Prognostic variables were assessed using log-rank tests and Cox regression analyses. Result(s): Thirty-seven patients with 68 lesions were treated from January 2014-December 2015. Of 37 patients, 19 (51%) had prostate cancer, 8 had sarcoma (22%), 2 had lung (5%), 2 had breast cancer (5%), and 6 other histologies (16%). Of 68 lesions treated, 38 were in bone (56%), 19 were in lung (28%), 8 were in lymph nodes (12%), and 3 were in liver (4%). The median follow-up was 17.9 months (range, 5-31.5 months). The 6-month (6mo) freedom from local progression (FFLP) by treated lesion for prostate, sarcoma, and other primary tumor sites was 91.7%, 56.3%, and 62.5%, respectively (p<0.0001).

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective study included 117 patients with small HCCs with 1 or 2 nodules. Eighty-two patients received SABR (SABR group), and 35 patients underwent liver resection (resection group). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed. One-to-one matched pairs between the 2 groups were created using propensity score matching to reduce the potential confounding effect of treatment and selection bias. RESULTS: There was no between-group difference in OS and PFS. Before propensity score matching, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS was 96.3%, 81.8%, and 70.0% in the SABR group and 93.9%, 83.1%, and 64.4% in the resection group, respectively (P=.558). The 1-, 3- and 5-year PFS was 81.4%, 50.2%, and 40.7% in the SABR group and 68.0%, 58.3%, and 40.3% in the resection group, respectively (P=.932). After propensity score matching, 33 paired patients were selected from the SABR and resection groups. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS was 100%, 91.8%, and 74.3% in the SABR group and 96.7%, 89.3%, and 69.2% in the resection group, respectively (P=.405).

There was a similarity of hepatotoxicity between the 2 groups. The SABR group showed fewer complications, such as hepatic hemorrhage, hepatic pain, and weight loss. Acute nausea was significantly more frequent in the SABR group than in the resection group. CONCLUSION: For patients with small primary HCC with 1 or 2 nodules and Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, SABR has local effects that are similar to those with liver resection. Stereotactic ablative radiation therapy has an advantage over resection in being less invasive.",inclusion,,resection: surgery?,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.02.095,,,,

We retrospectively reviewed 78 patients with primary and metastatic liver cancers, who underwent SABR using 3 fractions between 2003 and 2011. To examine the incidence of hepatic toxicity, we defined newly developed hepatic toxicity≥grade 2 according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 within 3 months after the end of SABR as a significant adverse event. To identify the predictors for hepatic toxicity, we analyzed several clinical and dosimetric parameters (rV5Gy-rV35Gy: normal liver volume receiving <X Gy, reverse VXGy). Hepatic toxicity≥grade 2 occurred in 10 patients (13%): grade 2 in 9 patients and grade 3 in 1 patient. On univariate analysis, baseline Child-Pugh (CP) score (5 vs. 6-8), normal liver volume, and planning target volume were the significant clinical predictors. All dosimetric parameters were significant: rV20Gy was the most significant predictor. On multivariate analysis, baseline CP score (hazard ratio, 0.026; P=0.001) was the only significant predictor. In conclusion, SABR using 3 fractions in primary and metastatic liver cancers produces low hepatic toxicity, especially in patients with a baseline CP score of 5. However, further studies are needed to minimize hepatic toxicity in patients with baseline CP scores≥6.",exclusion,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2015.30.8.1055,,,,

Methods and materials: 73 primary HCC patients treated were included. Median gross tumor volume (GTV) was 619 cm3 (range: 3-4009 cm3). All patients were given 1-2 cycles of transarterial cisplatin- based chemoembolization (TACE) and had volumetric-modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT) and planning target volume (PTV) based on midV concept [1] and individual tumor breathing amplitudes that were determined from 4D CT. The biological effective dose (BED) calculated with alpha/beta = 10 Gy ranged from 105.6 to 28 Gy (median = 44.8 Gy). The evaluation endpoint was 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) measured from the start of first TACE to the last follow-up. The logistic model was used to fit the 1-year PFS using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). During modelling, treatment doses were converted into BED using alpha/beta of 1.6, 17.2, 7.5, and 30.7 Gy corresponding to four HCC cell lines: HepG2, HepG3, HuH7, and PLC [2]. The averaged value of these cell lines and the common value of 10 Gy were also investigated. Result(s): The model parameters D50, and k representing the BED to achieve 50% PFS and the slope at D50 were given along with the MLE values in Table 1. According to the model, the BED needed to achieve 90% PFS at 1 year is found to be 39 Gy (95% CI: 28.7-49.4) with alpha/beta averaged over four HCC cell lines. Models derived based on the averaged alpha/beta and the clinically used 10 Gy showed similar goodness of fit according to the MLE. Conclusion(s): Model of 1-year PFS showed higher dose is required to achieve satisfactory PFS at 1-year. This was primarily limited by the constraint of liver toxicity for large lesions even basing planning and delivery on the midV concept for PTV reduction.

The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) compared with other local therapies in untreated solitary primary HCC patients. We hypothesized that SBRT shows superior overall survival (OS) to that with TACE and similar LC to that with RFA. Materials/Methods: The eligibility criteria included the following: 1) primary nodular HCC pathologically proven or clinically diagnosed via computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound; 2) no prior surgery, RFA, or TACE for HCC; 3) Child-Pugh score of 7 or less; 4) age of 20-85 years; 5) unsuitability for or refusal of surgery and RFA; 6) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2; 7) appropriate organ functions; and 8) written informed consent. SBRT was performed with 40 Gy delivered in 5 fractions over 5-10 days. The primary endpoint was 3-year OS; the secondary endpoints included local progression-free survival (LPFS), LC, and adverse events. Treatment-related toxicities were evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4. We expected a 70% 3-year OS, with a 50% threshold. The accrual target was 60 patients with an alpha of 0.05, beta of 0.1, 3-year accrual period, and 3-year follow-up period. Result(s): Between January 2014 and July 2018, 36 patients were enrolled; enrollment was closed early due to slow accrual. The median age was 74 years. Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging identified 13 and 23 patients with stage 0 and A disease, respectively. The mean tumor size was 23.3 mm. Four patients' (11.1 %) treatments were combined with transarterial embolization, which involved lipiodol without chemotherapeutic agents. The median follow-up at the time of evaluation was 20.8 months (range, 0.3-56.8 months). The 3-year OS was 77.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 52.9-90.5%), which was superior to the expected 3-year OS. The 3-year LPFS and LC rates were 73.1% (95% CI: 48.1-87.5%) and 90.0% (95% CI: 65.2-97.5%), respectively. Grade 3 or higher toxicities after 3 months are shown in the table, and grade 5 toxicities were not observed. Conclusion(s): LC and OS after SBRT for untreated solitary HCC were excellent despite the patients being unfit for resection and RFA. We could not draw definite conclusions due to early study closure, but our results were very promising. A randomized phase III study is warranted to confirm the effectiveness of SBRT.

Liver metastasis (mets) are even more common with a wide range of malignancies. Management of both liver affections is a challenging task regarding toxicity toward liver functions. In response, NBTXR3, innovative injectable hafnium oxide nanoparticles activated by radiotherapy, was developed to increase the local deposit of energy within the tumor cells without negatively affecting the liver. It is currently evaluated in a phase I/II clinical trial to introduce the use of NBTXR3 with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with HCC or liver mets [NCT02721056]. Method(s): So far, eleven patients (pts) with HCC with/without with Portal Vein Tumor Thrombosis or liver mets were treated with a single intralesional or intraarterial injection of NBTXR3 followed by SBRT (45Gy / 3 fractions / 5 to 7 days). A 3+3 dose escalation design was implemented with five dose levels equivalent to 10%, 15%, 22%, 33% and 45% of the baseline tumor volume. Primary endpoints were the determination of the Recommended Dose and of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs). Secondary endpoints included the local assessment on target lesions by mRECIST via MRI. Pts are followed until disease progression or study cut-off date. Result(s): Enrollment is currently at the third dose level at 22% (1 pt) and completed for the first two levels at 10% (6 pts) and 15% (4 pts). The treatment resulted with no early DLTs, no adverse events (AE) related to NBTXR3 and no serious AE related to the injection or to SBRT. Dispersion and permanence assessments by CT scan confirmed NBTXR3 to stay within the tumor without negatively impacting liver functions nor the reliability of the image-guided radiation therapy. Conclusion(s): Overall, current results observed a safe and well tolerated profile for NBTXR3 indicating an encouraging perspective in pts highly vulnerable to liver complications.

Previous studies have shown that SBRT can stimulate innate and adaptive immunity to potentially augment immunotherapy. In addition, SBRT is used in patients with limited metastatic disease as consolidative approach, showing an improvement overall survival when compared to systemic treatment alone. Combining immunotherapy with ablative therapy is being studied by a number of investigators. While many of these pre-clinical and clinical studies are promising, timing of immunotherapy with SBRT has not be formally studied. Further, few of these studies have addressed treatment of multiple sites of disease and little is known about what molecular changes occur in the tumor microenvironment immediately after ablative therapy. This trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of nivolumab (N) and ipilimumab (I) plus sequential(S) or concurrent(C) SBRT in patients with stage IV NSCLC. Method(s): This is a single-center phase I, open-label, two-arm, randomized platform trial. Eligible patients include those with stage IV NSCLC with >=2 metastatic lesions that meet criteria for SBRT (0.2 cc to 65 cc of viable tumor, larger tumors able to be partially treated up to 65 cc). Eligible patients are simultaneously accrued on arm I (S) and arm II (C) in a 1:1 ratio. Participants in arm I complete SBRT to 2-4 sites followed by initiation of N/I 1-7 days after completion of SBRT. Participants in arm II are treated with N/I within 24-48 hours of SBRT with required SBRT completion to 2-4 sites within two weeks (prior to the second dose of N). Protocol therapy consists of treatment with N 3mg/kg every 2 weeks and I 1mg/kg every 6 weeks for a maximum of 24 months. The primary endpoint is dose-limiting toxicity defined as a >33% rate of grade >=3 toxicity. DLT is defined as any grade >=3 toxicity possibly, likely, or definitely related to SBRT plus N/I (the combination and not the individual components). Secondary endpoints include response rate and progression free survival at 6 months, control rate of treated lesions and non-treated lesions, and comparison of efficacy and toxicity between the arms. Biopsies and blood draws performed pre- and post-SBRT will facilitate molecular correlative studies including investigation of changes in the immune microenvironment induced by the two approaches.

Ablative external beam radiotherapy (XRT) and transarterial radioembolization (TARE) are emerging radiotherapeutic treatments for localized HCC. We sought to evaluate their utilization and efficacy in a large nationwide cohort.Materials and Methods:We conducted an observational study of 2685 patients from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) diagnosed with American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th edition clinical stage I to III HCC between 2004 and 2015, treated with definitive-intent XRT delivered in 1 to 15 fractions or TARE. The association between treatment modality (XRT vs. TARE) and overall survival (OS) was defined using propensity score-weighted Kaplan-Meier estimators and propensity score-weighted multivariable Cox regressions. Result(s):Among 2685 patients, 2007 (74.7%) received TARE and 678 (25.3%) received XRT, with increasing usage for both from 2004 to 2015 (Ptrend<0.001), but with overall greater uptake and absolute usage of TARE. Patients who received TARE were more likely to have elevated alpha fetoprotein and more advanced stage (P<0.05 for all). Median OS was 14.5 months for the entire cohort. XRT was associated with an OS advantage compared with TARE on propensity score-unadjusted analysis (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.79-1.00; P=0.049), but not on propensity score-Adjusted analysis (AHR, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.86-1.13; P=0.829).

The addition of bevacizumab holds promise as a radiosensitizer and is an active agent in metastatic CRC. There is increasing interest in the use of imaging biomarkers as a method to evaluate and predict response to treatment. Dynamic contrast-enhanced CT (DCE-CT) measures perfusion parameters and has been used to evaluate primary CRC tumors and liver metastases. Contrastenhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is another method using a microbubble contrast agent to characterize vascular properties of liver lesions. The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the temporal evolution of perfusion parameters in CRC liver metastases treated with SBRT and bevacizumab. Material and Methods Patients with 1 - 3 liver metastases from CRC were prospectively enrolled in this trial. Bevacizumab was administered for 2 doses 2 weeks apart, with the second dose within 48 hours of starting SBRT. SBRT was delivered in 5 fractions. Functional imaging including DCE-CT and CEUS were performed at three time points: at baseline, just prior to SBRT, and within 7 days post-SBRT. DCE-CT output parameters were permeability surface area (PSA), blood volume (BV), and blood flow (BF). CEUS images were used to calculate a quantitative perfusion index (PI). Patients were then followed with physical and imaging assessments every three months. Results The trial enrolled 11 patients, with 1 dropout. Six patients had a complete set of DCE-CT images (one patient had 2 of 3 scans). Of the 7 evaluable patients, 3, 3 and 1 had evidence of local, distant and simultaneous failure, respectively. Mean PSA and BV decreased in 5 of 6 patients from baseline to post-bevacizumab (-17% +/- 37%, p=0.22 and -25% +/- 33%, p=0.1 respectively), while BF was not affected. BF and PSA was reduced in all 7 patients pre to post-SBRT (-47% +/- 22%, p=0.07 and -40% +/- 21%, p=0.18, respectively) while BV remained stable (0.4% +/- 22%, p=0.8). CEUS was attempted in 10 patients but adequate image acquisition was only technically feasible in 4. CEUS PI significantly decreased from baseline to post bevacizumab (-77% +/- 22%, p=0.048) and had a smaller further decrease after SBRT (-34% +/- 34%, p=0.18). With limited number of patients, there were no differences in changes in any perfusion parameters between patients with and without local failure. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first study in humans that evaluates quantitative CT and US perfusion measures of CRC liver metastases treated with bevacizumab and SBRT. Changes in different measures of perfusion can be detected with these imaging biomarkers. Further study in a larger cohort are needed to better understand temporal changes in perfusion and determine if these changes can be used to predict response to treatment.",exclusion,Wrong intervention,,,,,,

A phase 1 dose-escalation trial was conducted to determine the feasibility and toxicity of Tomotherapy-based SBRT for primary HCC. Materials/Methods: Eligible patients had Child-Turcotte-Pugh's Class (CTP) A or B, were not candidates for resection, had 1-3 lesions and cumulative tumor diameter less than or equal to 6 cm. Abdominal compression and 4-dimensional computed tomography was used during SBRT simulation. Dose-escalation began at 36 Gy in 4 fractions (9 Gy/ fraction) with a subsequent planned escalation of 2 Gy/fraction per dose level. All patients were treated every-other-day with on-board megavoltage CT for image-guidance. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 grade 3 or greater gastrointestinal toxicity. Modified Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) was used to evaluate treatment response and survival was measured from the last day of SBRT. Result(s): Eighteen patients with 22 lesions were enrolled. The median cumulative tumor diameter was 2.1 cm(range, 1.0-4.4 cm). Dose was initially escalated to 52 Gy (13 Gy/fraction) without DLT. The protocol was amended for a further escalation to 60 Gy (15 Gy/fraction). Radiologic complete response (CR) was achieved in 16 patients (88.9%) with median time to CR of 6.0months (range, 0.7-12.3 months). Changes in alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level were well correlated with radiologic response among patients with initial AFP elevation. Nine patients experienced disease progression: 2 local, 5 outfield intrahepatic, and 2 distant failures. No local failure occurred at dose levels 3 and 4. Dose-limiting toxicity was not reached. Grade 3 hematologic toxicity was reported in five patients: all of these patients had grade 1 or 2 hematologic events prior to SBRT. No GI toxicity greater than grade 1 occurred.

Secondary objectives included determining tumor local control (LC) and the frequency of acute grade 2-5 gastrointestinal toxicity as determined by CTCAE (version 4). Purpose/Objective(s): Eligible patients had metastatic lesions from another primary site (up to 5 lesions), primary hepatocellular carcinoma, or cholangiocarcinoma and were referred to radiation oncology for liver SBRT. Histologic confirmation of metastases was encouraged but not required. For patients with a single lesion, dose/fractionation regimens included 15 Gy x 3, 16 Gy x 3, and 18 Gy x 3. For patients with multiple lesions, dose/fractionation regimens included 8 Gy x 5, 10 Gy x 5, and 12 Gy x 5. Determination of dose schedule was based on achieving the highest dose while meeting protocol specified normal tissue constraints (adapted from RTOG 1112). LC was defined as stable disease, partial response, or complete response on imaging. Imaging follow-up was based on PET/CT or MRI imaging every 3 months per standard-of-care. Result(s): Sixteen patients were enrolled on our study from July 2015 to September 2016. Four had HCC, two had cholangiocarcinoma, and ten had hepatic metastases. Eleven patients had a single lesion. Overall, 15 of 16 patients (93.8%) had MRI-guided tri-60Co-RT plans that met our dosimetric constraints. The patient who did not have an acceptable MRI-guided tri-60Co-RT plan also did not have an acceptable LINAC-based plan, so was excluded from the study and treated with a dose-reduced schedule. Twenty lesions were treated in total. The median biologically effective dose (BED, assuming a/b=10) used to treat single lesions was 151 Gy. Among plans in which multiple lesions were treated, the median BED per lesion was 132 Gy. The mean gross tumor volume (GTV) for single lesions was 24.1 ml; when multiple lesions were treated, the mean GTV for each lesion was 8.2 ml. At a median imaging follow-up of 5.8 months, LC was 100%. At a median clinical follow-up of 7.2 months, no grade 2 or higher GI toxicities were seen. Conclusion(s): Nearly all patients referred to radiation oncology at our institution for liver SBRT were eligible to receive MRI-guided tri-60Co-RT at ablative doses, as defined by having treatment plans that met adapted RTOG 1112 constraints. LC at a median imaging follow-up of nearly 6 months was 100%, and no grade 2 or higher GI toxicities were seen. Future studies will investigate the ability of the MRI-guided RT system to reduce treatment planning margins and safely allow further dose escalation.",exclusion,Other study design,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.06.993,,,,

Materials/Methods: Patients with metastatic disease refractory to standard therapies with >=1 lung or liver lesion amenable to SABR and >=1 additional non-contiguous lesion were enrolled in a nonrandomized fashion. All patients were to receive ipilimumab (3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 cycles) plus radiation given either concomitantly (SABR started on day 2 of cycle 1) or sequentially (SABR given 1 week after the 2nd dose of Ipilimumab). The 5 treatment groups were as follows: concomitant liver 50 Gy, concomitant lung 50 Gy, sequential liver 50 Gy, sequential lung 50 Gy, and sequential 60 Gy (lung or liver for larger lesions). 50 Gy was given in 4 fractions and 60 Gy was given in 10 fractions. Toxicity was scored per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 and were evaluated by medical and radiation oncologists. Disease response was scored per the immune-related response criteria (irRC) by an experienced radiologist. Best responses were reported as complete response (CR), partial response (PR; size decrease >=50%), progressive disease (PD; size increase >=25%), or stable disease (SD; not meeting criteria for PR/CR or PD). The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests were used to assess progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): Among 100 patients (20 in each treatment group), the most common primary histologies were adeno-(nZ55) and squamous cell (nZ13) carcinomas. No grade 4-5 toxicity was observed; 27 grade 3 toxicities were related to ipilimumab (colitis [nZ8], diarrhea [nZ7], liver enzyme elevation [nZ3], bilirubin elevation [nZ1], intestinal obstruction [nZ1], hypophysitis [nZ3], and rash [nZ4]). Two grade 3 toxicities were attributed to combined ipilimumab plus SABR: liver enzyme increase (1%) and pneumonitis (1%). The concurrent and sequential lung groups had 45% and 50% of SD, and 10% and 0% PR, respectively. The concurrent and sequential liver groups showed 35% and 30% of SD, and 5% and 0% PR, respectively. Within the sequential 60 Gy group, 60% showed a favorable response. Lesions from nonesmall cell lung cancer had the highest rate of clinical benefit (SD + PR) at 67%. There was no CR to report. Median PFS time for all patients was 5 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.7e7.2) and median OS time was 12 months (95% CI 9.3e14.6). At 12 months, PFS and OS were better for the sequential lung group than for the sequential liver group (PFS PZ.055, CIZ 3.7e6.4; OS PZ.059, CIZ7.9e20). However, no differences in PFS (PZ.2) or OS (PZ.3) were found between the concurrent lung and liver groups. Conclusion(s): These data suggest that combinations of ipilimumab and SABR have acceptable toxicity profiles and sequential treatment may provide significant clinical benefits in term of response and survival, warranting further evaluation.",exclusion,Wrong intervention,,,,,,
random-journal.pdf,LivP132,"A., Takeda",2016,eng,LIV.P:#2,Phase 2 study of stereotactic body radiotherapy and optional transarterial chemoembolization for solitary hepatocellular carcinoma not amenable to resection and radiofrequency ablation,"BACKGROUND: Curative treatment options for patients with early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) include resection, liver transplantation, and percutaneous ablation therapy. However, even patients with solitary HCC are not always amenable to these treatments. The authors prospectively investigated the clinical outcomes of patients who received stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for solitary HCC. METHODS: A phase 2 study involving SBRT and optional transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was conducted in patients with Child-Pugh grade A or B and underlying, solitary HCC (greatest tumor dimension, ≤4 cm) who were unsuitable candidates for resection and radiofrequency ablation. The prescription dose was 35 to 40 grays in 5 fractions. The primary endpoint was 3-year local tumor control. RESULTS: From 2007 to 2012, 101 patients were enrolled, and 90 were evaluable with a median follow-up of 41.7 months (range, 6.8-96.2 months). Thirty-two patients were treatment-naïve, 20 were treated for newly diagnosed intrahepatic failure, and 38 were treated for residual or recurrent HCC as salvage therapy. Thirty-two patients did not receive TACE, 48 received insufficient TACE, and 10 attained full lipiodol accumulation. The 3-year local control rate was 96.3%, the 3-year liver-related cause-specific survival rate was 72.5%, and the overall survival rate was 66.7%. Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities were observed in 6 patients, and 8 patients had Child-Pugh scores that worsened by 2 points. CONCLUSIONS: SBRT achieved high local control and overall survival with feasible toxicities for patients with solitary HCC, despite rather stringent conditions. SBRT can be effective against solitary HCC in treatment-naive, intrahepatic failure, residual disease, and recurrent settings, taking advantage of its distinctive characteristics.

A mouse model of brain metastases demonstrated high penetration and retention of SN‐38 in CNS lesions, resulting in decreased size of CNS lesions and improved survival at concentrations clinically achieved at the recommended dose of EP in patients (pts) (Adkins et al, BMC Cancer 2015). A previous phase 3 trial comparing single‐agent EP to treatment of physician's choice (TPC) was conducted in 852 pts with advanced breast cancer (BC) (Perez et al, Lancet Oncol 2015). Although the primary efficacy endpoint of improved survival was not met (HR 0.087; p value = 0.08), a subset of 67 pts who entered the study with stable brain metastases demonstrated improved overall survival (HR 0.51 [95% CI 0304 ‐ 0.858]; p < 0.01). A phase 3 trial has therefore been designed for this population of high unmet medical need. Trial Design: Pts with MBC with stable brain metastases will be randomized 1:1 to receive either single‐agent EP or TPC in an open‐label, randomized, multicenter Phase 3 study. Key Entry Criteria: Adults, with ECOG PS 0 or 1 with adequate liver, kidney and marrow function. All pts must have received prior therapy with an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine (ATC) (these drugs may have been administered in the neo/adjuvant or locally advanced/metastatic setting); pts must have had 1 prior cytotoxic regimen for MBC (triple negative BC); 2 prior cytotoxic regimens and 1 prior hormone therapy (hormone‐receptor+ BC); or 2 prior cytotoxic regimens and 1 prior HER2‐targeted therapy (HER2+ BC). Pts are required to have undergone definitive local therapy of brain metastases (either whole brain radiation; stereotactic radiation or surgical resection); signs and symptoms of brain metastases must be stable with steroids either unchanged or decreasing for ≥ 7 days prior to randomization. Prior toxicities must have resolved to ≤ Grade 1 (except sensory neuropathy ≤ Grade 2 and complete resolution of prior diarrhea). Methods: Primary efficacy endpoint is OS. Key secondary endpoints: ORR by RECIST v1.1, clinical benefit rate (ORR+SD ≥ 6 months), PFS by RANO‐BM and QoL. EP is given IV at 145 mg/m2 over 90‐min every 21 days without premedications. Pts randomized to TPC must receive 1 of the following: eribulin, ixabepilone, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel or nab‐paclitaxel (the agent must be available at the treating institution). Pts are stratified by region, ECOG PS and receptor status (TNBC, HER2+ or HR+/HER2‐). Target Accrual: ∼350 pts will be randomized to obtain the number of deaths required at 90% power to detect a statistically significant improvement in OS; 1 interim analysis will occur when 50% of the deaths are reported (130 events). PK sampling is performed in a subset of pts; UGT1A1 testing will occur in pts randomized to EP. Plasma ctDNA will be assessed at baseline for potential predictive markers of efficacy.

Stereotactic, magnetic resonance (MR)-guided online-adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) may improve SBRT's therapeutic ratio. This prospective Phase I trial assessed feasibility and potential advantages of SMART to treat abdominal malignancies. MATERIALS/METHODS: Twenty patients with oligometastatic or unresectable primary liver (n = 10) and non-liver (n = 10) abdominal malignancies underwent SMART. Initial plans prescribed 50 Gy/5 fractions (BED 100 Gy) with goal 95% PTV coverage by 95% of prescription, subject to hard OAR constraints. Daily real-time online-adaptive plans were created as needed, based on daily setup MR-image-set tumor/OAR ""anatomy-of-the-day"" to preserve hard OAR constraints, escalate PTV dose, or both. Treatment times, patient outcomes, and dosimetric comparisons between initial and adaptive plans were prospectively recorded. RESULTS: Online adaptive plans were created at time of treatment for 81/97 fractions, due to initial plan violation of OAR constraints (61/97) or observed opportunity for PTV dose escalation (20/97). Plan adaptation increased PTV coverage in 64/97 fractions. Zero Grade ≥ 3 acute (<6 months) treatment-related toxicities were observed. DISCUSSION: SMART is clinically deliverable and safe, allowing PTV dose escalation and/or simultaneous OAR sparing compared to non-adaptive abdominal SBRT.",exclusion,,,10.1016/j.radonc.2017.11.032,,,,
random-journal.pdf,LivP135,"E., Chajon",2019,English,LIV.M:#2;LIV.P:#2,Phase I/II trial of hafnium oxide nanoparticles activated by SBRT in the treatment of liver cancers,"Purpose or Objective Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver metastasis (mets) present with a wide range of underlying liver dysfunctions and concomitant malignancies. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is well-tolerated and a valuable alternative for patients who are not eligible for invasive procedures. Yet, like all radiation therapy (RT) techniques, the energy dose deposit to tumor cells is limited by the surrounding healthy tissues. NBTXR3, composed of hafnium oxide nanoparticles, was designed to effectively absorb ionizing radiation and augment the dose deposit within the tumor cells only when activated by RT, thereby increasing tumor-specific physical killing through DNA damage/cell destruction and enhancing the immunogenic tumor cell death. Material and Methods Patients suffering from primary HCC (with/without portal vein tumor thrombosis) or liver mets were included and treated with a single intralesional injection (IL) of NBTXR3 followed by SBRT (45 Gy/3 fractions/5 to 7 days). The phase I part of the study was designed as a 3 + 3 escalation dose with tested dose levels at 10%, 15%, 22% and 33% of baseline tumor volume. Primary endpoints include the determination of the recommended dose and incidence of early dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). Secondary endpoints include assessment of global safety profile, characterization of the body kinetic profile, liver function evaluated by Child-Pugh score (CPS), AST to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), and response rate (mRECIST/RECIST v1.1). Results The enrollment is complete in the first 3 dose levels: 10% (6 pts), 15% (4 pts) and 22% (4 pts) and is ongoing at the last IL dose level at 33% with no early DLTs, no AE related to NBTXR3, and no serious AE related to RT or the injection. So far, four AEs related to the IL were observed (Malaise, grade 2; two Abdominal pain, grade 3 and Bilateral pleural effusion, grade 1) at dose level 10%, 15% and 22% respectively. NBTXR3 remained localized within the tumor, validating the relevance of the single IL. No relevant change in CPS or APRI was observed over time which is consistent with the low toxicity observed. In 7 HCC pts evaluable for response, the mRECIST assessment by MRI on target lesions resulted in the following best observed response: 3 complete responses, 3 partial responses and 1 stable disease. In 5 evaluable liver mets pts, the RECIST v1.1 assessment by MRI on target lesions resulted in the following best observed response: 1 partial response, 3 stable disease and 1 local progressive disease. Conclusion NBTXR3 was well tolerated and showed a promising safety profile. Recruitment at the highest dose level of 33% is ongoing for the IL part and, once completed, will be followed by the expansion phase. NBTXR3 is also being evaluated in 6 other clinical trials, including a phase II/III trial in soft tissue sarcoma [NCT02379845] and phase I/II trials in prostate [NCT02805894], head and neck [NCT01946867] and rectum cancers [NCT02465593].Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",exclusion,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0167-8140%2819%2930701-7,,,,

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a well-tolerated alternative for inoperable patients (pts), yet maximal dose to the tumor is limited by potential toxicity to surrounding healthy tissues. Otherwise inert, NBTXR3 (hafnium oxide nanoparticles) when activated by ionizing radiation (RT) augments dose deposit within tumor cells, increasing tumor cell death compared to RT alone. A phase I/II clinical trial is underway to evaluate NBTXR3 activated by SBRT in pts with HCC or liver mets [NCT02721056]. Method(s): A 3+3 dose escalation was utilized in the phase I. Pts received a single intralesional injection (ILI) of NBTXR3 followed by SBRT (45 Gy/3 fractions/5-7 days), with tested NBTXR3 dose levels of 10, 15, 22 and 33% of baseline tumor volume. Primary endpoints included recommended phase II dose(s) identification and DLT. Secondary endpoints included global safety profile assessment, liver function by Child-Pugh score (CPS), AST to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), and response rate (mRECIST/ RECIST v1.1). Result(s): Four dose escalation levels are finalized (n=17): 6 pts at 10% (2 SBRT doses tested due to organ constraints), 4 pts at 15 and 22% (due to fiducial displacement and ILI site shift) and 3 pts at 33%. No NBTXR3 related DLTs were observed. Related AEs observed: one malaise (G2, 10%); 2 abdominal pain, (G3, 15%); one bilateral pleural effusion (G1, 22%), one bile duct stenosis (G3, 22%) with associated disease recurrence and SBRT; one fatigue (G1, 33%). There were no clinically meaningful changes to CPS or APRI and CT-scan demonstrated absence of NBTXR3 in surrounding healthy tissues. In 7 evaluable HCC pts, best mRECIST target lesion responses were: 3 CR, 4 PR. In 5 evaluable mets pts, best target lesion responses were: 2 PR, 1 SD, 2 PD. Conclusion(s): NBTXR3 was well tolerated and showed preliminary anti-tumor activity, supporting a protocol amendment to evaluate an additional NBTXR3 dose level (42%).

In patients with a limited number of progressing lesions, local ablation therapy (LAT) of progressive lesions followed by re-initiation of TKI has shown promise in retrospective studies but to date this strategy has not been testing in prospective fashion. Method(s): As part of an IRB approved open label prospective phase II trial (NCT01573702), patients with EGFR mutated NSCLC and immediate progression on a TKI in < 5 locations were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to progressing lesions followed by re-initiation of erlotinib. Our primary endpoint is PFS, and we hypothesize that it will be at least 3 months. Result(s): 25/40 planned patients have been enrolled and data is available on 23. By local reporting, 14 had exon 19, 5 had exon 21, 1 had compound exon 18 and exon 20, 1 had compound exon 19 and EML4/ALK and 2 were unknown. 65% were female, all were non-Hispanic white, median age 62.5 (range 43-85), PS0 65.2%/PS1 34.8%, median Charlson Comorbidity Index 6, and 71.4% were never smokers. Median number of lesions treated was 1 (range 1-3). Treated lesions included lung (14), bone (6), liver (3) and brain (2). There were no G3-4 AEs to SRS. Two subjects had grade 3 rash on erlotinib. Median PFS post treatment was 5.8 months (95% CI, 2.5 to 11.3) and median OS was 2.9 years (95% CI 1.1 to 2.9). Conclusion(s): LAT resulted in a modest extension in the duration of targeted therapy, supporting retrospective data in this population.

In selected patients with oligometastatic disease confined to liver, surgical resection improves overall survival (OS). Approximately 70-90% of liver metastases, however, are unresectable and a safe and effective alternative therapeutic option is necessary for these patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term outcomes of SBRT for unresectable liver metastases and to analyze prognostic factors affecting OS of these selected oligometastatic patients. Material and Methods Patients with 1 to 3 unresectable liver metastases, with maximum individual tumor diameters less than 6 cm and a Karnofsky Performance Status of at least 70, were enrolled and treated by SBRT on a phase 2 clinical trial. Dose prescription was 75 Gy on 3 consecutive fractions. SBRT was delivered using the volumetric modulated arc therapy by RapidArc (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) technique. Primary end point was in field local control (LC), secondary end points were overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS) and toxicity. Results Between February 2010 and September 2011, a total of 61 patients with 76 lesions were enrolled in this phase II trial, with a median follow-up time of 1.9 years. One-, threeand five- years LC rates were 94%, 78% and 78 %, respectively, with a median LC of 1.7 years. Median OS was 2.3 years and the survival rates were 83%, 30% and 21% at 1, 3 and 5 years, respectively. Univariate analysis showed two independent positive prognostic factors affecting survival: female sex (p = 0.012) and primary tumour (p = 0.001). Toxicity was moderate. One patient experienced G3 late chest wall pain, which resolved within 1 year from SBRT. No cases of RILD were detected. Conclusion Long-term results of this Phase II study suggest the efficacy and safety of SBRT for unresectable liver metastases at 5 years of follow-up. Selection of cases with positive prognostic factors may improve long-term survival of these oligometastastic patients and may confirm the role of SBRT as an effective alternative local therapy for liver metastases.",exclusion,,,,,,,

Each DEB-TACE treatment utilized 1 vial of 100-300 micron LC Beads (BTG) loaded with 50 mg of doxorubicin. SBRT was delivered from 35 to 50 Gy in 5 fractions. The primary end-point of the study was best objective response by mRECIST (measured 1 month post-treatment and every 3 months thereafter). Secondary endpoints were progression free survival (PFS), cancer specific survival (CSS), overall survival (OS) assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): From 2014 to 2017, 20 patients were enrolled in a single institution with a median follow of 13 months (range 1-30). Baseline patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. Every patient completed the protocol as planned except one who only received DEB-TACEx1 before SBRT.19 patients had at least one post treatment scan to assess mRECIST response (one patient lost to follow up). Best objective response in the target lesion was 95%: 74% complete response (n = 14), 21% partial response (n = 4), 0%stable disease, and 5% progression of disease (n = 1). PFS at 1 year was 66%, CSS at 1 year was 88%, and OS at 1 year was 69%. Conclusion(s): Preliminary results from this Phase II trial show very promising response rates when combining TACE + SBRT in large, unresectable HCC with excellent PFS and CSS at one year. These preliminary data are currently being confirmed in an expanded cohort. (Table Presented).",exclusion,,,,,,,

Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is an emerging radiotherapy technique to treat oligometastases that require further prospective population-based toxicity estimates. Method(s): This is a non-randomized phase II trial where all participants will receive experimental SABR treatment to all sites of newly diagnosed or progressing oligometastatic disease. We will accrue 200 patients to assess toxicity associated with this experimental treatment. The study was powered to give a 95% confidence on the risk of late grade 4 toxicity, anticipating a < 5% rate of grade 4 toxicity. Discussion(s): SABR treatment of oligometastases is occurring off-trial at a high rate, without sufficient evidence of its efficacy or toxicity. This trial will provide necessary toxicity data in a population-based cohort, using standardized doses and organ at risk constraints, while we await data on efficacy from randomized phase III trials.

Method(s): 571 patients diagnosed with T1a-T3N0M0 lung cancer were treated with radiotherapy between January 6, 2001 and August 8, 2014 at the Ottawa Hospital, with patient outcomes (local, regional, or distant lung cancer recurrences) tracked until October 25, 2016. 280 patients were excluded from analysis; Exclusion criteria includes patients who received radiotherapy prior to 2003, patients who did not receive a PET scan within four months of initiation of radiotherapy, and patients who died of causes other than lung cancer during the follow-up period. Of the 291 patients, segmentation was performed on 161 PET scans including the primary pulmonary lesion, up to two additional pulmonary nodules, and any hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes. Background liver, splenic and blood pool values were assessed with spherical regions of interest (ROI). Uptake within pleural or pericardial fluid was measured as an SUVmax. On the CT scan, variables included the distance of the primary lung tumour from the mediastinum/chest wall, and the length of the interface between the primary lung tumour and the mediastinum/chest wall. Binary variables included subpleural or subpericardial fat blurring, pericardial effusions, pneumothoraxes and lesions simultaneously contacting the chest wall/mediastinum. All computations were performed using R version 3.3.2. Multivariate imputation was performed using the ""mice"" package to predict missing variables, including predicted FEV1 (25.7% missing), pack years of smoking (10% missing), and weight loss (2.5% missing). All categorical variables were converted to binary dummy variables using the ""caret"" package. Right-skewed variables were log-transformed. All numeric variables were normalized to a fraction between 0 and 1. Relevant predictors were selected by random forest feature selection using the ""randomForest"" package; Clinical factors included in the machine learning algorithm include age, pack years of smoking, Eastern cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status, gender, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCMI) and weight loss. Treatment parameters entered include biological equivalent dose (BED10), equivalent dose (EQD2) and the time interval between the PET/CT and initiation of radiotherapy. Of the 161 patients analyzed, 21% demonstrated recurrent cancer within two years. The 161 patients were randomly divided into a group of 106 patients to train the neural network, and 51 patients on which to test the predictions of the neural network. The neural network was created from the predictor variables within the training patient dataset using the ""neuralnet"" package. Result(s): The trained neural network was able to predict which patients would experience a recurrence within two years with a sensitivity of 60% and a positive predictive value of 69%. The neural network was also able to predict which patients would not recur within two years with a specificity of 88% and a negative predictive value of 82% for an overall accuracy of 79% (Table 1). Conclusion(s): With an accuracy of 79% in predicting two-year lung cancer recurrence post-SBRT, the neural network is effective in predicting which patient's cancer will recur within two years post-SBRT. The accuracy of the neural network would likely benefit from analyzing even greater numbers of patients in the training dataset. Furthermore, adding more predictors, such as mutation status, radiomic nodule assessment, growth rates, or more detailed radiotherapy treatment volumes may improve accuracy. Machine learning strategies will likely aid in creating patient-specific treatment plans, as accuracy continues to improve. Further research is required to determine whether machine-learning guided treatment plans could improve patient outcomes, and/or reduce health-care expenditures.",exclusion,No comparator,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed 96 patients treated with SBRT for primary (53%) or metastatic (47%) liver tumors between March 2006 and November 2013. The central HB tract (cHBT) was defined by a 15-mm expansion of the portal vein from the splenic confluence to the first bifurcation of left and right portal veins. Patients were censored for toxicity upon local progression or additional liver-directed therapy. HB toxicities were graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. To compare different SBRT fractionations, doses were converted to biologically effective doses (BED) by using the standard linear quadratic model α/β = 10 (BED10). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 12.7 months after SBRT. Median BED10 was 85.5 Gy (range: 37.5-151.2). The median number of fractions was 5 (range: 1-5), with 51 patients (53.1%) receiving 5 fractions and 29 patients (30.2%) receiving 3 fractions. In total, there were 23 (24.0%) grade 2+ and 18 (18.8%) grade 3+ HB toxicities. Nondosimetric factors predictive of grade 3+ HB toxicity included cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) histology (P<.0001), primary liver tumor (P=.0087), and biliary stent (P<.0001). Dosimetric parameters most predictive of grade 3+ HB toxicity were volume receiving above BED10 of 72 Gy (VBED1072) ≥ 21 cm(3) (relative risk [RR]: 11.6, P<.0001), VBED1066 ≥ 24 cm(3) (RR: 10.5, P<.0001), and mean BED10 (DmeanBED10) cHBT ≥14 Gy (RR: 9.2, P<.0001), with VBED1072 and VBED1066 corresponding to V40 and V37.7 for 5 fractions and V33.8 and V32.0 for 3 fractions, respectively. VBED1072 ≥ 21 cm(3), VBED1066 ≥ 24 cm(3), and DmeanBED10 cHBT ≥14 Gy were consistently predictive of grade 3+ toxicity on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: VBED1072, VBED1066, and DmeanBED10 to cHBT are associated with HB toxicity.

A functional map, generated from hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scans, is used to maximize the functional residual capacity of liver receiving < 15 Gy (FRC HIDA). We present initial results of a prospective trial evaluating FLIGHT vs standard planning and update our institutional experience. Method(s): Eligible patients were >= 18 yo with 1 or 2 liver malignancy and Child-Pugh <= B7. Liver function was assessed with HIDA and blood chemistry at baseline, mid-treatment, and 3, 6, and 12 months post SBRT. Both standard and FLIGHT (optimized to avoid high functioning liver) plans were generated for each patient. Treating MDs were blinded to planning technique before selecting the treatment plan. The primary endpoint was to show > 5% increase in FRC HIDA in 3/15 pts. Secondary endpoints included the rate FLIGHT plans were selected and changes in HIDA and other liver function tests. Prior institutional experience included 27 pts with FLIGHT planned retrospectively.

To increase this tumor response, immune targeting agents can be combined with SBRT We hypothesize that the anti-PDLI agent Durvalumab will enhance immune response following SBRT targeting oligometastatic lesions. In this multicenter randomized phase II trial, we therefore propose to assess the comparative efficacy of SBRT with or without Durvalumab (MEDI4736) in oligometastatic recurrent hormone sensitive prostate cancer patients. Method(s): Patients with PCa were eligible if they had a biochemical recurrence following treatment with curative intent, with a maximum of 5 bone or lymph node metastases, seen only on FCH-PET CT or Ga-PSMA PET CT, not seen on conventional imaging assessments (bone scan or thorax, abdomen and pelvis CT scan). Main exclusion criteria are serum testosterone level < 8.5 nmol/ml, PSA doubling time less than 6 months, lung, brain, liver or other visceral metastases, any prior immune therapy. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to either SBRT + Durvalumab, or SBRT alone, with a stratification by investigation center, and number of metastases (1 vs 2-5). Durvalumab (1500 mg/cycle) will be started one month prior to SBRT to be able to evaluate PSA and immune response to the drug.

This pilot study evaluates the addition of stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) following TACE in unresectable HCC patients with primary endpoints of tolerability and local tumor control. Materials/Methods: Patients with a single HCC lesion 3-8 cm, 3 lesions none over 5 cm, or lesions <3 cm in unfavorable locations were eligible following at least one TACE procedure. Multidisciplinary review of post-TACE imaging deemed all patients ineligible for transplantation or surgical resection at time of enrollment. SRT was delivered within 45 days of enrollment to a dose of 45 Gy in 3 fractions utilizing image-guidance on a linear accelerator. Between 2009 and 2014, 17 patients were treated on protocol (PC, protocol cohort) and 24 patients were treated per protocol though failed to meet inclusion criteria (OPC, off protocol cohort). All OPC exclusions were due to large tumor size and/or location, medical comorbidity or history of previous malignancy. Characteristics between cohorts were compared with T-test, Wilcoxon test, or Fisher's exact test when appropriate. Median time to intrahepatic tumor progression (TTP), median survival (MS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Result(s): There were no significant differences in age, race, time to initial TACE, or total TACE procedures between the PC and OPC. Mean tumor size in the PC was 4.6 cm and in the OPC was 5.1 cm (P = 0.652). Median intervals between TACE and SRT completions were 69.5 days and 89 days for the PC and the OPC (P = 0.063). No patient experienced > grade 2 acute toxicity. Intrahepatic recurrences occurred in 7/17 (41.2%) PC patients and 6/24 (25%) OPC patients (P = 0.273) with 2 and 4 in-field recurrences, respectively. TTP was 30 months among the PC and was not reached among the OPC (P = 0.391). No patient had isolated distant metastasis at time of first recurrence. OS for the PC and the OPC was 82.3% and 29.2%, respectively, with a median follow-up of 27.7 and 20.1 months. MS was 28.9 months for the OPC and was not reached for the PC (P = 0.046). A total of 7 patientsd3 in the PC (17.7%) and 4 in the OPC (16.7%)dwere successfully down-staged for curative liver transplantation with no evidence of active tumor at the SRT site on explant pathology. Conclusion(s): Combination of TACE followed by SRT is well-tolerated and demonstrates excellent local tumor control and MS as compared to our institution's historical outcomes with TACE alone. This held true among both highly-selected patients as well as those with suboptimal performance statuses and tumor sizes, with a substantial number of patients treated both on and off protocol successfully down-staged for curative transplantation.

Secondary endpoints were local control (LC), overall survival (OS) and toxicity. Methods and materials: Inclusion criteria were the following: oligometastatic breast cancer with <=5 metastatic sites, FDG‐PET/CT staging, no brain metastases, primary tumor controlled. Radiotherapy could be delivered using stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) technique or fractionated intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). SBRT consisted of 30‐45. Gy in 3 fractions, while IMRT was delivered to a total dose of 60. Gy in 25 fractions. We hypothesized that radical radiation therapy could increase the PFS from 30% (according to the published literature) to 50% at two years. Results: 54 Patients with 92 metastatic lesions were enrolled. Forty‐four were treated with SBRT, and 10 with IMRT. Forty‐eight (89%) patients received a form of systemic therapy concomitantly to radiation therapy. Sites of metastatic disease were the following: bones 60 lesions, lymph nodes 23 lesions, lung 4 lesions, liver 5 lesions. After a median follow‐up of 30. months (range, 6‐55. months), 1‐ and 2‐year PFS was 75% and 53%, respectively. Two‐year LC and OS were 97% and 95%, respectively. Radiation therapy was well tolerated, and no Grade >=3 toxicity was documented. Grade 2 toxicity were pain and fatigue in 2 cases. Conclusions: Patients with oligometastatic breast cancer treated with radical radiotherapy to all metastatic sites may achieve long‐term progression‐free survival, without significant treatment‐related toxicity. While waiting for data from randomized trials, the use of radical radiation therapy to all metastatic sites in patients with oligometastatic breast cancer should be considered a valuable option, and its recommendation should be individualized.

Secondary endpoints were local control (LC), overall survival (OS) and toxicity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Inclusion criteria were the following: oligometastatic breast cancer with ≤5 metastatic sites, FDG-PET/CT staging, no brain metastases, primary tumor controlled. Radiotherapy could be delivered using stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) technique or fractionated intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). SBRT consisted of 30-45Gy in 3 fractions, while IMRT was delivered to a total dose of 60Gy in 25 fractions. We hypothesized that radical radiation therapy could increase the PFS from 30% (according to the published literature) to 50% at two years. RESULTS: 54 Patients with 92 metastatic lesions were enrolled. Forty-four were treated with SBRT, and 10 with IMRT. Forty-eight (89%) patients received a form of systemic therapy concomitantly to radiation therapy. Sites of metastatic disease were the following: bones 60 lesions, lymph nodes 23 lesions, lung 4 lesions, liver 5 lesions. After a median follow-up of 30months (range, 6-55months), 1- and 2-year PFS was 75% and 53%, respectively. Two-year LC and OS were 97% and 95%, respectively. Radiation therapy was well tolerated, and no Grade ≥3 toxicity was documented. Grade 2 toxicity were pain and fatigue in 2 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with oligometastatic breast cancer treated with radical radiotherapy to all metastatic sites may achieve long-term progression-free survival, without significant treatment-related toxicity. While waiting for data from randomized trials, the use of radical radiation therapy to all metastatic sites in patients with oligometastatic breast cancer should be considered a valuable option, and its recommendation should be individualized.",inclusion,,,10.1016/j.radonc.2017.08.032,,,,

Because there are limited prospective comparative data for these treatment modalities, we aimed to compare the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) versus stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) by using the National Cancer Database. Method(s): We conducted an observational study to compare the effectiveness of RFA versus SBRT in nonsurgically managed patients with stage I or II HCC. Overall survival was compared by using propensity score-weighted and propensity score-matched analyses based on patient-, facility-, and tumor-level characteristics. A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of severe fibrosis/cirrhosis. In addition, we performed exploratory analyses to determine the effectiveness of RFA and SBRT in clinically relevant patient subsets. Result(s): Overall, 3,684 (92.6%) and 296 (7.4%) nonsurgically managed patients with stage I or II HCC received RFA or SBRT, respectively. After propensity matching, 5-year overall survival was 29.8% (95% CI, 24.5% to 35.3%) in the RFA group versus 19.3% (95% CI, 13.5% to 25.9%) in the SBRT group (P < .001). Inverse probability-weighted analysis yielded similar results. The benefit of RFA was consistent across all subgroups examined and was robust to the effects of severe fibrosis/cirrhosis. Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that treatment with RFA yields superior survival compared with SBRT for nonsurgically managed patients with stage I or II HCC. Even though our results are limited by the biases related to the retrospective study design, we believe that, in the absence of a randomized clinical trial, our findings should be considered when recommending local ablative therapy for localized unresectable HCC.Copyright © 2018 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",exclusion,Wrong comparator,,10.1200/JCO.2017.75.3228,,,,

We have previously identified a multigene expression index for tumor radiosensitivity (RSI) with validation in multiple independent cohorts. In this study, we assessed RSI in liver metastases and assessed our clinical outcomes after SBRT based on primary histology. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients were identified from our prospective, observational protocol. The previously tested RSI 10 gene assay was run on samples and calculated using the published algorithm. An independent cohort of 33 patients with 38 liver metastases treated with SBRT was used for clinical correlation. RESULTS: A total of 372 unique metastatic liver lesions were identified for inclusion from our prospective, institutional metadata pool. The most common primary histologies for liver metastases were colorectal adenocarcinoma (n=314, 84.4%), breast adenocarcinoma (n=12, 3.2%), and pancreas neuroendocrine (n=11, 3%). There were significant differences in RSI of liver metastases based on histology. The median RSIs for liver metastases in descending order of radioresistance were gastrointestinal stromal tumor (0.57), melanoma (0.53), colorectal neuroendocrine (0.46), pancreas neuroendocrine (0.44), colorectal adenocarcinoma (0.43), breast adenocarcinoma (0.35), lung adenocarcinoma (0.31), pancreas adenocarcinoma (0.27), anal squamous cell cancer (0.22), and small intestine neuroendocrine (0.21) (P<.0001). The 12-month and 24-month Kaplan-Meier rates of local control (LC) for colorectal lesions from the independent clinical cohort were 79% and 59%, compared with 100% for noncolorectal lesions (P=.019), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis, we found significant differences based on primary histology.

METHODS: From 2005 to 2012, 28 patients underwent SRS as the primary treatment in spine metastasis from HCC. Based on sex, age, number of spine metastasis, Child-Pugh classification, interval from original tumor to spine metastasis, and year of treatment, 28 patients who underwent RT were paired. Outcomes of interest were pain relief, progression free survival, toxicities, and further treatment. RESULTS: The perioperative visual analog scale (VAS) decrease was larger in SRS group than in RT group, but the difference was not significant (3.7 vs. 2.8, p=0.13). When pain medication was adjusted, the number of patients with complete (n=6 vs.3) or partial (n=12 vs.13) relief was larger in SRS group than in RT group; however, the difference was not significant (p=0.83). There was no significant difference in progression free survival (p=0.48). In SRS group, 32.1% of patients had 1 or more toxicities whereas the percentage in RT group was 63.0%, a significant difference (p=0.04). Six SRS patients and 7 RT patients received further intervention at the treated segment. CONCLUSION: Clinical and radiological outcome were not significantly different between the two treatments.

The primary endpoint is to test the safety of SBRT for the treatment of 2 to 4 multiple lesions in several anatomic sites in a multi-institutional setting. Because of the technical challenges inherent to treating multiple lesions as their spatial separation decreases, we present the technical requirements for NRG-BR001 and the rationale for their selection. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with controlled primary tumors of breast, non-small cell lung, or prostate are eligible if they have 2 to 4 metastases distributed among 7 extracranial anatomic locations throughout the body. Prescription and organ-at-risk doses were determined by expert consensus. Credentialing requirements include (1) irradiation of the Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core phantom with SBRT, (2) submitting image guided radiation therapy case studies, and (3) planning the benchmark. Guidelines for navigating challenging planning cases including assessing composite dose are discussed. RESULTS: Dosimetric planning to multiple lesions receiving differing doses (45-50 Gy) and fractionation (3-5) while irradiating the same organs at risk is discussed, particularly for metastases in close proximity (≤5 cm). The benchmark case was selected to demonstrate the planning tradeoffs required to satisfy protocol requirements for 2 nearby lesions. Examples of passing benchmark plans exhibited a large variability in plan conformity. DISCUSSION: NRG-BR001 was developed using expert consensus on multiple issues from the dose fractionation regimen to the minimum image guided radiation therapy guidelines. Credentialing was tied to the task rather than the anatomic site to reduce its burden. Every effort was made to include a variety of delivery methods to reflect current SBRT technology. Although some simplifications were adopted, the successful completion of this trial will inform future designs of both national and institutional trials and would allow immediate clinical adoption of SBRT trials for oligometastases.",exclusion,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prro.2016.05.004,,,,

This single-institution case series evaluates the safety and efficacy of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the management of metastatic HB. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 2008 and February 2015, RFA was used as part of multidisciplinary management for HB recurrence or metastasis in 5 children (median 5.0 years old) in an attempt to provide locoregional control and preclude additional surgery. Combined local treatments of 38 metachronous metastases included surgical metastasectomy (14 lesions: 7 lung, 7 liver), percutaneous RFA (23 lesions: 21 lung, 1 liver, 1 bone), and stereotactic radiotherapy (1 liver lesion). RESULTS: For lesions treated with RFA (median diameter 6 mm, range 3-15 mm), local control was achieved in 22/23 metastases (95.6%) with median follow-up of 30.1 months after RFA (range 18.9-65.7). Median hospitalization was 3 days (2-7), with major complications limited to 1 pneumothorax requiring temporary small-caliber chest tube. Four children remain in complete remission with median follow-up of 67 months (range 41.2-88.8) after primary tumor resection, with mean disease-free survival of 31.7 months after last local treatment. One child succumbed to rapidly progressive disease 12 months after RFA (23.9 months after primary tumor resection).

METHODS: Consecutive patients with primary (hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC] or cholangiocarcinoma [CCC]) or secondary liver cancer (LM), with intrahepatic recurrence or progression after SBRT, underwent re-SBRT in 3 to 12 fractions with a median time of 15 (range 2-66) months between treatments. RESULTS: In all, 24 patients which were previously treated with SBRT (30 lesions) were retreated with SBRT for ""in- and out-of-field"" recurrences (2nd SBRT: n = 28, 3rd SBRT: n = 2). The median follow-up after re-irradiation was 14 months. The median prescribed dose for the first SBRT was 46.5 (range 33-66 Gy, EQD2(10) = 70.5) Gy and 48 (range 27-66 Gy, EQD2(10) = 71) Gy for the re-SBRT. The median mean liver dose (D(mean, liver)) was 6 Gy (range 1-25, EQD2(2) = 7 Gy) for the first SBRT and 10 Gy (range 1-63 Gy, EQD2(2) = 9 Gy) for the re-SBRT. Of the 30 re-irradiated lesions 6 were re-irradiated in-field resulting in a median EQD2(2, maximum) of 359 (range 120-500) Gy for both treatments, with an α/β = 2 to account for liver parenchyma. Treatment was well tolerated. Two patients with stent placement before SBRT developed cholangitis 4 and 14 months after re-SBRT. There were no elevations of the serum liver parameters after re-SBRT. One patient developed a grade 3 gastrointestinal bleeding. There was no radiation induced liver disease (RILD) observed.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients treated for HCC between 2012 and 2016 were reviewed. Among these, 668 patients who underwent RFA of 736 tumors and 105 patients who underwent SBRT of 114 tumors were included. Using propensity score matching (PSM) to adjust for clinical factors, 95 tumors were selected from each treatment arm. Freedom from local progression (the primary endpoint, FFLP) was compared before and after adjustment with PSM. RESULTS: At baseline, SBRT-treated tumors were more advanced, larger (median, 2.4 vs. 1.6 cm), and more frequently located in the subphrenic region than RFA-treated tumors (P < .001). The median follow-up was 21.5 (interquartile range, 11.2-36.7) months. Before PSM, the 2-year FFLP rates were 76.3% for the SBRT group and 70.2% for the RFA groups, respectively. After PSM, the 2-year FFLP rates were 74.9% for the SBRT group and 64.9% for the RFA group, respectively. The local control rates were not significantly different. The Cox proportional hazards model revealed the treatment modality as an independent predictor of local recurrence favoring SBRT in the entire cohort and in the PSM model. Elevated tumor markers, tumor location (subphrenic region), and tumor size (>2.0 cm) were also independent predictors of local progression.

Compared with randomized clinical trials (RCTs), these studies are prone to confounding by indication and selection biases that may threaten the validity despite efforts to account for them. A recent NCDB study that utilized propensity score (PS) methods suggested radiofrequency ablation (RFA) may yield better survival than SBRT for patients (pts) with non-surgically managed localized HCC. Significant concerns about selection biases of pts referred for SBRT and their impact on the study findings remain. Our objective is to investigate the impacts of selection biases that cannot be readily accounted for by conventional PS methods. Materials/Methods: We consider an unbiased comparison between SBRT and RFA can be obtained from a ""super-population"" (e.g., P1), consisting of candidate pts had a RCT of SBRT vs. RFA were conducted hypothetically. Conventional PS analyses use a subset of this ""super-population"" (e.g., P2) who were eventually referred for SBRT and RFA to obtain an unconfounded treatment comparison. When P2 is biasedly selected from P1, naive PS analyses based on P2 alone cannot fully recover the underlying treatment difference due to selection biases. We used so-called Inverse Probability of Selection Weighting (IPSW) method to account for selection biases that cannot be addressed by PS. IPSW-based Kaplan-Meier method and Cox model were used to report and compare Overall survival (OS), defined as the interval btw treatment and death or last follow-up (f/u). Result(s): The super-population (P1) consists of 6,041 cases diagnosed with primary HCC in 2004 to 2014, including 499 (8.3%) and 5,542 (91.7%) who received SBRT and RFA, respectively. The selected sample (P2) for naive PS analysis consists of 3,513 cases (7.6% SBRT vs. 92.4% RFA) w/ median f/u 3.8 yrs. Potential selection biases were observed. Without accounting for selection biases, hazard ratio (HR) for OS (SBRT vs. RFA) using naive PS analysis is 1.46 (95% CI: 1.08-1.97, p=0.01). Using the proposed IPSW method, the HR was reduced to 1.10 (95% CI: 0.79-1.52, p=0.57). The estimated OS rates at 1, 3, and 5 year (yr) w/o and w/ accounting for selection biases are summarized in the Table. Conclusion(s): Our study suggests selection biases may exist and substantially impact findings when naive PS analysis are performed. Additional residual confounding may still remain due to incomplete key prognostic factors. Analyses based on observational database for comparative effectiveness research requires extra cautions to minimize the impacts of confounders and selection biases.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The subjects of this retrospective report are 38 patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent SBRT per institutional phase 1 to 2 eligibility criteria, before definitive OLT. Pre-OLT radiographs were compared with pathologic gold standard. Analysis of treatment failures and deaths was undertaken. RESULTS: With median follow-up of 4.8 years from OLT, 9 of 38 patients (24%) recurred, whereas 10 of 38 patients (26%) died. Kaplan-Meier estimates of 3-year overall survival and disease-free survival are 77% and 74%, respectively. Sum longest dimension of tumors was significantly associated with disease-free survival (hazard ratio 1.93, P=.026). Pathologic response rate (complete plus partial response) was 68%. Radiographic scoring criteria performed poorly; modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors produced highest concordance (κ = 0.224). Explants revealed viable tumor in 74% of evaluable patients. Treatment failures had statistically larger sum longest dimension of tumors (4.0 cm vs 2.8 cm, P=.014) and non-statistically significant higher rates of lymphovascular space invasion (44% vs 17%), cT2 disease (44% vs 21%), ≥pT2 disease (67% vs 34%), multifocal tumors at time of SBRT (44% vs 21%), and less robust mean α-fetoprotein response (-25 IU/mL vs -162 IU/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic body radiation therapy before to OLT is a well-tolerated treatment providing 68% pathologic response, though 74% of explants ultimately contained viable tumor.

Renal cell carcinoma is the most common kidney cancer and it can metastasize. Our aim was to analyze patients treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy of renal cell carcinoma metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 58 patients (73 lesions) were treated from 2004 to 2016. Patients were candidates for analysis if a maximum of 3 metastases were diagnosed and the primary tumor was resected. Toxicity was classified according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3. RESULTS: All patients had renal cell carcinoma, in particular the clear cell type in 82.7%. A total of 39 metastases (53.4%) were located in the lungs and 19 (26%) were in the lymph nodes. Less common were metastases to bone (9.5% of cases), the liver (4.1%) and the adrenal gland (6.8%). Median followup was 16.1 months (range 3.5 to 157.1). The local control rate at 12 and 18 months was 90.2% and 90.2%, respectively. The progression-free survival rate at 12 and 18 months was 46.2% (95% CI 32.2-59) and 35% (95% CI 21.4-48.9), respectively. On univariate and multivariable analyses metachronous and single metastases predicted better progression-free survival. Systemic therapy before stereotactic body radiation therapy predicted improved local control in clear cell cases.

Local treatments for oligometastatic patients may have significant role since a large majority of patients treated with systemic chemotherapy experience progression mostly in initial sites of tumor burden rather than new sites of progression. Surgical excision of metastatic sites usually from liver and lung that have been shown to prolong survival in colorectal cancer, sarcomas, melanoma, breast cancer and many other tumor types. Currently surgery is considered to be standard approach for these groups of patients. Surgical series of hepatic metastasectomy of primary colorectal cancer resulted 18-51 % 5-year survival rate with 2-7% operative mortality and 6-13 % serious morbidity risk. Most of the metastasectomy data are based on single institutional series and had many confounding factors such as patient selection that cause some doubts about the results. It should also be considered that many tumors are inoperable due to tumor location or medical inoperability of the patient. Stereotactic treatment was developed by a neurosurgeon Lars Leksell to treat inoperable deeply seated lesions in the brain. SABR recently become popular to extra-cranial sites with technological improvements. Its strengths include high rates of tumor eradication via non-invasive, convenient, short outpatient treatment course, favorable toxicity and no recovery time. It yielded very good results for treatment of primary and metastatic tumors in various body sites in properly selected patients. However despite potential advantages, there are few published retrospective or phase II studies with limited patient number. These studies about metastatic liver disease that have been treated with SABR yielded 70-82 % 2-year local control rate without any serious toxicity. So there is great hope that SABR may find prominent place in treatment of metastatic cancer. There are also few literature data with favorable results on lung, adrenal, lymph node metastasis treated with SABR. There is no randomized study comparing efficacy and toxicity of surgery and SABR in oligometastatic setting. Many authors consider surgery as the standard treatment for local management of metastatic sites. However, SABR is promising approach as a complementary or alternative regimen to surgery. Until well-designed randomized studies comparing these two regimens, selection of treatment should be individualized to the patient with the guidance of available data. Individualization of treatment is dependent on patient factors and metastatic sites. Performance status, comorbidities of the patient, location and number of metastatic sites, previous treatments, underlying prognosis, tumor biology and experience of the team are all important factors for consideration of local treatment.",exclusion,,,,,,,

Murine studies have previously demonstrated that treatment with the late-autophagy inhibitor chloroquine in combination with chemotherapy limited tumor growth. Method(s): In this phase 1/2 trial, we examined treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and gemcitabine for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, evaluated by Storer's dose escalation design. Secondary endpoints were CA 19-9 biomarker response, R0 resection rates, survival, and correlative studies of autophagy. Result(s): Thirty-five patients were enrolled. There were no dose-limiting toxicities and no grade 4/5 events related to treatment. Nineteen patients (61 %) had a decrease in CA 19-9 after treatment. Twenty-nine patients (94 %) underwent surgical resection as scheduled, with a 77 % R0 resection rate. Median overall survival was 34.8 months (95 % confidence interval, 11.57 to not reached).

Of all 146 patients, 45 (31%) had a CP score elevation of ≥2 within 6 months of radiation therapy (RT) (27 patients [28%] with baseline CP-A/B7 and 18 [35%] with baseline CP-B8/B9/C cirrhosis; P = .45). On multivariate analysis, neither baseline CP nor ALBI score was predictive of toxicity. No patient with a decline in liver functionality of CP ≥2 within 6 months of RT returned to baseline at later time points. Eleven grade 4 toxicities were observed. The mean change in the raw ALBI score at ∼6 months was similar for all baseline ALBI groups. Twenty-two patients underwent orthotopic liver transplantation after RT, 13 of whom had baseline CP-B8/B9/C liver functionality. For all patients, the 1- and 2-year treated-lesion local control was greater for SBRT than for AHRT (2-year 94% vs 65%, P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: The tolerability of SBRT or AHRT as measured by a CP score decline of ≥2 within 6 months of RT was similar across baseline liver functionality groups. Compared with AHRT, SBRT was associated with superior local control. Because the true tolerability of limited-volume RT for patients with CP-B or CP-C cirrhosis is unknown, prospective trials validating its safety and efficacy are warranted.",inclusion,,AHRT as comparator?,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.11.030,,,,

Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 151 patients with HCC treated with SBRT (50 Gy in 5 fractions) or AHRT (45 Gy in 18 fractions) between 2007 and 2015. Primary endpoint was incidence of grade 3 or higher toxicities within 6 months of radiotherapy (RT). Patients were censored for toxicity upon local progression, further liver-directed therapy, or if they exhibited grade 3 or higher toxicities prior to RT, unless RT elevated the grading or a new toxicity class was observed. Secondary endpoints of overall survival and local control were calculated. Result(s): Median follow-up was 11 months (1 - 90 months). Most received SBRT (72%), while 28% received AHRT due to size criteria ( > 5 cm) or proximity to a critical organ-at-risk. Grade 3 or higher hyperbilirubinemia and hypoalbuminemia was greater in the CP-B8/B9/C patients (42% and 22%) or ALBI-3 patients (45% and 31%) compared to patients with CP-A/B7 (11% and 4%, p < 0.001) or ALBI-1/2 (14% and 4%, p < 0.001). For all other toxicity classes, no difference between liver functionality groups was seen. Eleven grade 4 and no grade 5 toxicities were observed. For all pts, 1- and 2-year treated-lesion local control (LC) rates were greater for SBRT as compared to AHRT (2-year LC 95% vs. 66%, p < 0.0001). When excluding patients with planning treatment volumes > 115 cc (equivalent to a 6 cm sphere), SBRT still yielded superior outcomes. Conclusion(s): Other than higher rates of grade 3+ hypoalbuminemia and hyperbilirubinemia, highly conformal RT appears to be a potentially safe and effective treatment option for HCC patients with advanced liver dysfunction.

Although surgery is the only treatment with proven efficacy for IVC-TT, the surgical management of advanced IVCTT is difficult and offers poor survival outcomes. Furthermore, about 50% of these patients develop recurrent metastatic disease within a year. Stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SAbR) was shown to be effective for RCC with favorable response rates reported for SAbR when directed at portal or IVC-TT in the setting of hepatocellular carcinoma. We report the results from the safety lead-in phase of an ongoing phase II trial designed to evaluate the effect of neo-adjuvant SAbR for IVC-TT on the 1-year recurrence-free survival of RCC patients. METHOD(S): Newly diagnosed Patients with RCC and IVC-TT received 40Gy in 5 fractions of neo-adjuvant SAbR to the IVC-TT, followed by radical nephrectomy and thrombectomy. Primary endpoints for the safety lead-in phase were feasibility and safety defined as absence of grade 4-5 adverse events within 90 days of surgery. RESULT(S): The characteristics of the 6 IVC-TT patients enrolled in this trial and relative tumors with Novick level II-III IVCTT are summarized in table 1. One additional patient was withdrawn from the trial because of extensive liver metastasis found during surgery which was subsequently aborted. SAbR was administered over 9-16 days, seven immediate adverse events (grade 1-2) were reported in 4 patients during or after SAbR. Surgery was performed within 4-14 days from the completion of SAbR. The estimated blood loss range was 10-1200cc and 3 patients received blood transfusions. No intraoperative complications were reported. Length of hospital stay after surgery was 3-10 days. No readmissions or mortality related to surgery were observed. Overall, 56 post-operative adverse events were reported within 90 days (table 1), none of which were greater than grade 3; of those, 23 (41%) and 7 (12%) were considered to be related to surgery or SAbR, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Our initial results indicate that neo-adjuvant SAbR followed by nephrectomy and tumor thrombectomy for IVC-TT is feasible and safe. The ongoing phase II trial will evaluate the effect of neo-adjuvant SAbR on survival and metastatic recurrence for RCC patients with IVC-TT.",exclusion,,,,,,,

In this study we aim to assess the efficacy of SBRT in comparison to sorafenib treatment in patients with advanced HCC. Material(s) and Method(s): We included 901 patients treated with sorafenib at six tertiary centers in Europe and Asia and 122 patients treated with SBRT from thirteen centers in Germany and Switzerland. Medical records were reviewed including laboratory parameters and treatment characteristics. Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Result(s): Median OS of SBRT patients was 18.1 [10.3 - 25.9] months compared to 8.8 [8.2 - 9.5] months in patients treated with sorafenib. After adjusting for different baseline characteristics, the survival benefit for patients treated with SBRT was still preserved with a median OS of 17.0 [10.8 - 23.2] months compared to 9.6 [8.6 - 10.7] months in patients treated with sorafenib. SBRT of intrahepatic lesions in patients with extrahepatic metastases was also associated with improved OS compared to patients treated with sorafenib in the same setting (17.0 vs 10.0 months, p=0.012) whereas in patients with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) there was no survival benefit in patients with SBRT.

The term oligometastasis describes an intermediate state of cancer spread between localized disease and widespread metastasis. The implication of such an intermediate state is that the disease can be cured by using metastasis‐directed therapy. Historically, in some patients with oligometastases in the liver or lungs, surgical resection was often indicated, as abundant evidence suggested it could improve progression‐free or overall survival. Recently, several studies have reported promising outcomes of >80% local control with Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) in patients with lung or liver oligometastases. Nonetheless, very few studies have focused on non‐liver, non‐lung extracranial oligometastatic lesions treated with SBRT, and such studies have limitations of a retrospective nature and small sample sizes.Because allmost studies are based on single‐arm studies without appropriate controls, the level of evidence to support SBRT is weak. Randomized trials are therefore necessary to establish the utility of SBRT for oligometastatic disease. This study is designed as a randomized phase II study. Patients will be randomized between current standard treatment (Arm 1) versus standard treatment +SBRT (Arm 2) to all known disease.",inclusion,,,We should check in more detail about the tumors that are studied,,,,

METHODS: We retrospectively identified transplant-ineligible HCC patients treated with SBRT to the liver between 2004 and 2013. Our primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). We also report treatment toxicities using CTCAE 3.0, radiographic response, and patterns of failure. RESULTS: We identified 93 patients with median age at SBRT of 65.8 years. Forty-six percent were classified as Child-Pugh B or C and 85% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1-2. After SBRT, 86% of patients experienced no or mild treatment-related adverse events. Only 8% of patients experienced grade 3 and 2% of patients experienced grade 4 adverse events. Overall radiographic response was complete in 1.2%, partial in 35.4%, stable in 43.9%, and progressive disease in 19.5%. Median OS was 8.8 months with 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates of 38.0, 29.8 and 21.2%, respectively. The Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score was found to strongly correlate with survival. Median OS for patients with CLIP scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 was 21.1, 8.5, 5.1, and 7.1 months, respectively (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Our series demonstrates that SBRT is generally safe for HCC patients, even those with advanced liver failure.

random-journal.pdf,LivP182,"M., Bignardi",2016,English,LIV.M:#5;LIV.P:#1,SBRT for liver metastases from low grade neuroendocrine tumors,"Purpose or Objective: Specific results of SBRT for liver metastases from rare tumors have been reported scarcely. This applies also to metastases from low grade neuroendocrine tumors (NET), either derived from gastrointestinal organs or from an unknown primary site. Here we report two cases of multiple liver metastases from low grade NET repeatedly treated by means of SBRT, achieving the outcome of long-term local control. Material(s) and Method(s): From March 2011 to September 2015 49 SBRT courses were delivered to 39 patients for liver metastases from different primaries. All courses were given by VMAT with 6 MV photons, image guided by CBCT in every fraction. Since 2013, deep inspiration breath hold was adopted in order to control organ motion. Two patient had metastases from well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors, one from an unknown primary (patient A), the other from a pancreatic primary (patient B). Patient A underwent two SBRT courses, both in 2011, the first one on segment 6 (CTV volume 25 ml, CTV dose 75 Gy, PTV 50 Gy, in 3 fractions), the second one on two adjacent metastases, respectively in segment 7 and 8 (total CTV volume 54 ml, CTV dose 60 Gy, PTV 50 Gy, in 3 fractions). Patient B received three courses, respectively in 2013, 2014 and 2015. The first SBRT was delivered on segment 6 (CTV volume 38 ml, CTV dose 50 Gy, PTvV45 Gy, in 5 fractions), the second on segment 8 (CTV volume 30 ml, CTV dose 50 Gy, PTV 45 Gy, in 5 fractions), the last on segment 4 (CTV volume 44 ml, CTV dose 50 Gy, PTV 45 Gy, in 5 fractions ). Patient A was found to be somatostatine receptor-negative, thus he was followed up mainly by serial CT scans; also, his disease status matched well to trends of two biomarkers (chromogranin A and gastrin). Patient B was followed up by alternating CT scans and PET/CT-68Ga-DOTATOC. Result(s): At last follow up patient A achieved long-term local control in S6 metastasis (45 months) as well as in S7-8 (42 months), while showing disease progression at a new liver site at 45 months after first SBRT. At last follow up patient B achieved local control in all sites (S6: 30 months; S8: 13 months; S4: 6 months) with a durable partial PET response in S8 and S4 and a complete PET response in S6. Disease progression took place in two bone sites at 30 months after first SBRT, without any concomitant liver progression. Conclusion(s): these favorable results in large volume liver metastases from low grade NET, although derived from only two anedoctal cases, give support to the concept that the outcome of SBRT is relatively independent from tumor type, being mainly mediated by an ablative effect. Also they represent a typical example showing how repeat liver SBRT may lead to a a significant delay in disease progression although without achieving a definitive cure.",exclusion,,,,,,,
random-journal.pdf,LivP183,"Kimura, T",2017,English,LIV.M:#5;LIV.P:#1,SBRT for oligometastases,"Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is commonly used to treat patients with extracranial oligometastases in clinical settings. In addition, the ""abscopal effect"", which is radiotherapy-induced immune-mediated tumor regression at sites distant to the irradiated field, and treatment with a combination of SBRT and immune checkpoint inhibitors have attracted attentions of researchers. According to an international survey of more than 1000 radiation oncologists reported by Lewis SL et al.[1], 61% of responders have been using SBRT for extracranial oligometastases, and the most commonly treated organs were the lung (90%), liver (75%) and spine (70%). Many authors have suggested that surgery for extracranial oligometastases might improve local control and overall survival. With the recent technical developments in SBRT, SBRT is also a promising modality for achieving a high rate of local control with minimal invasiveness. In this lecture, we would like to review the treatment results of SBRT for extracranial oligometastases, such as those located in the lung, liver and spine and discuss comparisons between surgery and SBRT, and cost-effectiveness. 1) SBRT for extracranial oligometastases, such as those located in the lung, liver and spine. 1. Lung Colorectal cancer (CRC) often presents with oligometastases, commonly in the lung and liver, and CRC has a high risk of local failure [2]. The accepted selection criteria include a good performance status (PS), absence of extra-pulmonary disease, control of the primary tumor, 1-5 synchronous or metachronous metastases and adequate respiratory function [3, 4]. Several authors have reported that the 2-year local control rate ranges 49- 96%. The optimal dose is recommended at least 48 Gy in three fractions to achieve greater than 90% 2-year control. 2. Liver The best candidates are patients with a good PS, controlled or absent extra-hepatic disease, <=3 hepatic lesions, size lesions <=3 cm, lesion distance from organs at risk >8 mm, good liver function (Childs A) and a healthy liver [5]. Several authors have reported that the 2-year local control rate ranged from 79- 92%. The optimal dose is recommended 48- 60 Gy in three fractions for lesions with a diameter <=3 cm, while for lesions with a diameter >3 cm a higher prescription dose, such as 60- 75 Gy is necessary to obtain similar local control [5]. 3. Spine The goal of spinal SBRT is local control and pain control. Several authors have reported that the 1-year local control rate ranges 80- 98% and provides pain relief. Therefore, several dose/fractionation schedules, such as 24 Gy in 1 fraction or 27 or 30 Gy in 3 fractions have been used and the optimal dose/fraction schedule is still unclear. 2) Comparison between surgery and SBRT for extracranial oligometastases According to several guidelines, surgery for extracranial oligometastases is still standard practice because of lack of evidence that SBRT has clinical advantages. A retrospective analysis comparing surgery with SBRT for 110 patients with pulmonary oligometastases demonstrated that 3-years overall survival rates were 62% for surgery and 60% for SBRT (p = 0.43) [6]. The authors concluded survival after surgery was not better than after SBRT although SBRT should be the second choice after surgery. However, no randomized trials have been conducted, and prospective randomized studies are required to define the effectiveness of each modality. 3) Cost-effectiveness Extracranial oligometastases have been usually managed with systemic therapy with or without surgery. However, systemic therapy, including molecular targeted drugs, is expensive. A cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov modelling approach demonstrated that video-assisted thoracic surgery wedge resection or SBRT could be costeffective in selected patients with pulmonary oligometastases [7]. Increases in medical expenses are a social problem worldwide, but it can be said that SBRT is a promising modality in this aspect.",exclusion,Review,Interesting as a review,,,,,

We evaluated safety and efficacy of SBRT for primary liver cancer in a patterns-of-care and patterns-of-outcome analysis. Material and Methods The working group ""Stereotactic Radiotherapy"" of the German Society for Radiation Oncology performed a retrospective multicenter analysis of SBRT for hepatocellular and cholangiocellular carcinoma (HCC and CCC). Eleven centers with experience in pulmonary SBRT participated. SBRT for this indication was introduced in 1999 and data were entered into a centralized database. The analysis comprised 206 lesions in 174 patients after retrieval of patient, tumor and treatment data from the aforementioned multi-center database. HCC and CCC were analyzed separately and pooled. Available factors were analysed for local control (LC), overall survival (OS) and toxicity. Results The range of lesions per center was 1-100 with a median of 13 patients per center. In 174 patients 206 lesions were treated, 134 (65%) HCC and 72 CCC lesions. Karnofsky Performance Status was 80-100 in 88% and 60-70 in 12%. Child-Turcotte-Pugh stage in HCC was A, B and C in 62%, 29% and 6%. Largest tumor diameter was median 5 cm (SD 3.9) with 144 patients having a single target lesion, 26 with 2, 3 with 3 and 1 with 4 lesions. PTV volume was median 127 cc (5 - 3553). Median BED10 prescribed to the PTV margin was 72 Gy (range 36 - 180 Gy): SBRT was delivered in a median of 5 fractions (3-17) to a median PTV prescription dose of 45 Gy (30 - 68 Gy ). Median follow-up of patients alive was 12 months. Local control was 89%, 87% and 83% at 12, 18 and 24 months with no significant difference between HCC and CCC. Two-year LC was 81% vs. 91% (p = .075) for doses < 72Gy BED vs >= 72 Gy BED, respectively. Median OS was 16.7 months, 17.5 months and 14.6 months for HCC vs CCC (p=n.s.). Gastroduodenitis was grade 2 or 3 in 2% and 1%, respectively. Data on other toxicity was only available in 41% and was >= grade 2 in 4%: this was esophageal variceal bleeding grade 2 in 3 patients and deteriorated liver function in 3 patients. Conclusion This is to our knowledge the largest series on SBRT in primary liver cancer reported. Local control is good in this cohort for both HCC and CCC with a moderate median BED, and median overall survival is well in the range of other series of SBRT in these entities. Prospective trials should be conducted to further validate the role of SBRT in primary liver tumors.",exclusion,No comparator,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with adrenal metastases treated using SBRT from 2001 to 2014. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1 was used. Maximum tumor response was defined as the greatest percentage tumor reduction noted on two or more post-SBRT CT scans. RESULTS: We identified 44 patients (median age 61.3 years, range: 25.8-85), with 54 adrenal metastases; primary diagnoses include non-small cell lung cancer (28 patients and 38 lesions), small cell lung cancer (1 patient), hepatocellular carcinoma (6 patients), and other (9 patients). Treatment was delivered in single (16 lesions, median dose 18 Gy [14-18]) or multiple fractions (38 lesions, median dose 30 Gy [16-40]). Median planning target volume was 49.65cc (3.21-984.54). Median response at first post-SBRT follow-up (median 1.65 months (m) (0.33-5.37), n = 46 lesions) was 10.8% with 91.3% local control. Median maximum tumor response was 31.8% (n = 32 lesions) at median follow-up of 5.4 m (0.9-44.8) with 96.6% local control. The response was comparable regardless of tumor histology or treatment fractionation. No patients experienced Grade 3/4 acute toxicities. One patient with a history of naproxen use required suturing with omental patch placement for perforated pyloric ulcer 14 m post-SBRT (18 Gy in single fraction) to the right adrenal metastasis; this region received <5 Gy.

The incidence varies between 20 and 85% depending on the primary cancer. Breast, prostate, and lung cancers are responsible for 70% of bone metastases. Cancer with bone metastases compared to other metastatic sites is considered as associated with a better prognosis, particularly for breast and prostate cancer. Bone metastases may be present at diagnosis (synchronous metastasis) or appear at a later time (metachronous metastasis). The concept of ""oligometastases"" was proposed in patients with about 3 up to 5 metastases (without restriction on the primary site) and associated with an intermediate prognosis. It was hypothesized that local treatment with curative intent, aiming at the few metastatic sites, would yield long‐term survival probabilities, along with systemic therapies. Long‐term survivors have been reported after curative‐intent treatment of metastasis in sarcoma and colorectal cancers with liver or lung metastasis. We chose to focus on bone metastasis because of their high incidence, their impact on the patient's quality of life and autonomy, and their accessibility to potentially curative radiotherapy. The systemic treatment of metastatic cancer includes hormonal therapy (breast and prostate cancer), biologically‐targeted drugs and chemotherapy (all cancers). Stereotactic radiotherapy is a highly accurate technique was initially developed for performing the radiosurgery of brain tumors in patients for whom it was deemed be too difficult to proceed to classical excision surgery. In this process, a high total dose of radiation is delivered in a single fraction to a well‐defined intra‐cranial target. The concept of radiotherapy in stereotactic conditions was extended to one or several fractions delivered to small volumes primary tumors/ metastases in extra‐cranial sites (Stereotactic Body RadioTherapy [SBRT]). At present, high control rates have been achieved for lung metastases. Similarly, very high local control rates have been reported in bone metastases after stereotactic radiotherapy. In this protocol, our purpose is to demonstrate, via a randomized phase III trial, that high doses of radiotherapy, delivered in stereotactic conditions to the bone metastases (between 1 and 3 metastases) in solid tumor patients is able to improve the survival without progression.",exclusion,,,,,,,

Methods: Eligible patients had a controlled primary malignancy with 1‐5 metastatic lesions, all of which were suitable for SABR, had an ECOG performance status 0‐1, and life expectancy >6 months. Stratification was by number of metastases (1‐3 vs. 4‐5). Randomization was in a 1:2 ratio between palliative standard of care (SOC) [Arm 1] vs. SOC plus SABR to all metastatic lesions [Arm 2]. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). A randomized phase II screening design was employed with a two‐sided alpha of 0.20 (wherein a p‐value <0.20 designates a positive trial) to provide an initial comparison of the two treatment strategies. Secondary endpoints included progression‐free survival (PFS), toxicity, and QOL (assessed using the FACT‐G).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included all early stage HCC patients who were not candidates for primary resection and/or local therapy, treated with SBRT between 11/2011 and 1/2016. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were included. The median age was 62 years; 70% males; 30% females; 70% viral hepatitis carriers; 100% cirrhotic; 13 Child Pugh [CP]-A and 10 [CP]-B. The median tumor volume was 12.7cm(3) (range, 2.2-53.6 cm(3)). Treatment was well tolerated. With the exception of one patient who developed RILD, no other patient had significant changes in 12 weeks of laboratory follow-up. SBRT was a bridge to transplantation in 16 patients and 11 were transplanted.. No surgical difficulties or complications were reported following SBRT, and none of the transplanted patients had local progression before transplantation. The median prescribed dose to the tumor was 54Gy (range, 30-54Gy), the median dose to the uninvolved liver was 6.0Gy(range, 1.6-12.6Gy). With a median follow-up time of 12 months, the median overall-survival for the 11 transplanted patients was not reached (range, 2.0-53.7+ months) and was 23 months for the 12 non-transplanted patients. The median progression-free survival for the transplanted patients was not reached (54+ months) and was 14.0 months for the non-transplanted patients. There was no SBRT-related mortality. Liver explant post SBRT revealed pathological complete response in 3(27.3%), pathological partial response in 6(54.5%), and pathological stable disease in 2(18.2%) tumors. CONCLUSIONS: SBRT is safe and effective and can be used as a bridge to transplantation without comprising the surgical procedure.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.1186/s13014-017-0899-4,,,,

Method(s): Eighteen patients with different primary tumors: Colorectal carcinoma (9 patients), lung carcinoma and breast cancer (3 patients each) and 1 to 2 metastatic liver lesions were treated with the CyberKnife system from 2012 to mid 2015 after CT-guided implantation of 2-4 fiducial gold markers. Prescribed total dose was 45Gy (65% prescription isodose) in 3 fractions given every other day. Clinical target volume (CTV) was defined as visible gross tumor on co-registered MRI and iv-contrast-CT scans. Fiducial tracking was used for reducing planning target volume (PTV) to 4 mm added to the CTV. Ray tracing dose calculation algorithm was applied. For lesions near the diaphragm an additional MC-calculation was done to verify dose distribution. Concurrent chemotherapy was allowed. Follow up was done by CT or MRI in three monthly intervals. Result(s): 18 patients (10 females, 8 males; median age 61 years) were treated; median follow up time for surviving patients was 22.9 months. Median PTV volume was 59 cc. Local control rate after 1 year was 78.2% (+/-11.4%) and 55.9% after 2 years (+/-15.6%). One and two-year overall survival probability was 64.7% (+/-11.6%) and 43.6% (+/-13.6%), respectively. Almost all patients showed metastatic progression in non treated sites (liver inclusive), median time to metastatic progression was 5.3 months. Acute toxicity was mild, one patient experienced grade 1 gastroduodenitis, and two patients had postinterventional bleeding after gold marker insertion (seen on CT/MRI). Conclusion(s): Robotic SBRT of liver metastases is an effective method with good local control and excellent tolerability for oligometastatic patients.

METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 55 patients (70 lesions) with a median follow-up of 10 months (range 1-57) treated from 2011 to 2016. All patients had not been eligible for other local treatment options. Median age was 64 years and 64% were male. 27 patients (36 lesions) suffered from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, Child A:78%, Child B:18%, Child C:4%), 28 patients (34 lesions) had oligometastatic liver disease (MD). Treatment planning was based on 4D-CT usually after placement of fiducials. Dose and fractionation varied depending on localization and size, most commonly 3 × 12.5 Gy (prescribed to the surrounding 65%-isodose) in 56% and 5x8Gy (80% isodose) in 20% of the treated lesions. RESULTS: Local recurrence was observed in 7 patients (13%) and 8 lesions (11%), resulting in estimated 1- and 2-year local control rates (LC) of 91 and 74%. Estimated 1- and 2-year rates of Freedom from hepatic failure (FFHF) were 42 and 28%. Number of lesions was predictive for LC and FFHF in the entire cohort. Estimated 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS) was 76 and 57%. OS was significantly affected by number of treated lesions and performance status. In the HCC subgroup, pretreatment liver function and gender were also predictive for OS. Maximum acute non-hepatic toxicity was grade 1 in 16% and grade 2 in 10% of the patients. Three HCC patients (11%) developed marked deterioration of liver function (grade 3/4). CONCLUSIONS: SBRT resulted in high local control and acceptable survival rates in patients with HCC or MD not amendable to other locally-ablative treatment options with limited toxicity.

In this study, we aim to assess the efficacy and safety of SBRT in comparison to sorafenib treatment in patients with advanced HCC. METHODS: We included 901 patients treated with sorafenib at six tertiary centers in Europe and Asia and 122 patients treated with SBRT from 13 centers in Germany and Switzerland. Medical records were reviewed including laboratory parameters, treatment characteristics and development of adverse events. Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival. RESULTS: Median OS of SBRT patients was 18.1 (10.3-25.9) months compared to 8.8 (8.2-9.5) in sorafenib patients. After adjusting for different baseline characteristics, the survival benefit for patients treated with SBRT was still preserved with a median OS of 17.0 (10.8-23.2) months compared to 9.6 (8.6-10.7) months in sorafenib patients. SBRT treatment of intrahepatic lesions in patients with extrahepatic metastases was also associated with improved OS compared to patients treated with sorafenib in the same setting (17.0 vs. 10.0 months, p = 0.012), whereas in patients with portal vein thrombosis there was no survival benefit in patients with SBRT.

METHODS: Fifty-three patients with CL-HCC were treated with SBRT from 2011 to 2017 in our institution. CL-HCC was defined as a tumor sited in segments 4, 5, or 8 adjacent to the hepatic hilum, or < 1.5 cm from main portal branches. Primary endpoints were treatment response, local control (LC), and hepatobiliary toxicity (HBT). RESULTS: Thirty-three (62.3%) patients had Child-Turcotte-Pugh score A, 20 (37.77%)-score B. Albumin-bilirubin grade 1 constituted 6 (11.3%) cases, grade 2-32 (60.4%), grade 3-15 (28.3%). Median tumor diameter was 34 mm. Median BED10 was 72 Gy. Complete/partial response was observed in 40 (75.5%) lesions, stable disease-in 9 (17.0%). At a median follow-up of 12.2 months, there were 6 (11.3%) local failures. The actuarial 2-year LC rate was 87.9%. 2-year LC was better with higher BED10 (> 70 vs ≤ 70 Gy) 96.9 vs 72.5%, p = 0.01.

SBRT for CRC liver metastasis has not been well established. We report mature outcome of sequential prospective phase I/II studies of SBRT for CRC liver metastasis. Materials/Methods: Patients with metastatic CRC to liver, unsuitable for surgery, treated on either a phase I study of 6 fraction SBRT (for liver metastases from any primary cancer) or a phase II study of 6 fraction SBRT for CRC liver metastases were pooled for evaluation. Eligibility criteria included ECOG performance status (PS) - 2, tumor - 15cm, life expectancy > 3 months -700ml uninvolved liver and, for phase II - 5 metastases. GTV was contoured on IV contrast CT and expanded isotropically within liver by 5mm to CTV; PTVexpansion was determined by individual respiratory motion, using ABC breath hold or abdominal compression if amplitude of breathing motion was > 5 mm. SBRT was delivered in six fractions on alternate days with individualized dose based on the effective volume of liver irradiated. Result(s): From August 2003 until September 2012, 60 CRC patients were treated (39 on phase I, 21 on phase II). Table 1 shows patient characteristics. Median time from diagnosis to SBRT was 30 months. All patients completed SBRT as prescribed. Of 60 patients, 57 were followed until death or continue to be seen, while 3 were lost to follow up, all having progressive disease at last review at 5.0, 6.6 and 34.1 months. All patients were imaged at least once post treatment; median time from treatment to final imaging was 12.6 months (0.4-96.2). At time of last imaging, 42% had progressed in-field, 28% SD, 23% PR and 7% CR. Median time to infield progression was 6.9 months. Median survival following SBRT was 14.9 months. Two patients remain alive 49 and 125 months post SBRT respectively without evidence of active disease or subsequent therapy. On univariate analysis, GTVsum volume, hemoglobin, prescribed dose and extra hepatic disease were predictive for survival (all P < 0.05). On multivariate analysis of these factors, prescribed dose (P = 0.001) and extra hepatic disease (P = 0.006) remained predictive. For LC, only prescribed dose was predictive on UVA (P = 0.004). Survival for the 16 patients without extra-hepatic disease prescribed > mean dose (41.6 Gy) was 25 months vs 12.6 months for the remainder. (Table presented) Conclusion(s): In this prospective study, SBRT is shown to be effective for LC of CRC liver metastases in the majority of patients, even in those with larger GTVs. Dose prescribed was highly predictive for LC and OS, providing a rationale for dose escalation.

METHODS: Inclusion criteria of the present retrospective study were: (a) liver oligometastases with controlled primary tumor; (b) absence of progressive disease ≥6 months; (c) metastases ≤ 3; (d) evaluation of SBRT-response by means of 18-fludeoxyglucose-PET/CT for at least two subsequent evaluations; (e) Karnofsky performance status >80; (f) life-expectancy >6 months. The following metabolic parameters were defined semi-quantitatively for each metastases: (1) standardized uptake value (SUVmax; (2) SUV-mean; (3) metabolic tumor volume (MTV), tumor volume with a SUV ≥3, threshold 40%; (4) total lesion glycolysis (TLG), i.e. the product of SUV-mean and MTV. Local control was defined as absence of recurrence in the field of irradiation. RESULTS: 41 liver metastases were analyzed. Pre-SBRT, median SUV-max was 8.7 (range, 4.5-23.59), median SUV-mean was 4.6 (range, 3-7.5), median MTV was 5.7 cc (range, 0.9-80.6) and median total lesion glycolysis was 24.1 (range, 3.6-601.5). At statistical analysis, metastases with SUV-mean >5 (p 0.04; odds ratio 4.75, sensitivity = 50%, specificity = 82.6%, area under the curve 0.66) and SUV-max >12 (p 0.02; odds ratio 5.03, sensitivity = 69%, specificity = 70%, area under the curve = 0.69) showed higher rates of infield-failure compared to the remaining lesions. CONCLUSION: According to current findings, pre-SBRT SUV-max and SUV-mean could be predictable of local response in liver oligometastases. Advances in knowledge: Present findings could support the hypothesis that fludeoxyglucose-PET/CT may be a powerful tool to predict tumor control. Specifically, current results might be helpful for clinicians in the decision-making process regarding liver oligometastatic patient selection as well as the individual therapy stratification distinguishing between slowly local progressing patients and rapidly progressing patients.",exclusion,,,10.1259/bjr.20180058,,,,

Patients with Child A5 liver function had a better median OS than A6 and B7 patients [21 vs 11 vs 8 months]. Also, tumours with GTV < 350 cc volumes had a better OS compared to GTV of greater than 350 cc [24 months vs 8 months, p value = 0.004]. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that SBRT can be used safely and effectively to treat inoperable HCCs with or without prior loco-regional therapies, resulting in good local control and survival with acceptable toxicity.

Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT; Cyberknife) is a novel treatment modality in the management of HCC. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of Cyberknife (CK) in the management of HCC. Method(s): A retrospective analysis of consecutive HCC patients who were treated with CK from January 2014 to March 2018 at a single tertiary center was performed. Patients were treated with CK when local ablation was not technically possible or when lesions failed to respond to other treatments. Contrast enhanced MRI was used for diagnosis and follow up.Patient survival and time to any progression or lesional progression was analysed with Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Results were analysed per patient and per treated lesion. Result(s): 43 patients and 58 lesions were treated and followed for a mean of 14.4 months. Most patients had good performance status (ECOG 0 {76.7%} or 1 {20.9%}), compensated cirrhosis (Child's A {79.1%} or B {20.9%}) and early stage disease (BCLC 0 {4.7%} or A {65.1%}). 30 patients had a single lesion, 11 had two lesions and 2 had three lesions. Mean lesion diameter was 20.1 mm (14-80 mm). Technical contraindications to ablation accounted for 27 treatments, the remainder were due to previous treatment failure. 11 patients died in the study period, 5 related to HCC. Overall survival was 81.6% at 1 year and 50.4% at 2 years. 19 patients progressed, but only 4 patients (5 lesions) had a local recurrence of a treated lesion. 95.6% of lesions had on-going complete response at 1 year and 71.7% at 2 years. 6 patients were bridged to transplant and 2 remain on the waitlist. Superior survival was associated with better performance status (p<0.001), earlier Childs-Pugh (p<0.001) and BCLC stage (p<0.001), and lower AFP (p<0.05); but not age, lesion size or number, or whether CK was a primary or re-treatment. 27 patients had no LFT derangement post treatment, 14 had a grade 1 increase, and 2 a grade 2 or 3 increase. Only 4 patients reported side effects (1 nausea, 1 pain, 2 fatigue). Conclusion(s): CK therapy for HCC is both effective and safe and can be considered in patients as therapy for lesions that are not amenable to other locoregional therapies. The results suggest that future controlled trials comparing CK with other loco-regional therapies are warranted. (Figure Presented).",exclusion,No comparator,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hep.30257,,,,

We investigated factors associated with clinical outcomes for liver metastases treated with SBRT from a multi-center, international patient registry. METHODS: Patients with liver metastases treated with SBRT were identified in the RSSearch® Patient Registry. Patient, tumor and treatment characteristics associated with treatment outcomes were assessed. Dose fractionations were normalized to BED(10). Overall survival (OS) and local control (LC) were evaluated using Kaplan Meier analysis and log-rank test. RESULTS: The study included 427 patients with 568 liver metastases from 25 academic and community-based centers. Median age was 67 years (31-91 years). Colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC) was the most common primary cancer. 73% of patients received prior chemotherapy. Median tumor volume was 40 cm(3) (1.6-877 cm(3)), median SBRT dose was 45 Gy (12-60 Gy) delivered in a median of 3 fractions [1-5]. At a median follow-up of 14 months (1-91 months) the median overall survival (OS) was 22 months. Median OS was greater for patients with CRC (27 mo), breast (21 mo) and gynecological (25 mo) metastases compared to lung (10 mo), other gastro-intestinal (GI) (18 mo) and pancreatic (6 mo) primaries (p < 0.0001). Smaller tumor volumes (< 40 cm(3)) correlated with improved OS (25 months vs 15 months p = 0.0014). BED(10) ≥ 100 Gy was also associated with improved OS (27 months vs 15 months p < 0.0001). Local control (LC) was evaluable in 430 liver metastases from 324 patients. Two-year LC rates was better for BED(10) ≥ 100 Gy (77.2% vs 59.6%) and the median LC was better for tumors < 40 cm(3) (52 vs 39 months). There was no difference in LC based on histology of the primary tumor. CONCLUSIONS: In a large, multi-institutional series of patients with liver metastasis treated with SBRT, reasonable LC and OS was observed. OS and LC depended on dose and tumor volume, while OS varied by primary tumor. Future prospective trials on the role of SBRT for liver metastasis from different primaries in the setting of multidisciplinary management including systemic therapy, is warranted.

Materials/Methods: This is a prospective, observational, single-arm phase II study. 49 patients with oligometastases from CRC were prospectively selected for SBRT between January 2016 and February 2019. Inclusion criteria are: histologically proven CRC, age >=18 years old, controlled primary tumor, controlled extra-hepatic or extra-pulmonary lesions, ECOG performance status 0-1, at least one measurable lesion but less than 5, not a candidate for surgical resection. Patients who have liver metastasis undergo a percutaneous, Ultrasound-guided, fiducial marker implantations, then simulate with abdominal compression using 4-dimentional CT (4D-CT) and MRI. The gross tumor volume (GTV) is delineated in each 4D-CT phase, the internal target volume (ITV) was the envelope of GTVs from each phase of 4D-CT. The planning treatment volume (PTV) was ITV plus an isotropic margin of 3-5 mm. For patients of lung metastasis, 4D-CT simulation or simulation in DIBH are all allowed. The dose and fractionation are chosen according to the location and size of lesion. Cone-beam CT (CBCT) will be used to verify patient positioning at every treatment. The primary endpoint is 3-year local control rate (LC), secondary endpoint is >= G3 treatment-related toxicities and 3-year overall survival. We plan to enroll 50 patients until December 2020. All patients signed the informed consent, the study is approved by Ethics Committee. Result(s): Forty-five patients (59 lesions) are amenable to analysis, including 32 males and 13 females. The median age is 62 years old (39-79). There are 35 hepatic lesions, 21 pulmonary lesions, and 3 lesions located in lymph nodes. The most common primary site is rectum (30 patients), while 12 patients have colon cancer, and 3 patients have bi-primary carcinoma. The median ITV is 12.612 cm3 (1.07-160.54 cm3). The median PTV is 31.726 cm3 (5.296- 323.117cm3). The median BED for lung metastasis is 100Gy (72Gy - 119Gy) and 96Gy (48-151.2 Gy) for hepatic metastasis. The median follow-up is 21 months for pulmonary lesions and 16 months for hepatic lesions. At the time of analysis, 13 lesions have local recurrence, 3 lesions are pulmonary, 1 lesion is of spleen, another 9 lesions are hepatic. One-year LC is 78.8%. 1-y pulmonary LC is 92.9%, and 68.7 % for hepatic lesion. Four patients died. The median OS is 10.5 months. One-year OS is 94.5%. Treatments were well-tolerated. For patients who have liver metastasis, no patient developed grade 3 radiation-induced liver disease. Some patients had transiently increased levels of hepatic transaminase, which normalized within 3 months after SBRT. Other side effects are nausea, anorexia, fatigue, gastritis. No patients had severe (grade 3-5) pulmonary toxicity. Some patients may have radiological change, but no clinical symptoms presented. Conclusion(s): SBRT is safe and effective for oligometastases from colorectal cancer under respiratory motion management and robust quality assurance.Copyright © 2019",exclusion,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.06.174,,,,

Between August 2008 and November 2012, 59 spinal metastatic lesions in 39 patients were treated with SBRT. Fourteen lesions (23.7%) were re-irradiated to treat recurrence after prior radiotherapy. Patients were treated with a median radiation dose of 27 Gy (range, 18-35 Gy) in a median of three fractions (range, one to five) using the CyberKnife Xsight Spine tracking system. Median planning target volume of the 59 spinal metastatic lesions was 37.4 cm(3) (range, 0.9-301.4 cm(3)). Radiation was prescribed to the median 80% isodose line that encompassed at least 90% of the tumor volume. The revised Tokuhashi scoring system and the Tomita scoring system were adopted to predict survival of patients. Local progression was defined as tumor progression by imaging, or if other therapy such as surgery or re-irradiation was given after SBRT, as salvage treatment. The median follow-up period was 7.4 months (range, 1.1-42.5 months). Four of 59 (6.8%) lesions experienced local progression, and all of them occurred within 1-year. Two of four local progressions occurred in re-irradiated tumors, which received 21 Gy in three fractions. With respect to treatment site-specific survival (TSS), better performance status and no visceral metastases were associated with a superior outcome (p = 0.011 and p = .001, respectively). With respect to overall survival (OS), better performance status was marginally related to superior outcome (p = 0.096). The revised Tokuhashi scoring system and the Tomita scoring system predicted OS and TSS in patients treated with SBRT. Two patients developed vertebral compression fractures at 1.2 and 1.4 months after SBRT with no evidence of tumor progression. There was no radiation-induced myelopathy. SBRT with a CyberKnife is a safe and effective treatment modality to achieve local control in spinal metastases patients, including those with a previous history of conventional RT. SBRT should be considered for those patients with a relatively indolent primary tumor, good performance status, and no visceral metastases. Survival of these patients can potentially be prolonged by long-term control of spinal metastases.",exclusion,,,10.7785/tcrt.2012.500411,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with 1-4 hepatic lesions and tumor diameter ≤9 cm received SBRT at 46.8Gy ± 3.7 in 4-6 fractions. The primary end point was local control with at least 6 months of radiographic followup, and secondary end points were toxicity and survival. RESULTS: Eighty-seven assessable patients (114 lesions) completed liver SBRT for hepatoma (39) or isolated metastases (48) with a median followup of 20.3 months (range 1.9-64.1). Fourteen patients underwent liver transplant with SBRT as a bridging treatment or for tumor downsizing. Eight patients completed hepatic resections in combination with planned SBRT for unresectable tumors. Two-year local control was 96% for hepatoma and 93.8% for metastases; it was 100% for lesions ≤4 cm. Two-year overall survival was 82.3% (hepatoma) and 64.3% (metastases).

Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an alternative ablative local therapy that delivers high RT doses in a few fractions to the cancer, sparing surrounding critical tissue. We have performed a systematic review of published trials to evaluate the efficacy of SBRT as a primary modality therapy for CRC liver oligometastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Pubmed, and EMBASE for publications regarding SBRT for CRC liver metastases. Overall survival (OS: median, 1- and 2-year OS %) was the primary endpoint, and median PFS and one- and two-year local control (LC) were the secondary endpoints. A random-effect model pooled-analysis was performed to calculate the aggregated OS rates at 1 and 2 years as well as the one- and two-year LC. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies, encompassing 656 patients, were included in the analysis. The pooled one- and two-year OS were 67.18% (95% CI, 42.1-92.2) and 56.5% (95% CI, 36.7-76.2), respectively. Median PFS and OS were 11.5 and 31.5 months. The pooled one-year LC was 67% (95% CI, 43.8-90.2), while the pooled two-year LC was 59.3% (95% CI, 37.2-81.5). Correlation analysis revealed a moderate/poor linear relationship between the SBRT (BED10) dose and LC (p = 0.001, R = 0.47)/OS (p = 0.001, R = 0.29) at 2 years. Mild-moderate and severe liver toxicity were 30.7% and 8.7%. CONCLUSION: SBRT for liver oligometastases is an effective option for patients with advanced CRC, with encouraging local control and survival. However, a definitive validation in large randomised studies is required, due to the retrospective or non-randomised nature of the included studies and the limitations of series with different doses/schedules of treatment.",exclusion,,,10.1016/j.radonc.2018.06.035,,,,

This study reports on the safety and efficacy of SBRT in small HCC tumours (≤5 cm) in the province of British Columbia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 2011 and July 2015, 31 patients with Child-Pugh Class A or B, with small HCCs measuring ≤5 cm were treated with SBRT at our institution. Primary end points were local control, progression-free survival, overall survival and toxicity. RESULTS: Thirty-four hepatomas (median size 3.3 cm, range 1.3-5.0 cm) were treated. The median follow-up was 18.3 months. Twenty-six patients (84%) had received previous liver-directed treatments. Most patients (88%) were treated with 45 Gy in three or five fractions. Six patients (19%) had worsened Child-Pugh score by two or more points during follow-up; overall 32% of patients experienced ≥ grade 3 + toxicities. One-year local control and overall survival were 94 and 84%, respectively. One-year progression-free survival was 49%; 81% of patients with disease progression received further HCC therapy. On univariate analysis, small tumour size predicted for improved overall survival (P = 0.01) whereas prescription biological equivalent dose (BED(10)) ≥100Gy(10) approached significance (P = 0.06). CONCLUSION: SBRT provides high local control to small inoperable HCC. SBRT can be delivered safely even after previous liver-directed therapies and further liver therapies can follow treatment with SBRT. Although overall 32% of patients experienced ≥ grade 3 + toxicities, and 19% had a deterioration in Child-Pugh score of two or more points, these changes were mainly transient with minimal clinical impact. Despite excellent local control, disease progression outside of the irradiated site remains prominent.

While surgery remains the standard of care treatment for localized disease, many patients are unfit due to their advanced age and medical comorbidities. In these patients, an active surveillance strategy or ablative therapies, including radiofrequency/microwave ablation or cryotherapy, can be offered. Such options have limitations particularly with fast growing, or larger tumors. A promising ablative therapy option to consider is stereo-tactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). SBRT refers to high dose, focally ablative radiation delivered in a short time (3-5 fractions), and is safe and effective in many other cancer sites, including lung, liver and spine. SBRT offers potential advantages in the primary kidney cancer setting due to its ablative dosing (overcoming the notion of ""radio-resistance""), short treatment duration (important in an elderly population), low toxicity profile (enabling SBRT to treat larger RCCs than other ablative modalities), and non-invasiveness. To date, there is limited long-term prospective data on the outcomes of SBRT in primary RCC. However, early evidence is intriguing with respect to excellent local control and low toxicity; however, most studies vary in terms of technique and radiation dosing used. Well-designed prospective cohort studies with clearly defined and standardized techniques, dosing, follow-up, and integration of quality of life outcomes will be essential to further establish the role of SBRT in management of inoperable, localized RCC.",exclusion,,,10.5489/cuaj.2900,,,,

Use of highly targeted, hypofractionated regimens of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is now a primary management option for patients with oligometastatic disease. METHODS: The properties of SBRT are summarized and the results of retrospective and prospective studies of SBRT use in the management of oligometastases are reviewed. Future directions of SBRT, including optimizing dose and fractionation schedules, are also discussed. RESULTS: SBRT can deliver highly conformal, dosed radiation treatments for ablative tumors in a few treatment sessions. Phase 1/2 trials and retrospective institutional results support use of SBRT as a treatment option for oligometastatic disease metastasized to the lung, liver, and spine, and SBRT offers adequate toxicity profiles with good rates of local control. Future directions will involve optimizing dose and fractionation schedules for select histologies to improve rates of local control while limiting toxicity to normal structures.

However, less than 5% of patients are ultimately candidates due to frequent comorbidities and graft shortage. Traditionally, radiotherapy played a limited role in the treatment of HCC due to the risk of radiationinduced liver disease. Development of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) allows delivery of high-dose conformal radiotherapy with limited liver toxicity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency and safety of SBRT as a local treatment for inoperable HCC. Material and Methods A prospective phase II trial of SBRT for patients with unique HCC was conducted from 2009 to 2014 in three French institutions. Eligibility criteria include d a single HCC lesion; without extra hepatic extension; unsuitable for standard loco regional therapies; with a tumor size from 1 to 6 cm. For patients with cirrhosis, only Child-Pugh (CP) A patients were enrolled. The SBRT dose was 45 Gy in 3 fractions delivered in 8 to 10 days. Primary end point was local control at 18 months, defined as a non-progressive disease of irradiated HCC by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors). Results A total of 44 patients were evaluable. Patients were 43 to 91 years of age (median 72 year). The median tumor size was 28 mm (range, 10-60 mm). Median follow-up was 3.0 years (range, 0.32 months to 4.3 years). All 44 patients had cirrhosis, 38 (88%) were CP grade A, and 5 (12%) grade B. 5 patients (11%) had portal vein involvement and 17 patients (39%) had a portal hypertension. No patients received prior local treatment. Thirteen patients (31%) presented a grade >= 3 acute adverse event of which liver biology perturbation was the most encountered (20,9%). Three patients (10%) experienced a decline in CP at 3 months post-SBRT. There was no grade >= 3 chronic adverse event reported. The 18- and 24-month local control rates were 98% (95% CI, 85%-99%) and 94% (95% CI, 79%-99%), respectively. The 18- and 24-month overall survival rates were 72% (95% CI, 56%-83%) and 69% (95% CI, 53%-81%), respectively. Median survival was 3.5 years. Conclusion Local control and overall survival after SBRT for untreated solitary HCC were excellent despite candidates being unfit for resection and ablation treatments. SBRT should be considered, as bridging to transplant or as definitive therapy for those ineligible for transplant. It should be considered in multidisciplinary committees alongside other localized standard treatments including radiofrequency ablation or transarterial chemoembolization, depending on patients' characteristics, and advantages and disadvantages of each technique.",exclusion,,,,,,,

Result(s): 68/70 tumors were successfully ablated at first ablation session (97% primary technical efficacy rate). Local tumor recurrence developed in 5 of 70 nodules (7.1%). The complication rate above Clavien-Dindo Grade III was 6.5% (3 of 46). The overall survival (OS) rates at 1-, 3-, and 5- years from the date of the first SRFA were 84.6, 50.5, and 37.9% for HCC patients and 87.5%, 52.5% at 1-, and 3-years for CRC patients. The disease-free survival (DFS) for HCC patients after SRFA was 79.1, 35.6, and 23.7%, at 1-, 3-, and 5- years, and 75%, 22.5% at 1-, and 3-years for CRC patients. There were no significant differences in terms of technical efficacy, local recurrences, major complications, OS and DFS compared to the control group. Conclusion(s): SRFA in octogenarians is a safe, feasible and useful option in the management of primary or metastatic liver tumors with no significant difference in outcomes compared to a younger control group.© Copyright © 2019 Schullian, Putzer, Silva, Laimer, Kolbitsch and Bale.",exclusion,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2019.00929,,,,

METHODS: A matched pair analysis of 36 patients who underwent MWA of primary or secondary liver malignancies (10 hepatocellular carcinoma and 8 metastases) was conducted. A total of 18 patients undergoing SMWA were included in this prospective study. Patients were matched in terms of tumor size, liver segment and entity to retrospective CMWA procedures. The endpoints were procedure time, accuracy of needle placement, technical success rate, complication rate and dose-length product (DLP). RESULTS: The procedure durations were 23.9 min (SD 3.7) for CMWA and 21.8 min (SD 16.3) for SMWA (p = 0.22). The procedural accuracy for SMWA and CMWA was identical for both groups (3.7 mm). The total DLP was significantly lower for SMWA than for CMWA (2115 mGy cm (SD 276) vs. 3109 mGy cm (SD 1137), respectively; p < 0.01). Complete ablation without residual tumor was observed in 94% (17 of 18) of SMWA and in 83% (15 of 18) of CMWA patients (p = 0.31). No complications occurred.

The purpose of this study was to compare CT-navigated stereotactic IRE (SIRE) needle placement to non-navigated conventional IRE (CIRE) for percutaneous ablation of liver malignancies. Materials and Methods. A prospective trial including a total of 20 patients was conducted with 10 patients in each arm of the study. IRE procedures were guided using either CT fluoroscopy (CIRE) or a stereotactic planning and navigation system (SIRE). Primary endpoint was procedure time. Secondary endpoints were accuracy of needle placement, technical success rate, complication rate and dose-length product (DLP). Results. A total of 20 IRE procedures were performed to ablate hepatic malignancies (16 HCC, 4 liver metastases), 10 procedures in each arm. Mean time for placement of IRE electrodes in SIRE was significantly shorter with 27 ± 8 min compared to 87 ± 30 min for CIRE (p < 0.001). Accuracy of needle placement for SIRE was higher than CIRE (2.2 mm vs. 3.3 mm mean deviation, p < 0.001). The total DLP and the fluoroscopy DLP were significantly lower in SIRE compared to CIRE. Technical success rate and complication rates were equal in both arms. Conclusion. SIRE demonstrated a significant reduction of procedure length and higher accuracy compared to CIRE. Stereotactic navigation has the potential to reduce radiation dose for the patient and the radiologist without increasing the risk of complications or impaired technical success compared to CIRE.",exclusion,,,10.7717/peerj.2277,,,,

Outcomes of SBRT for liver tumors unsuitable for ablation or surgical resection were evaluated. A total of 79 patients treated with SBRT for primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) between 2004 and 2012 in six Japanese institutions were studied retrospectively. Patients treated with SBRT preceded by trans-arterial chemoembolization were eligible. Their median age was 73 years, 76% were males, and their Child-Pugh scores were Grades A (85%) and B (11%) before SBRT. The median biologically effective dose (α/β = 10 Gy) was 96.3 Gy. The median follow-up time was 21.0 months for surviving patients. The 2-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and distant metastasis-free survival were 53%, 40% and 76%, respectively. Sex and serum PIVKA-II values were significant predictive factors for OS. Hypovascular or hypervascular types of HCC, sex and clinical stage were significant predictive factors for PFS. The 2-year PFS was 66% in Stage I vs 18% in Stages II-III. Multivariate analysis indicated that clinical stage was the only significant predictive factor for PFS. No Grade 3 laboratory toxicities in the acute, sub-acute, and chronic phases were observed. PFS after SBRT for liver tumor was satisfactory, especially for Stage I HCC, even though these patients were unsuitable for resection and ablation. SBRT is safe and might be an alternative to resection and ablation.",exclusion,,,10.1093/jrr/rru130,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with 1-3 inoperable HCC lesions with diameter ≤6 cm were treated by SBRT. According to lesions size and liver function, two prescription regimens were adopted: 48-75 Gy in three fractions or 36-60 Gy in six fractions. SBRT was delivered using the volumetric modulated arc therapy technique with flattening filter-free photon beams. The primary end points of this study were in-field local control (LC) and toxicity. Secondary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Forty-three patients with 63 HCC lesions were irradiated. All patients had Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A or B disease. Thirty lesions (48%) were treated with 48-75 Gy in three consecutive fractions, and 33 (52%) received 36-60 Gy in six fractions. Median follow-up was 8 months (range 3-43 months). Actuarial LC at 6, 12 and 24 months was 94.2 ± 3.3, 85.8 ± 5.5 and 64.4 ± 11.5%, respectively. A biological equivalent dose (BED) >100 Gy and GTV size were significant prognostic factors for LC in univariate analysis (p < 0.001 and p < 0.02). Median OS was 18.0 ± 5.8 months. Actuarial OS at 6, 12 and 24 months was 91.1 ± 4.9, 77.9 ± 8.2 and 45.3 ± 14.0%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that OS is correlated with LC (p < 0.04), BED >100 (p < 0.05) and cumulative gross tumor volume GTV <5 cm (p < 0.04). Median PFS was 8 months, with a 1-year PFS rate of 41%. A significant (≥ grade 3) toxicity was observed in seven patients (16%) 2-6 months after the completion of the treatment. No classic radiation-induced liver disease was observed. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a safe and effective therapeutic option for HCC lesions unsuitable to standard loco-regional therapies, with acceptable local control rates and low treatment-related toxicity.

random-journal.pdf,LivP224,"W.H., Smith",2019,English,LIV.M:#2;LIV.P:#2,The Effect of Radiation Therapy on the Objective Response and Outcomes with Nivolumab for Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Purpose/Objective(s): Nivolumab has been shown to be effective as second line therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but the objective response rate (ORR) is only 18% with just 1% achieving a complete response (CR). Data in other disease sites suggest that patients treated with radiation therapy (RT) are more likely to demonstrate an OR to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Given the ability of RT to act as an ""in situ"" vaccine, this study explores if exposure to RT increases the ORR to nivolumab in HCC. Materials/Methods: We retrospectively queried our institutional IRB-approved HCC database for patients treated with external beam RT between 1/2012-9/2018. Patients were included who received RT prior to on concurrent with nivolumab initiation (upfront RT) or who received RT to residual or progressive disease following nivolumab initiation (salvage RT cohort). Patients were excluded who had mixed histology cancers, other active cancers, and who received prior Y-90. The primary endpoint was ORR based on mRECIST criteria. ORR comparisons were performed by univariate logistic regression. Secondary endpoints included progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Survival outcomes were determined using Kaplan-Meier estimates and compared for responders and non-responders using the log-rank test. Result(s): We identified 84 patients who received RT in combination with nivolumab, of these 35 met inclusion criteria; 26 with upfront RT and 9 with salvage RT. Median follow-up was 7.1 months. Most patients had metastatic disease (65.7%) and 14 (40%) had gross vascular invasion. RT was delivered to the liver in 24 cases (64.9%) and with SBRT technique in 17 cases (45.9%) to a median dose of 37.5 Gy. Among those with upfront RT exposure, the ORR was 34.6% including 3 patients (11.5%) with CR and 6 patients (23.1%) with partial response (PR). Of these, 6 demonstrated responses outside RT treated lesions while 3 had responses in RT treated lesions with no evaluable disease beyond the RT field; in no case was an OR isolated to an RT treated lesion with unresponsive disease elsewhere. In the salvage cohort, the ORR was 11.1% consisting of a single patient who achieved a PR to the RT treated site alone with stable disease elsewhere. The median PFS for responders was not reached compared to 2.3 months for non-responders (p < 0.001). Median OS for responders was not reached compared to 22.7 months for non-responders (p = 0.024). Conclusion(s): Exposure to upfront RT was associated with a substantially increased ORR to nivolumab in HCC compared to historical controls. However, salvage RT to sites of residual or progressive disease while on nivolumab failed to stimulate an OR outside of the RT field in our cohort. These data need to be verified in a larger prospective cohort to see if combination immunotherapy and radiation can improve outcomes for patients with advanced HCC.Copyright © 2019",exclusion,Wrong intervention,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.06.279,,,,

The optimal management of these patients remains unclear with the treatment approach currently undergoing a paradigm shift. The potential benefit of aggressive metastasis directed local treatment with surgery and/or radiotherapy (RT) in combination with systemic therapy is bolstered predominantly by retrospective analyses but also by a growing number of non-randomized prospective studies regarding the use of ablative RT techniques including stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), alternatively termed stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), directed at the primary tumor (if present) and all metastatic sites. Long-term survival is possible in a subset of patients treated aggressively in this manner. The challenge for the clinical oncology community moving forward is appropriately selecting patients for this treatment approach based on clinical, imaging, and molecular features and increasing enrollment of patients to prospective clinical trials to more definitively determine the added benefit and appropriate timing of aggressive metastasis directed therapy in the oligometastatic setting.",exclusion,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1586/14737140.2015.1105745,,,,

We examine the effects of radiation dose as measured by the biological equivalent dose (BED) in a cohort of HCC patients identified in a large national database. Materials/Methods: Patients with unresectable, non-metastatic HCC that received SBRT were identified from the National Cancer Database (2004-2013). Survival outcomes were compared using Kaplan Meier curves and log-rank tests, and multivariate Cox (MVC) proportional hazards model to examine the predictors of survival. BED was calculated for each patient using the delivered dose, number of fractions, and an a/b ratio of 10. Result(s): A total of 461 patients met the inclusion criteria. Median patient age and tumor size were 62 years (27-90) and 3.2 cm (0.6-17), respectively. Charlson comorbidity index score was 0 in 61%, 1 in 20%, and 2 in 19%. By stage 56% were stage I, 29% were stage II, and 15% were stage III. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was elevated in 52.9%, and 32% received chemotherapy. The median BED was 100 Gy (22.5-208.0), which was also the most common dose fractionation (50 Gy in 5 fractions) in 21.7%. Other common scheme included: 40 Gy in 5 fractions (BED of 72 Gy) in 14.8%, 48 Gy in 3 fractions (BED of 124 Gy) in 10.7%, and 45 Gy in 3 fractions (BED of 112.5 Gy) in 6.7%. For this entire cohort, the median OS after SBRT was 20.3 months. An apparent dose response was observed with improved survival with increasing BED. The median and 1-year OS were 15.3 months and 56.6% for BED-75, 18.3 months and 67.5% for BED>75 and 100, and 37.2 months and 81.4% for BED>100, P< 0.001. When controlling for other factors (tumor size, AFP, stage, comorbidity level, age, type of institution and type of insurance), an increased BED was associated with longer OS regardless of how BED was analyzed (see table 1). In addition, elevated AFP (HR 1.803, 95% CI 1.235-2.632, P = 0.002) and increased tumor size (HR 1.085, 95% CI 1.023-1.150, P = 0.006) were associated with worse survival. Conclusion(s): In this sizable cohort of HCC patients treated with SBRT, those who received higher BED appear to have improved OS, even when controlling for multiple other factors. While many factors influence the (Table presented) determination of dose for any given patient, this data may suggests that efforts to safely increase BED may result in improved survival outcomes. This concept, as well as strategies, to achieve it should be investigated in prospective clinical trials.",exclusion,No comparator,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2016.06.972,,,,

We investigated the role of different clinical and inflammatory parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included all patients treated with SRT for 1-5 oligometastases between 2003 and 2017 in our center. Patients were randomized between a model training set (2/3) and a separate validation set (1/3). A Cox regression model was built, validated and risk points were attributed to the resulting parameters. RESULTS: 403 patients received SRT for 760 metastases. Treated sites were mainly lung, liver, nodal areas, and brain. Most common primaries were colorectal and lung cancer. Median follow-up for living patients reached 42 months and median overall survival (MS) was 26.6 months (95% CI 23.8-29.3). Five independent adverse factors were discriminated: male sex, synchronous timing of oligometastases, brain metastasis, non-adenocarcinoma histology, KPS <80. A risk score is formed by summation of the points of each factor (M:4, T:2, B:7, N:7, K:8). Four risk groups were defined: (1) 0-2 points: MS 41.2 months (95% CI 30.2-52.3); (2) 3-8 points: 29.3 months (24.6-34.0); (3) 9-13 points: 17.4 months (10.1-24.7), and (4) 14-28 points: 7.9 months (5.5-10.3). CONCLUSION: We propose a prognostic score applicable in a variety of primary tumors and disease locations, including presence of brain metastases. The nomogram and risk groups can be used to stratify patients in new trials and to support individualized care for oligometastatic patients.

Results of large case series of selected patients treated with complete surgical resection of metastatic lesions suggest that this approach substantially improves survival rates to around 30‐60%. Other techniques such as radiofrequency or microwave ablation (RFA, MWA), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) can also be applied in local treatment. Curative treatment options are generally not available for patients with extensive hepatic and/or extrahepatic mCRC. These patients primarily receive palliative systemic treatment consisting of combination chemotherapy as well as targeted agents. So far, reports on the benefit of local treatment for metastases in multi‐organ mCRC have major limitations, including being small, non‐randomized, single‐center and retrospective. The benefit from local treatment of metastases for these patients should be established to allow for interruption of the standard systemic therapy and exposure to possible adverse events from local treatment. Methods: The 'ORCHESTRA' trial is a randomized multicenter clinical trial for patients with multi‐organ mCRC, comparing the combination of chemotherapy and maximal tumor debulking versuschemotherapy alone (NCT01792934 ). We will examine the interplay of both efficacy and toxicity for the combination of systemic chemotherapy and locoregional therapy. Our study design incorporates systemic as well as local therapy in the experimental arm and combines local treatment modalities to pursue maximal tumor debulking. We aim to improve overall survival of patients with multi‐organ mCRC by maximal tumor debulking after induction chemotherapy with at least six months. A total of 478 patients will be included to meet the primary endpoint (power 80%, type I error rate 5%). We define local treatments feasible when they can be performed within a 3‐month time period to prevent extensive delay of systemic therapy.

Materials/Methods: Patients who were discussed in a multidisciplinary tumor board over a predefined time of 12 months were offered prospective study participation. Patients with locally advanced HCC had SBRT when TACE was contraindicated, in case of progressive disease after TACE or when TACE was rejected by the patient. All other patients had as standard of care TACE treatment. Impact of predefined patient and treatment related factors on HRQOL (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-CR29) was evaluated. Primary endpoint was feasibility. Result(s): Between 06/2016 and 06/2017 19 patients had TACE and 19 patients SBRT, of whom one patient dropped out during SBRT because of pulmonal progression. Characteristics are shown in Table 1. In the SBRT group 1 and 2-year overall survival rate was 56% and 74% in the TACE group (p=0.1). The 1-year local control rate (LCR) was 90% in the SBRT group and 70% in the TACE group(p=0.2) and the PFS was at a median of 7 months in the SBRT group and 11 months in the TACE group (p=0.04). There was no statistically significant difference in the QOL at baseline for both groups, and no difference between baseline and follow-up. One patient had a grade 5 fistula in the SBRT group and one patient had a grade 4-5 hepatic failure in the TACE group, 2 a hepatic failure grade 3, 1 grade 3 pancreatitis, 1 grade 3 cholangitis and one abscess in the TACE group. Four patients in the SBRT arm died within one month after therapy due to on each pneumonia, urosepsis, sepsis due to necrotizing fasciitis after hip-endoprosthesis and massive progression. Conclusion(s): The primary endpoint feasibility was achieved with 38 patients included during 12 months in a single center. SBRT, though started at a median of 17 months later after primary diagnosis compared to TACE leads to good local control in far advanced HCC with acceptable toxicity compared with TACE despite of more advanced disease in the SBRT group. A randomized trial is required to further elucidate the role of SBRT in this setting and is in preparation on the basis of this trial.

Materials/Methods: Three hospitals in China participated in this study from February 2013 to December 2015. Inclusion criteria were that Child-Pugh A patients with the maximum diameter of a single lesion was less than 5 cm whereas the maximum diameter of each lesion was not more than 3 cm when the number of lesions was less than 3. All enrolled patients were over 18 with more than 6-month life expectancy, the un-irradiated liver volume should be more than 750 cc, ECOG score was 0, 1, or 2 and the lesion was inoperable. Blood biochemistry test criteria were a albumin (ALB) concentration >2.5 g/dL, a total bilirubin (TBI) concentration <3 mg/dL, a INR concentration <1.5s, a creatinine (Cr) concentration <2.0 mg/dL and an ALT as well as AST concentration was less than 3 times to the upper limit of normal value. Fifty-eight patients in total with locally unresectable primary HCC were treated by SBRT with 3 fractions of 45 Gy in consecutive 3 days. The primary endpoint is local control (LC), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and hepatic toxicity after SBRT. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate local control (LC), overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS). Analyses were based on intention-to-treat. A P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Result(s): Fifty-eight patients were included in this study, median follow-up was 12 months, 47 were male, and 11 were female. The median GTV volume was 7.5 mL. The LC rate was 100% at 1 and 2 years.

Little research has looked into the safety and efficacy of combining capecitabine and irinotecan (CAPIRI) with C due to early studies with doubts on its safety. We hypothesized that by means of a modified regime, mCAPIRI-C could be a potentially safe and efficacious alternative to FOLFIRI-C. Method(s): We performed a single-centre, retrospective cohort investigating the clinical outcome of mCAPIRI-C among CRC patients with upfront unresectable liver-only metastases identified at Hepatobiliary Multidisciplinary meetings of Tuen Mun Hospital during June 2012 - June 2018. Serial clinical, biochemical and radiological assessments were performed for evaluation. Result(s): The population (N=47) had a median age of 61 years old (range 40-72 years old), a majority of men (n=32, 68%), colon primary (n=36, 77%), right-sided (n=6, 13%), synchronous tumors and metastases (n=36, 77%), while almost half of them had fewer than 5 liver metastases (n=23, 49%).

With the use of mCAPIRI-C, we have achieved a high total conversion rate of 62% (n=29), with 45% (n=21) of the population subsequently undergoing R0 resection, 13% (n=6) underwent other potentially curative interventions including radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SBRT) and only 2% (n=1) had an R2 resection. We have also evaluated the radiological response of conversion therapy with mCAPIRI-C by means of the RECIST 1.1 criteria, with a remarkable overall response rate of up to 83% (i.e. complete response CR, partial response PR or stable disease SD) (n=39), of which 6% (n=3) achieved radiological CR and 77% (n=36) achieved PR. Median follow-up was 18.7 months (range 1.7-52.1months) with an overall median PFS up to 15.1 months and an overall median OS of 40.5 months. Of those who have received subsequent potential curative therapies (surgery/RFA/SBRT), a significant benefit versus those who did not undergo any subsequent liver-directed therapies was seen, with a PFS gain of 15.1 months (P < .001) and OS was not yet reached (P= .002). Treatment was well-tolerated overall with only 2 patients (4%) experiencing Grade 4 neutropenia and no other reported Grade 4 toxicities. The most common Grade 3 toxicity was neutropenia (n=5, 11%) and a strikingly low amount of Grade 3 skin reactions (n=3, 6%), diarrhea (n=2, 4%) and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (n=1, 2%) reactions were reported. There were also no treatment-related 60-day mortalities nor 30-day postoperative mortalities. Conclusion(s): The use of mCAPIRI-C appears to be safe and efficacious among CRC patients with unresectable liver-only metastases. Our results suggest a high clinical response rate and an encouraging rate of subsequent potentially curative liver-directed therapies with significant survival benefits. It has laid a solid ground for further prospective, multi-centred randomized trials.",exclusion,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdz183,,,,

Method(s): In this retrospective case-control study, 60 patients (14 with Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 46 with metastatic liver tumors) with CT 'invisible' lesions underwent SRFA using MRI-fusion between June 2005 and June 2018 ('fusion group'). For comparison, 60 patients who underwent SRFA without image fusion were selected using nearest neighbor propensity score matching ('control group'). Endpoints consisted of local tumor control, safety, overall and disease-free survival. Result(s): Major complications occurred in 6/69 ablations (8.7%) in the fusion group and in 6/89 ablations (6.7%) in the control group (p = 0.434). Primary technical efficacy rate (i.e., successful initial ablation) was 96.6% (28/29) for HCC and 97.9% (166/170) for metastatic disease in the fusion group and 100% (33/33) and 93.3% (184/194) in the control group, respectively (p = 0.468 and 0.064). Local recurrence (LR) was observed in 1/29 (3.5%) HCCs and in 6/170 metastases (4.0%) in the fusion group and 1/33 (3.0%) and 21/196 (10.7%) in the control group, respectively. The LR rate of metastasis in the control group was significantly higher (p = 0.007), although differences in OS and DFS did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion(s): Image fusion using pre-procedural MRI allows for ablation of CT-'invisible' liver tumors that are otherwise untreatable. Moreover, local oncological control was higher in metastatic liver tumors versus matched controls which suggests it could be useful tool for all stereotactic radiofrequency ablation procedures.Copyright © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively collected pretreatment, detailed toxicity (≤6 months posttreatment), and outcomes data from 48 patients. Deaths were examined for association with RILD. Univariate and multivariate Cox models defined significant predictors of overall survival (OS)/RILD-specific survival (RILD-SS). RESULTS: With median follow-up of 13 months, 23 patients (48%) had an increase in Child-Pugh (CP) score (≥2, 25%) and 3 (6%) had ≥G3 transaminase elevation. Of 18 deaths, 6 were potentially ascribed to RILD. Univariate analysis showed that CP score increases of ≥1 and ≥2 and CP class change predicted OS, as did ≥G3 aspartate transaminase (AST) elevation and ≥1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) AST toxicity grade change. On multivariate analysis, CP score increase of ≥2 and ≥1 CTCAE AST toxicity grade change were the strongest independent nonclassic RILD predictors of OS. For RILD-SS, CP score increases of ≥2, ≥grade 3 CTCAE alanine transaminase, and ≥grade 2 bilirubin elevations were predictive. CONCLUSIONS: Increased CP score ≥2 strongly predicts for both OS and RILD-SS and should be reported in future studies along with transaminase elevations, which are also predictive of outcomes.",exclusion,Other intervention,,10.1016/j.prro.2017.10.013,,,,
random-journal.pdf,LivP236,NCT03895359,2019,,LIV.P:#2,Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) Versus TACE Plus Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) in Liver Carcinoma,"HCC tends to remain within the liver and, therefore, cure with preserved liver function is possible.4 Treatments with relatively high success rates include surgical resection and liver transplantation. Surgical resection results in 5-year survival rates of approximately 60%-70%.4 Liver transplantation can cure both the cancer and underlying liver disease with 4-year survival for HCC within the Milan criteria (single HCC <5 cm or ≤3 HCC <3 cm) at 70%-85% after transplantation.5 Unfortunately, most patients are not resectable due to the extent of disease. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has become the mainstay of treatment for unresectable HCC. 5,6 TACE is relatively safe due to the liver's unique vascular supply from the portal vein. HCC on the other hand, is supplied almost entirely by branches of the hepatic artery.7 In a randomized controlled trial for unresectable HCC not suitable for a curative intent, transarterial chemoembolisation or TACE were compared to conservative treatment.8 TACE induced objective responses (complete and partial response) that were sustained for at least 6 months in 35% of cases. Survival probabilities at 1 year and 2 years were 82% and 63% for TACE, significantly better than 63% and 27% obtained with conservative treatment. Overall survival at 1 and 2 years was also significantly better for the chemoembolization group 57% and 31% vs. 32% and 11%. However, many patients have large tumours and response rates to TACE decline rapidly with increasing size.9 TACE alone resulted in 2 year overall survivals of 42%, 0 and 0 for lesions 5-7cm, 8-10cm, and >10cm, respectively. Therefore, additional locally ablative treatments are being sought. In the same report, TACE plus radiation resulted in 2 year overall survivals of 63%, 50% and 17% for lesions 5-7cm, 8-10cm, and >10cm, respectively.9 External beam radiotherapy has long been considered to have a very limited role in the treatment of liver tumors. This has historically been because minimum dose required for local ablation exceeded the dose that would result in liver toxicity.10,11 The technical development of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), alone or in combination with TACE, renewed interest in radiation for HCC.12,13 For SBRT, advanced techniques are used to very accurately deliver a high total dose to the target in a small number of daily fractions while avoiding dose delivery to surrounding healthy structures. This research in HCC was done mainly by two groups, in Michigan and Stockholm, who demonstrated that the delivery of high doses of radiation to limited volumes of the liver had promising results in terms of local control and survival with acceptable toxicity.14,15 SBRT is offered as an ablative radical local treatment. In total as of 2015, eleven primary series reported on tumor response and survival of around 300 patients who have been treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy as primary therapy for HCC (Table A). The reported percentage of objective responses defined as complete and partial was ≥64% in 7 of 8 series. Median survival between 11.7 and 32 months has been observed. Toxicity, based on multiple case series trials, indicate that the treatment is considered safe. The most common CTC grade 3-4 toxicity was elevation of liver enzymes. 16-19 For unresectable cases, both TACE and SBRT have been used safely and with good efficacy as separate treatments. Particularly for larger lesions that are more commonly seen in London, the outcome remains suboptimal compared to surgery. Combined treatment case series have shown dramatic results (Table B), but there has not been any randomized trial to compare the value of combining the two modalities. Therefore, a clinical study comparing SBRT and SBRT+TACE will be significant as it addresses a common problem in one of the two most deadly cancers.",inclusion,,,,,,,

Radiation (RT) in a range of doses has been combined with TACE in several case cohort studies demonstrating safety and a dramatic improvement in survival. Clearly these trials are subject to bias due to non-randomized selection, possible lack of generalizability to Canadian patients, and heterogeneous patient populations. Objective: Therefore, there is a high priority need to investigate the addition of RT to TACE in a randomized fashion to determine if we can improve survival in this rapidly growing poor prognosis patient population that have no other options. Methodology: TACE eligible patients with HCC will be randomized to TACE alone or TACE plus radiation (TACERT). They cannot be eligible for standard treatments such as transplant and resection.

About 121 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study, from March 2008 to January 2010, in the Second Xiangya Hospital. Forty-six patients underwent TACE alone, 36 patients underwent γ-knife alone, and 39 were treated by γ-knife combined with TACE. Short-term effects, overall survival rates, adverse reactions, and survival times were compared between the 3 treatment groups.Short-term effects were observed in 41.3% of the TACE group, 33.3% of the γ-knife group, and 64.1% of the TACE combined γ-knife group (P = .020). Overall survival rates at 6,12, 18, and 24 months were 50%, 34.8%, 28.3%, and 21.7% for the TACE group, 36.1%, 30.6%, 16.7%, and 11.1% for γ-knife group, and 84.6%, 71.8%, 61.5%, and 30.8% for TACE combined γ-knife group, respectively. The differences in the overall survival rates at 6, 12, and 18 months between the 3 groups were statistically significant (P = 0), but the overall survival rates at 24 months in the 3 groups were not significantly different (P = .117). The median survival time was 7 months for the TACE group, 3 months for the γ-knife group, and 20 months for the TACE combined γ-knife group (P = 0). There were statistically significant differences (P = .010) of leukopenia between the 3 groups, and no statistically significant differences of (P > .05) thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, and liver function lesions.TACE combined with γ-knife for primary hepatocellular carcinoma is superior to TACE or γ-knife alone in short-term and long-term effects.

Increasing energy deposition in the tumor while at the same time maintaining the dose in healthy tissue remains a major challenge in radiation oncology that could be achieved by NBTXR3 (hafnium oxide nanoparticles) when activated by radiotherapy (RT). NBTXR3 augments energy dose deposit within tumor cells, increasing tumor cell death compared to RT alone, while sparing healthy tissues. Patients (pts) with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or liver metastasis (mets) may benefit from the mode of action of NBTXR3. A phase I/II clinical trial has been conducted to evaluate NBTXR3 activated by SBRT in these pts [NCT02721056]. Method(s): The Phase I used a 3+3 dose escalation scheme with 5 NBTXR3 dose levels: 10, 15, 22, 33, and 42% of baseline tumor volume. NBTXR3 was administered by intratumoral injection (ITI) followed by SBRT (45 Gy / 3 fractions / 5 to 7 days or 50 Gy / 5 fractions / 15 days). Primary endpoints were identification of the recommended Phase II Dose and early DLTs. Secondary endpoints included safety profile, liver function evaluated by Child-Pugh score (CPS), AST to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), and early efficacy by response rate (mRECIST/RECIST 1.1). Result(s): The dose escalation levels of 10, 15, 22 and 33% are completed (n = 17): 6 pts at 10% (2 SBRT doses tested due to organ constraints), 4 pts each at 15% and 22% (due to fiducial displacement and ITI shift) and 3 pts at 33%. No early DLT was observed and only one SAE (bile duct stenosis) related to NBTXR3 and RT occurred. CPS and APRI did not show clinically meaningful changes posttreatment and CT-scan showed no leakage of NBTXR3 into surrounding tissues. Best response for HCC (n = 8) were 5CR, 3PR and for mets (n = 6) the results were: 3 PR, 3SD. Conclusion(s): ITI of NBTXR3 is feasible, demonstrated a very good safety and tolerability profile up to the 33% dose level. Recruitment needs to be finalized at the 42% dose level. Based on early efficacy results NBTXR3 has the potential to address an unmet medical need in pts with unresectable primary or metastatic liver cancer.",exclusion,Other study,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2020.38.4_suppl.537,,,,

For early stage patients, ablative strategies are important potentially curative treatment options. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has emerged as a promising non-surgical ablative therapy, although it is technically demanding and its comparison with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) remains confined to a single institution retrospective review. We queried the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database to assess RFA and SBRT use in the US. We identified patients greater than 65 years old who were diagnosed from 2004-11 with AJCC stage I or II HCC and treated with RFA or SBRT as the initial treatment within 6 months of diagnosis. Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis. Factors associated with overall survival (OS) and 90-day hospital admission post-treatment were identified using propensity score (PS) adjusted multivariate analysis. 544 patients were identified, 499 treated with RFA and 45 SBRT. The mean Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was 0.98+/-1.24. Mean age was 74+/-5.5. Patients who received RFA were more likely to live in the West and have liver decompensation. Patients who received SBRT were more commonly treated in the Midwest (OR 1.30, p<0.001). After using PS matching there were 45 in each cohort. In these patients, mean overall survival (OS) was 1.96+/-2.46 and 1.62+/-1.25 yrs for RFA and SBRT, p=0.0048. However in the multivariate analysis SBRT treatment was not associated with survival (p=0.20). Overall survival in the propensity matched model was negatively impacted by treatment in the northeast US (HR: 2.77 95% CI: 1.0-7.66), residing in an urban setting (HR: 3.16 95% CI: 1.27-7.85), and decompensated cirrhosis (HR: 3.22 95% CI: 1.25-8.29.) 90 day hospitalization rates did not differ between treatments in the multivariate propensity adjused analysis.

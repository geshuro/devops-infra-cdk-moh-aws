Patients with oligometastatic disease could eventually be managed by treating all the active lesions with local therapy, i.e. either surgery or ablative stereotactic body radiotherapy. This study aims to assess the impact of [(18)F]Choline ([(18)F]FMCH) PET/CT and the use stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in patients (pts) with oligometastatic prostate cancer (PCa). METHODS: Twenty-nine pts with oligometastatic PCa (≤3 synchronous active lesions detected with [(18)F]FMCHPET/CT) were treated with repeated salvage SBRT until disease progression (development of > three active synchronous metastases). Primary endpoint was systemic therapy-free survival measured from the baseline [(18)F]FMCHPET/CT. RESULTS: A total of 45 lesions were treated with SBRT. After a median follow-up of 11.5 months (range 3-40 months), 20 pts were still in the study and did not receive any systemic therapy. Nine pts started systemic therapy, and the median time of the primary endpoint was 39.7 months (CI 12.20-62.14 months). No grade 3 or 4 toxicity was recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated salvage [(18)F]FMCHPET/CT-guided SBRT is well tolerated and could defer the beginning of systemic therapy in selected patients with oligometastatic PCa.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,10.1186/s13014-016-0586-x,ProP2,,

Radiotherapy is a widely used form of therapy that is used in half of all cancer patients. Advances in understanding the fundamentals of tumor and radiation biology, in medical physics and computer science as well as technical developments have continuously improved the effectiveness and healing success of radiotherapy. Patients benefit from new treatment concepts such as hypofractionated radiotherapy for breast and prostate cancer, leading to a reduction in the duration of treatment by several weeks. Selected patients with early stages of breast cancer can be treated with partial breast irradiation with focus on the tumor bed after breast conserving surgery increasing tolerability and comfort. High dose stereotactic radiotherapy over five to six sessions of radiation or only one fraction (radiosurgery) have expanded treatment options for common tumor entities leading to long-lasting tumor control resulting in improved survival and quality of life for those affected. In early lung cancer stereotactic radiotherapy is an alternative to primary tumor surgery. For patients with oligometastatic tumor disease stereotactic radiotherapy allows a curative approach by effectively treating metastases. In patients with brain metastases whole-brain irradiation is replaced by stereotactic irradiation of the individual metastases with fewer side effects. Recently, promising results for improved tumor control with the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy have been presented. Radioimmunotherapy represents a new therapy combination. However, final assessment of its efficacy and side effects profile is still missing. In order to gain therapeutic certainty, further prospective study data are necessary.",exclusion,review,Llegir per a informació general sobre RT,10.1024/0040-5930/a001086,ProP3,,

Radiation therapy is one of the reference analgesic treatments. The objective of this study was to compare the current practices of a French radiotherapy department for the treatment of uncomplicated bone metastases with data from the literature in order to improve and optimize the management of patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective monocentric study of patients who underwent palliative irradiation of uncomplicated bone metastases was performed. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients had 116 treatments of uncomplicated bone metastases between January 2014 and December 2015, including 44 men (48%) and 47 women (52%) with an average age of 63years (25-88years). Primary tumours most commonly found were breast cancer (35%), lung cancer (16%) and prostate cancer (12%). The regimens used were in 29% of cases 30Gy in ten fractions (group 30Gy), in 21% of cases 20Gy in five fractions (group 20Gy), in 22% of cases 8Gy in one fraction (group 8Gy) and in 28% of cases 23.31Gy in three fractions of stereotactic body irradiation (stereotactic group). The general condition of the patient (P<0.001), pain score and analgesic (P<0.001), oligometastatic profile (P=0.003) and practitioner experience (P<0.001) were factors influencing the choice of the regimen irradiation. Age (P=0.46), sex (P=0.14), anticancer treatments (P=0.56), concomitant hospitalization (P=0.14) and the distance between the radiotherapy centre and home (P=0.87) did not influence the decision significantly. A total of three cases of spinal compression and one case of post-therapeutic fracture were observed, occurring between one and 128days and 577days after irradiation, respectively. Eight percent of all irradiated metastases were reirradiated with a delay ranging between 13 and 434days after the first irradiation. The re-irradiation rate was significantly higher after 8Gy (P=0.02). The rate of death was significantly lower in the stereotactic arm (P<0.001) and overall survival was significantly greater in the stereotactic arm (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: This study showed that patients' analysed was comparable to the population of different studies. Predictive factors for the choice of the treatment regimen were identified. Non-fractionnated therapy was underutilised while stereotactic treatment was increasingly prescribed, showing an evolution in the management of patients.",exclusion,Not dealing with the intervention of interest (dealing with bone metastasis),,10.1016/j.canrad.2017.09.006,ProP4,,

To investigate the accuracy of seeds implantation according preplan guided by 3D print template. Methods: A total of 21 cases of patient with 27 lesions underwent (125)I seeds implantation from January 2015 to May 2018 in Hebei General Hospital were analyzed retrospectively. In which, ten lesions underwent seeds implantation guided by 3D print template (template group) and 17 lesions underwent free-hand traditional implantation (traditional group). All patients had been fixed as the position of operation and then performed CT scan. After preplan was designed, the 3D templates were printed in template group. Postplan was performed after the operation.The dose volume histogram, D90 was calculated. The D90 pre and post operation were collected and compared in each group. The difference of D90 and the percentage difference of D90 between pre and post operation were calculated by the formula D90d=D90post-D90pre, D90d%=(D90post-D90pre)/D90pre_100%, and compared the difference between two groups. Results: The mean D90 pre and post operation in template group were (92±26) and (93±27) Gy respectively, t=-0.749, P=0.473. The mean D90 pre and post operation in traditional group were (104±29) and (104±26) Gy respectively, t=-0.139, P=0.891.

Prostate cancer bone metastases are largely sclerotic; RECIST response assessment is not valid and visual response assessment using conventional bone scan and CT can be unreliable (1). 18F-NaF-PET-CT images osteoblastic activity with superior sensitivity and resolution compared to conventional bone scintigraphy whilst enabling accurate uptake quantification (2). We report on 18FNaF uptake before and after stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) to prostate cancer bony metastases. Methods and Materials: All patients with bony metastases enrolled in the POPSTAR trial received an 18F-NaF-PET-CT prior to and 6 months post-SABR. All patients received a single 20 Gy fraction to one or more lesions with 3D-conformal or intensity modulated techniques. The gross tumour volume (GTV) was contoured using the 18F-NaF-PET-CT and planning CT, and a 5 mm planning target volume (PTV) margin was applied to non-spine lesions. Spine clinical target volumes were derived using the International Spinal Radiosurgery Consortium guidelines and a 3 mm PTV margin applied. The 18F-NaF-PET-CT uptake was measured in the GTV, and non-GTV bone receiving 2-24 Gy in 2 Gy increments. Result(s): Twenty-one patients with 33 bony metastases were included with a mean st. dev. 7.4 1.0 months follow-up 18FNaF-PET-CT scan. The SUVmean of normal, un-irradiated bone was consistent between pre and post-treatment scans, with a mean st. dev. ratio, post/pre of 0.98 0.08. Reduction in GTV SUVmax was observed in 30/33 lesions. Of the three lesions with increased SUVmax, two were from the same patient who had local progression in one lesion. A second patient with local progression exhibited a 50% decrease in tumour SUVmax. No loss in SUVmean was observed in non-tumour bone receiving <10 Gy; above 10 Gy uptake decreased with increasing radiotherapy dose to a mean S.E.M loss of 24 6% for non-tumour bone receiving 24 Gy. Conclusion(s): 18F-NaF-PET-CT detected response in 80% of lesions treated with single fraction SABR.

random-journal.pdf,ProM9,"Y., Kuang",2016,English,#1;pro.m,18F-sodium fluoride PET/CT-guided dose escalation in stereotactic body radiotherapy for spine oligometastases from prostate cancer,"Purpose: Recent clinical evidence has shown that SBRT using high dose with either a single fraction or a limited number of fractions can lead to excellent pain control as well as local tumor control in patients with spine oligometastases. However, as a dose limiting factor, proximity to spinal cord often precludes SBRT delivering the full prescription dose (PD) and/or escalating dose to the planning target volume (PTV) of spine oligometastases, thus compromising the therapeutic ratio. To investigate the technical feasibility of SBRT dose painting using 18F-NaF positron emission tomography (PET) scans guidance in patients with spine oligometastases from prostate cancer. Method(s): As a proof of concept, six patients with 15 spine oligometastatic lesions from prostate cancer who had 18F-NaF PET/CT scan prior to treatment were retrospectively included. GTVreg was delineated according to the regular tumor boundary shown on PET and/or CT images; and GTVMATV was contoured based on a net metabolically active tumor volume (MATV) defined by 60% of the SUVmax values on 18F- NaF PET images. The PTVs (PTVreg and PTVMATV ) were defined as respective GTVs (plus involved entire vertebral body for PTVreg ) with a 3-mm isotropic expansion margin. Three 1-fraction SBRT plans using VMAT technique along with 10 MV FFF beams (Plan24Gy , Plan24-27Gy , and Plan24-30Gy ) were generated for each patient. All plans included a dose of 24 Gy prescribed to PTVreg . The Plan24-27Gy and Plan24-30Gy also included a simultaneous boost dose of 27 Gy or 30 Gy prescribed to the PTVMATV , respectively. The feasibility of 18F-NaF PET-guided SBRT dose escalation was evaluated by its ability to achieve the prescription dose objectives while adhering to organ-at-risk (OAR) dose constraints. The normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP) calculated by radiological models were also compared between the plans. Result(s): In all 33 SBRT plans generated, the planning objectives and dose constraints were met without exception. Plan24-27Gy and Plan24-30Gy had a significantly higher dose in PTVMATV than Plan24 (p < 0.05), respectively, while maintaining a similar OAR sparing profile and NTCP values. Conclusion(s): The strategy of delivering differential doses using SBRT with a simultaneous integrated dose boost to MATV offers the option of irradiating host facilitating cells simultaneously with the cancer cells in the tumor ecosystem. Using VMAT with FFF beams to incorporate a simultaneous 18F-NaF PET-guided radiation boost dose up to 30 Gy into a SBRT plan is technically feasible. The relationship between local control and normal tissue toxicity in SBRT dose painting should be validated in clinical trials.",exclusion,Other tumor treated (spinal),,http://dx.doi.org/10.1158/1538-7445.AM2016-3974,,,

We present a prospective Phase II trial with 90% treated in community facilities. Method(s): 14 institutions enrolled 259 patients - 112 low-risk; 147 intermediate-risk. The regimen emulated a high-dose rate brachytherapy (HDR) regimen - 38 Gy/4 fractions delivered by robotic SBRT. Androgen deprivation therapy was not allowed. HDR-like heterogeneous prostate dosing was used (Dmax >57 Gy). Toxicities were assessed by CTCAE v3.0 and quality of life assessed by Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC). Biochemical recurrence was defined by Phoenix criteria. Result(s): Median follow-up is 5 years. 5-yr Grade 2 GU toxicity was 13.7% and GI toxicity 4.5%, with Grade 3 rates of 3% (GU) and 0% (GI) (one Gd 4 GU event). 5-yr median PSA was 0.1 ng/mL with further subsequent decrease (7 y = 0.035 ng/mL). 5-yr biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) = 100% for low-risk and 88.5% for int-risk. 6 patients developed distant metastasis and one died of disease. Median EPIC GU obstruction and GI scores were similar at baseline vs. 5 years. 2% of patients had baseline GU incontinence requiring pad use vs 10% at 5 yrs. Of baseline potent men, 46% remained so at 5 yrs (66.7% for those age <=65 vs. 37.1% age >65 at treatment).

Exact knowledge of the relapse location may result in changes of both therapy concept and TNM stage. To gain data for this approach, we evaluated PC patients receiving 68Ga-PSMA-PET imaging before salvage radiotherapy (RT). Purpose/Objective(s): In this study, 100 patients with biochemical failure after RP +/-prior RT were evaluated who underwent 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT or PET/MRI. All received salvage RT in our department. We analyzed TNM staging changes due to 68Ga-PSMA-PET imaging and its influence on RT planning and treatment. Result(s): Median age was 64 years (range = 46-79 years). Uptake in 68Ga-PSMA-PET indicative for tumor recurrence was found in 76% of the patients with biochemical recurrent PC. Median PSA level was 1.0 ng/mL (range = 0.12-14.7 ng/mL). Of these, 80% showed no morphological correlate in the corresponding CT or MRI. Forty-three percent of all patients experienced a change in TNM stage due to 68Ga-PSMA-PET imaging. Patients had changes from Tx to rcT+ (28%), 12% from pN0 to rcN1, 1% from pN0/cM0 to rcM1a, and 8% from cM0 to rcM1b. Due to the additional knowledge of 68Ga-PSMA-PET imaging, initial planned RT planning was adapted in 59% of all cases. An additional simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to the prostate bed or lymph nodes was given to 32% and 63%, respectively. Ten patients received stereotactic body RT (SBRT) to single bone metastases. Conclusion(s): The 68Ga-PSMA-PET imaging showed a high clinical impact on staging and RT management in patients with biochemically recurrent PC, even at low serum PSA levels.

We isolated the portfolio of trials that investigate the primary immunomodulatory properties of RT and examined recent trends in clinical trials that combine immunotherapy and RT (ITRT). Method(s): We queried clinicaltrials.gov for trials initiated since 2002 using both radiation and immunotherapy as mandated interventions. We designated the trials that examine the specific aspects of RT or its abscopal properties as ""Primary RT Immunomodulation"" trials. Chi-squared analysis determined differences between primary RT immunomodulation trials and those that incorporate RT as a secondary intervention. Joinpoint regression modeling determined the rate of change of the introduction of new trials over time. Result(s): One hundred and ninety trials met inclusion criteria. Targeted immunostimulatory agents, including checkpoint inhibitors, were the most common immunotherapy (n = 79 [41.6%]). Sixty-six (34.7%) trials included RT as the primary intervention, with 50 (75.6%) of these utilizing stereotactic body radiation (SBRT). All ITRT trials increased at a rate of 14.8% per year. Primary RT immunomodulation trials increased at a rate of 26.8% per year. Primary RT immunomodulation trials were more likely to utilize targeted immunostimulatory agents (p < 0.01), and SBRT (p < 0.01), and more likely to involve metastatic sites (p < 0.01). The number of ITRT studies increased drastically in the latest two years of the study. Conclusion(s): The number of new ITRT clinical trials is increasing rapidly.

Clearly novel combinations are needed and a deeper understanding of immune resistance. Using a multi-arm, multi-stage platform design, the PORTER study will adaptively test multiple immunotherapeutic combinations to activate the innate and adaptive immune systems. Coupled with deep immune biomarker profiling, this design will enable rapid insights into the immune responses for each combination, providing data for potential larger definitive trials, while generating hypotheses for new cohorts. Methods PORTER is an open-label, non-randomized, exploratory platform study designed to assess the safety and antitumor activity of multiple immunotherapy combinations in participants with mCRPC who have received prior secondary androgen inhibition therapy. Each cohort has a two-stage design (initial n = 15, expansion n = 15) with a decision to expand based on the safety, clinical activity, and biomarker results observed in the initial stage. Cohort A is open and recruiting, testing the combination of bempegaldesleukin (?BEMPEG?, NKTR-214; a CD-122 preferential IL-2 pathway agonist) with nivolumab (PD-1 inhibitor), postulating that this will increase PD-L1 expression, intratumoral T and NK cells, and induce an IFN gamma signature.

Methods and Materials: Patients with localized spine metastases free from VCF associated with loss of vertebral height with a pain score >=4 using the visual analog scale were enrolled. Spine SABR was performed with 20 Gy delivered to the gross disease and 14 Gy to the contiguous bone marrow in a single fraction. Immediate, prophylactic vertebroplasty was performed within 1 month after spine SABR. The primary endpoint was pain response at 3 months compared to the historical control with external beam radiation therapy from Radiation Therapy Oncology Group study 9714. Secondary endpoints included pain response at 1 month, duration of pain response, vertebroplasty rate, VCF rate, local control, and overall survival. Result(s): Thirty-five patients were enrolled, of whom 29 were deemed eligible and underwent single-fraction spine SABR. Twenty-three of these patients subsequently underwent prophylactic vertebroplasty. The 3-month pain response was significantly improved compared to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group study 9714: 95% versus 51% (P <.0001). The local control with a median follow-up of 9.6 months was 92%. The freedom from VCF was 90% at 1 year. Spine SABR was well tolerated with no grade 2 or higher toxicities. A single patient with disease extending from the vertebral body into the spinal canal developed vertebroplasty-related myelopathy, which was corrected with surgery. Conclusion(s): Single-fraction SABR immediately followed by prophylactic vertebroplasty improves pain response compared with conventional radiation therapy while providing long-term pain control and structural stability of the treated spine. Vertebroplasty is well tolerated as a prophylactic measure in patients without loss of vertebral height after spine SABR. Pain response and VCF rates are similar to patients undergoing SABR alone. Thus, patients who would benefit most from the addition of vertebroplasty need to be further identified.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",exclusion,Not dealing with the intervention of interest (dealing with spine metastasis),,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.01.072,ProP21,,

We conducted a clinical trial of stereotactic hypofractionated radiation therapy delivered in once-weekly fractions on patients with all-risk non-metastatic disease to test feasibility, acute toxicities and patient-reported outcomes. Material(s) and Method(s): In this phase I/II study, 30 patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma, any Gleason score, T1-4N0 and prostate-specific antigen <=60 ng/ml were treated with volumetric intensity modulated arc radiation therapy to a dose of 35 Gy in five fractions delivered once weekly. Patients with high-risk disease also received elective nodal irradiation to a dose of 25 Gy in five fractions simultaneously. Androgen deprivation was offered to intermediate- and high-risk patients. The primary outcome was acute toxicity. Secondary outcome measures included biochemical control and late toxicity. Patient-reported outcomes were measured using the International Prostate Symptom Score and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (QLQ). Result(s): All 30 patients completed treatment per-protocol. Most patients had T3 (60%) and Gleason 7 (50%) tumours. The median prostate-specific antigen was 17 ng/ml. High-risk disease was present in 20 patients (66.7%). There was a low incidence of acute toxicities (grade 2 + urinary 3.3%, grade 2 rectal 0%). Within the EORTC QLQ framework, only the urinary symptom score showed a clinically meaningful worsening from a mean of 20/100 at baseline to 34/100 at the end of treatment (P < 0.001), but reduced to 24/100 at 6 months (P = 0.08). With a median follow-up of 41.5 months, two patients each reported grade 2 late urinary and rectal toxicity. The 3- and 4-year biochemical control rates were 96.7 and 87.9%, respectively.

We present the results of FASTR-2, which used a lower dose to the prostate (35 Gy vs 40 Gy), smaller posterior PTV margin (4 mm vs 5 mm) and omitted nodal radiation to lower the volumes of rectum receiving high and intermediate doses compared with FASTR. Gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicities at baseline, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year and biochemical control rates are presented. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligibility included high-risk prostate cancer (cT3/4, prostate-specific antigen >20 or Gleason Score ≥8), age ≥70 or refused standard treatment, and no evidence of metastatic disease. Patients received 18 months of androgen deprivation therapy starting 2 months before radiation. Clinical target volume was defined as prostate plus proximal 1-cm seminal vesicles. PTV was a nonuniform expansion around clinical target volume (4 mm posteriorly, 5 mm in all other directions). Volumetric arc therapy was used for treatment delivery (35 Gy delivered in 5 weekly fractions of 7 Gy each), and cone beam computed tomography with soft tissue matching (no fiducial placement) was used for daily image guidance. Toxicity was assessed at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year according to Common Toxicity Criteria. RESULTS: In the study, 30 patients were enrolled in FASTR-2 between 2015 and 2017. Two patients were withdrawn owing to ineligibility after enrollment. One patient (3.7%) reported grade 2 GI toxicity at 6 weeks. There was no reported grade ≥2 GI toxicity at 6 months or 1 year. There were no reported episodes of rectal bleeding. Four patients (14.8%), 5 patients (17.9%), and 5 patients (21.7%) reported grade 2 GU toxicity at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year, respectively. There were no reported cases of grade ≥3 GU toxicity. The most common toxicities were nocturia and urinary frequency or urgency. CONCLUSIONS: FASTR-2 was more tolerable than FASTR, with no grade ≥3 toxicities reported, in keeping with expectations based on our previous FASTR analysis. Long-term follow-up is necessary to ensure disease control and toxicity outcomes are comparable to conventional high-risk treatment paradigms.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,10.1016/j.adro.2019.07.007,,,

Historically, salvage HDR has, but recently, advances in imaging have allowed for improved intraprostatic recurrence localization. We hypothesized that by using diagnostic multiparametric MRI and fluciclovine PET with MRI-based treatment planning, the salvage HDR therapeutic ratio could be improved by targeting the focal lesion in a single fraction. The FSHARP trial is currently studying this approach and we report the initial dosimetry and preliminary experience of patients enrolled on this study. Materials/Methods: FSHARP (NCT0331297) is a Phase I/II trial of salvage focal single fraction HDR for radiorecurrent prostate cancer in patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer after any form of definitive radiotherapy. The primary endpoint is 3-month RT-related CTCAE v4.03 grade >=3 genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity, with an initial 7 patient safety lead-in. Eligibility criteria include: initial diagnosis of cT1-T3a N0 M0 prostate adenocarcinoma, no evidence of metastases, and biopsy-proven local recurrence. All patients require a multiparametric MRI and biopsy of any target lesions. Patients undergo transrectal ultrasound-guided catheter placement followed by MRI-based treatment planning and HDR treatment. The planning target volume (PTV) is a 0-5 mm expansion around the gross tumor volume (GTV) avoiding surrounding critical structures. The prescription is to the periphery with the highest dose possible up to 30 Gy while not violating critical structure constraints and prioritizing GTV > PTV coverage. We performed a descriptive analysis of patient characteristics, dosimetry, and the acute EPIC-26 patient-reported quality of life of patients currently enrolled on the trial. Result(s): 11 of a planned 24 patients have been treated on trial and the initial safety lead-in has been completed, with enrollment ongoing. Prior definitive treatment included external beam radiotherapy (n=8), low dose rate brachytherapy (n=2), and stereotactic body radiotherapy (n=1), with a median of 67 months from the completion of prior radiotherapy. Median pre-salvage PSA was 6.3 (range: 2.6-13.5). The median number of HDR catheters was 17 (range: 13-22), and the median prescribed peripheral dose was 19 Gy (19-22). Median GTV was 5.4 cc (2.01-44.72). Median PTV was 23.7 cc (8.78-76.69). Median GTV D90 was 21.3 Gy (17.13-35.91), PTV D90 was 19.6 Gy (16.3-23.9) Conclusion(s): Accrual to the FSHARP trial is ongoing. Future studies will correlate dosimetric findings with clinical outcomes.

Our purpose was to compare toxicity with increasingly hypofractionated EBRT in combination with a single 15 Gy HDR boost for men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Methods and Materials: Forty-two men were enrolled on this phase IB clinical trial to one of three EBRT dose cohorts: 10 fractions, seven fractions, or five fractions. Patients were followed prospectively for safety, efficacy, and health-related quality of life (Expanded Prostate Index Composite). Efficacy was assessed biochemically using the Phoenix definition. Result(s): With a median follow up of 36 months, the biochemical disease-free survival was 95.5%. One man developed metastatic disease at 5 years. There was no significant minimally important difference in EPIC PRO for either urinary, bowel, or sexual domains. There was one acute Grade 3 GI and GU toxicity, but no late Grade 3 GU or GI toxicities. Conclusion(s): Fifteen gray HDR brachytherapy followed by a five fraction SBRT approach results in high disease control rates and low toxicity similar to previously reported HDR protocols with significant improvement in patient convenience and resource savings. While mature results with longer follow up are awaited, this treatment approach may be considered a safe and effective option for men with intermediate-risk disease.Copyright © 2020 American Brachytherapy Society",exclusion,Not the right comparator,Compara diferents dosis de SBRT combinades amb Brachytherapy,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brachy.2020.02.008,,,

Importantly, biomarkers to determine patients who benefit most from complete ablation are unknown. We hypothesize that stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR) will improve oncologic outcomes in men with OMPC. Method(s): In this phase II randomized trial, men with recurrent hormone-sensitive OMPC (1 -3 radiation fields) were stratified by primary management (radiotherapy vs surgery), PSA doubling time, and prior androgen deprivation therapy and randomized 2:1 to SABR or observation (OBS). The primary endpoint was progression at 6 months by PSA (> 25% increase and > nadir + 2 ng/mL), conventional imaging (RECIST 1.1 criteria or new lesion on bone scan), or symptomatic decline. Tissue, liquid and imaging correlatives were analyzed as biomarkers. Result(s): From 5/2016-3/2018, 54 patients were randomized. Progression at six months occurred in 19% of SABR patients and 61% of observation patients [p=0.005]. SABR improved median PFS (not reached vs 5.8 months, HR 0.30, p = 0.0023). Total consolidation of PSMA radiotracer-avid disease decreased the risk of new lesions at six months (16% vs 63% p = 0.006). No toxicity > grade 3 was observed. T-cell receptor sequencing identified increased clonotypic expansion (p = 0.03) following SABR and correlation between baseline clonality and progression with SABR only. Analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and germline mutations identified a mutation profile that was associated with benefit from SABR. Conclusion(s): SABR for OMPC improves outcomes and is enhanced by total consolidation of disease identified by PSMA-targeted PET. SABR induces a systemic immune response, and baseline immune phenotype and tumor mutation status may predict the benefit from SABR. These results underline the importance of prospective randomized investigation of the oligometastatic state with integrated imaging and biological correlates.",inclusion,,Potser el follow-up no és prou llarg i nombre de participants és petit.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2020.38.6_suppl.116,ProP26,,Conference abstract

The primary clinical endpoint will be progression at 6 months from randomization with the hypothesis that SABR to all metastases will forestall progression by disrupting the metastatic process. Secondary clinical endpoints will include local control at 6 months post-SABR, toxicity and quality of life, and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-free survival (ADT-FS). Further fundamental analysis of the oligometastatic state with be achieved through correlation with investigational (18)F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging and measurement of circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA, and circulating T-cell receptor repertoires, facilitating an unprecedented opportunity to characterize, in isolation, the effects of SABR on the dynamics of and immunologic response to oligometastatic disease. METHODS/DESIGN: Patients will be randomized 2:1 to SABR or observation with minimization to balance assignment by primary intervention, prior hormonal therapy, and PSA doubling time. Progression after 6 months will be compared using Fisher's exact test. Hazard ratios and Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression free survival (PFS), ADT free survival (ADT-FS), time to locoregional progression (TTLP) and time to distant progression (TTDP) will be calculated based on an intention-to-treat. Local control will be assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. Withdrawal from the study prior to 6 months will be counted as progression. Adverse events will be summarized by type and grade. Quality of life pre- and post- SABR will be measured by Brief Pain Inventory. DISCUSSION: The ORIOLE trial is the first randomized, non-blinded Phase II interventional study in the North America evaluating the safety and efficacy of SABR in oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.

Patients will be stratified by clinical characteristics and randomized 2:1 to SBRT or observation. The primary clinical endpoint is progression at 6 months defined by PSA increase, radiologic or clinical evidence, ADT initiation, or death from any cause. Secondary endpoints include local control at 6 months, SBRT-associated toxicity and quality of life, and ADT-free survival. Imaging and laboratory correlates will characterize, in isolation, the effects of SBRT on oligometastatic disease. Method(s): Eligible patients are hormone-sensitive, have undergone prior definitive treatment and recurred with 1-3 asymptomatic bone or soft tissue metastases diagnosed within 6 months, PSA doubling time (PSADT) < 15 months, ECOG performance status 2, and normal organ and marrow function. Minimization will be used to balance assignment by primary intervention, prior ADT, and PSADT. Accrual of 54 patients provides 85% power to detect a decrease in progression rate from 80% to 40% with type I error = 0.05 using one-sided Fisher's exact test. Hazard ratios and Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression free survival, ADT free survival, and time to locoregional and distant progression will be calculated based on intention-to-treat. Local control will be assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria. Withdrawal prior to 6 months will be counted as progression. Adverse events will be summarized and quality of life pre- and post-SBRT will be measured by Brief Pain Inventory. The investigational targeted imaging agent F-DCFPyL will be compared to bone scan and CT for identifying oligometastases before SBRT and monitoring disease response following SBRT. Biological alterations induced by SBRT will be investigated using circulating tumor cell analysis, deep sequencing of circulating tumor DNA, and T-cell repertoire profiling.

random-journal.pdf,ProM24,"H., Hasan",2020,eng,pro.m:#2,A phase II randomized trial of RAdium-223 dichloride and SABR Versus SABR for oligomEtastatic prostate caNcerS (RAVENS),"Background: Metastasis directed therapy (MDT) for patients with oligometastatic disease is associated with improvements in progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to systemic therapy alone. Additionally, within a prostate-cancer-specific cohort, MDT is able to forestall initiation of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with hormone-sensitive, oligometastatic prostate cancer (HSOPCa) compared to observation. While MDT appears to be safe and effective in HSOPCa, a large percentage of men will eventually have disease recurrence. Patterns of failure in HSOPCa demonstrate patients tend to have recurrence in the bone following MDT, raising the question of sub-clinically-apparent osseous disease. Radium-223 dichloride is a radiopharmaceutical with structural similarity to calcium, allowing it to be taken up by bone where it emits alpha particles, and therefore might have utility in the treatment of micrometastatic osseous disease. Therefore, the primary goal of the phase II RAVENS trial is to evaluate the efficacy of MDT + radium-223 dichloride in prolonging progression free survival in men with HSOPCa. Method(s): Patients with HSOPCa and 3 or less metastases with at least 1 bone metastasis will be randomized 1:1 to stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR, also known as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)) alone vs SABR + radium-223 dichloride with a minimization algorithm to balance assignment by institution, primary intervention, prior hormonal therapy, and PSA doubling time. SABR is delivered in one to five fractions and patients in the SABR + radium-223 dichloride arm will receive six infusions of radium-223 dichloride at four-week intervals. The primary end point is progression free survival. The secondary clinical endpoints include toxicity and quality of life assessments, local control at 12 months, locoregional progression, time to distant progression, time to new metastasis, and duration of response. Discussion(s): The RAVENS trial will be the first described phase II, non-blinded, randomized study to compare SABR +/- radium-223 dichloride in patients with HSOPCa and 3 or less metastases with at least one bone metastasis. The primary hypothesis is that SABR + radium-223 dichloride will increase median progression-free survival from 10 months in the SABR arm to 20 months in the SABR + radium-223 dichloride arm.

random-journal.pdf,ProM25,"I., Porter",2020,English,pro.m,"A phase II, open-label study of durvalumab in combination with stereotactic body radiotherapy in androgen-intact patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer","Background: With the introduction of Ga68-PSMA PET, a new cohort of androgen-intact men with oligometastatic prostate cancer (PCa) recurrence has been identified. These men have normal traditional imaging and a disease-free interval usually measured in years from their definitive treatment. Recent data supports the use of metastasis-directed stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in oligometastatic PCa. Based on our institutional data in 57 patients treated with SBRT alone in the PSMA era, the median PSA progression free survival (PFS) is 11 months. Despite 100% local control, 80% relapsed by 18 months. Improving the PFS for these men is an important clinical need. Achieving this without the introduction of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) will likely improve quality of life and minimise the adverse consequences of androgen deprivation. Radiotherapy results in cell stress and release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) with activation of antigen presenting cells. This stimulates a tumour antigen specific T-cell response and abscopal effect which can be heightened with PD-(L)1 inhibition. Most PD-(L)1 inhibition trials in PCa are in men with a high burden of castrate resistant disease. However, data suggests the castrate state can impair host anti-tumour immune response. PD-(L)1 inhibition combined with SBRT in androgen-intact men may result in improved PFS compared with our historical cohort treated with SBRT alone. Method(s): This is a non-randomized, open label, phase II study of durvalumab (1500 mg IV every 4 weeks) starting 1 month prior to SBRT in men with recurrent PCa not immediately requiring ADT and with Ga68-PSMA PET detected oligometastasis. SBRT will be delivered with 30Gy/3# to lymph nodes or 24Gy/2# to bone metastasis. Durvalumab will be continued to a maximum of 12 months. Primary outcomes will be freedom from biochemical failure and toxicity.

The present randomized phase II study aimed to compare 2 SSRS schedules to determine which results the lowest rate of grade 3 or higher protocol-specified adverse events at 4 months. Materials/Methods: Patients with biopsy-proven non-hematogenous malignancy and limited un-irradiated spine metastases not requiring upfront spine surgery were eligible. Patients were randomized to receive either 16 Gy in 1 fraction or 24 Gy in 3 fractions on every other day. This study was designed to detect a protocol-specified adverse event rate > 20% at a 10% significance level (1-sided) and 90% power. Secondary analysis included time to treatment failure, which was defined as presence of grade 3 or higher adverse events or unequivocal local progression of treated spine(s) indicative of re-irradiation or surgical intervention. Designating the preferable of the 2 schedules was based on rules of protocol-specified adverse events and treatment failure rate for each arm. Result(s): Between November 2015 and October 2018, 50 patients (pts) were enrolled for SSRS to 75 metastatic spinal lesions, including 41 lung cancer, 2 breast cancer, 2 head and neck cancer, 2 liver cancer, 2 prostate cancer, and 1 colon cancer. The median age was 62 years old (range 36-79). There were 1 cervical, 41 thoracic, 31 lumbar, and 2 sacral sites for SSRS. Twenty-six patients were randomized to the single-fraction (SF) arm, and 24 patients were randomized to the multi-fraction (MF) arm. The median follow-up time was 11.73 months (range 0.67-39 months). At 4 months, none of the 25 evaluable patients in the SF arm experienced any protocol-specified grade 3 or higher toxicity, but 1 out of the 21 evaluable patients in the MF arm underwent surgical intervention due to progressive compression fracture. During longer follow-up, 2 patients in the SF arm and five additional patients in the MF arm developed treatment failure. The median time to treatment failure was 13.5 months for SF arm, and 8 months for MF arm. The one-year treatment failure rate was significantly worse in the MF arm (SF 5.6% versus MF 14.3%, p=0.04). Conclusion(s): Both SF and MF SSRS seem safe and the SF arm has met its primary endpoint. The interim analysis suggests 16 Gy in single fraction might be the preferable SSRS schedule and warrants longer follow-up as well as further investigation.Copyright © 2019",exclusion,Other tumor treated (spinal),,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.06.477,ProP31,,

While most studies allowed for metastases from multiple primary disease sites (n = 22, 34%), the most common was prostate (n = 13, 15%), followed by breast, gastrointestinal, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and renal (n = 6, 9% each). In studies with a solitary target site, the most common was liver (n = 6, 9%) followed by lung (n = 3, 5%). The most common primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) (n = 20, 31%) and toxicity (n = 10, 16%). A combined strategy of systemic therapy and SABR was an emerging theme (n = 23, 36%), with more recent studies specifically evaluating SABR and immunotherapy (n = 9, 14%). Conclusion(s): The safety and efficacy of SABR as oligometastasis-directed treatment is increasingly being evaluated within prospective clinical trials. These data are awaited to compliment the abundance of existing observational studies and to guide clinical decision-making.Copyright © 2019 Al-Shafa, Arifin, Rodrigues, Palma and Louie.

Reported regimens differ in time, dose, and fractionation. We report an update of a multicentre, Canadian randomized phase II study to investigate the impact of overall treatment time on efficacy, PSA kinetics and late toxicity. The quality of life data has been published previously. Materials/Methods: Men with cT1-2b (no MRI staging used), Gleason <=7, and PSA <= 20 ng/mL prostate cancer were randomized 1:1 to 40 Gy in 5 fractions delivered every other day (11 days) vs. once per week (29 days) using gantry-based SABR and gold-seed based image guidance. Late toxicity (>= 6mo) was graded by RTOG criteria; biochemical failure (BF) was defined by nadir >= 2 ng/ml. Cumulative incidence of BF, use of salvage therapies, late GI and GU toxicities were calculated. PSA nadir, time to PSA nadir, PSA response rate at 4 years (4yPSARR), overall survival (OS), cause specific survival (CSS) and metastases-free survival (MFS) are also presented. Result(s): A total of 152 men (13%, 58%, 29% with low, favorable intermediate and unfavorable intermediate prostate cancer) from 3 centres were randomized (77 to 11d arm; 75 to 29d arm); median follow-up was 62 months. Results are described for 11d vs. 29d. Of baseline characteristics, only median IPSS was different: 4 vs 7 (p=0.02). 5% and 4% used short-term androgen deprivation. There were 1 (1.3%) vs 3 (2.7%) late grade 3+ GI toxicities (p=0.36) and 5 (6.7%) vs 2 (2.7%) late grade 3 GU toxicities (p=0.44). Median PSA nadir was 0.1 ng/ml in both arms (median time to nadir 54mo). 4yPSARR were 76 vs 82% (p=0.42). 2 and 5 patients had BF (5-year failure rate 3.0 vs 7.2%, p=0.22); 0 and 4 patients received salvage therapy (p=0.04). 5-year OS and CSS was 95.8% and 98.6% with no difference between arms (p=0.49, p=0.15). 0 vs 3 patients developed metastases; 5-year MFS 100% vs 95.8% (p=0.08) T. Conclusion(s): Prostate SABR was well tolerated and effective in the medium term. There were no differences observed in toxicities, BF, PSA kinetics or survival outcomes between the 11 and 29 day regimens.

We report an update of a multicentre, Canadian randomized phase II study to investigate the impact of overall treatment time on quality of life (QOL), efficacy, and toxicity. METHODS: Men with intermediate risk prostate cancer were randomized to 40 Gy in 5 fractions delivered every other day (EOD) versus once per week (QW). Primary outcome was proportion of patients experiencing a minimally clinically important change (MCIC) in acute bowel QOL using EPIC. Secondary outcomes were toxicity, biochemical failure (BF), other QOL domains, and the rate of salvage therapy. FINDINGS: 152 men from 3 centers were randomized; the median follow-up was 62 months. Results are described for EOD versus QW. Acute bowel and urinary QOL was reported previously. Late changes in QOL were not significantly different between the two arms. There were 1 (1.3%) vs 3 (2.7%) late grade 3 + GI toxicities (p = 0.36) and 5 (6.7%) vs 2 (2.7%) late grade 3 GU toxicities (p = 0.44). Two and 5 patients had BF (5-year failure rate 3.0 vs 7.2%, p = 0.22); 0 and 4 patients received salvage therapy (p = 0.04). 5-Year OS and CSS was 95.8% and 98.6% with no difference between arms (p = 0.49, p = 0.15). 3 patients in the QW arm developed metastases. INTERPRETATION: Although we previously reported that weekly prostate SABR had better bowel and urinary QOL compared to EOD, the updated results show no difference in late toxicity, QOL, BF, or PSA kinetics. Patients should be counseled that QW SABR reduces short-term toxicity compared to QW SABR.",exclusion,Not the right comparator,Compara 2 groups amb SBRT aplicat amb diferent freqüència,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2020.04.039,ProP36,,

Method(s):Within the context of a prospective SBRT trial for oligometastases (NCT03486431), 54 bone and lymph node oligometastases, all detected on PSMA-PET/ CT, were irradiated in 40 prostate cancer patients between July 2017 and December 2018. Of these patients, 35 had hormone-sensitive and 5 had castration-resistant disease. Shorttermconcomitant ADT was recommended in all hormone-naive patients but decided in consultation with the patient. Ultimately, 20 patients received ADT while 20 did not. The two groups were well balanced, with no significant differences in age, Gleason score, PSA, lesion type, number or timing ofmetastases, and fractionation schedule. All patients received a PSMA-PET/CT at 6months after SBRT. PSMA-RADS v1.0 was used to categorize the response of the treated lesion. Quality-of-life (QOL) scoring was performed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Result(s): Median follow-up for all patients was 9.6months (IQR 6.3 - 12.9months). Up till now, 42 lesions could be reevaluated at 6 months after SBRTwith PSMA-PET/CT, of which 30 showed complete response, 8 partial response and 4 stable disease. No symptomatic or local progression was observed in the irradiated lesions. There was no statistically significant influence of ADT, fractionation, type of lesion or lesion size on LR. Patients who received ADT had significantly improved bPFS (median bPFS of 6.9 months versus median not reached; p=0.0017) and DPFS (medianDPFS of 6.8months versus 17.3 months; p=0.0021). Wedid not observe any clinically relevant changes inQOL scores between the patients who received ADT versus those who refused. Overall, QOL scores remained stable for both groups at baseline, 3 and 6months. Conclusion(s): These prospective data, although non-randomized, suggest that oligometastatic prostate cancer patients treated with SBRT could potentially benefit from short-term ADT. Longer follow-up will determine if ADT simply delays progression or truly alters the course of the disease.",exclusion,Not the right comparator,SBRT vs SBRT+ADT,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdz248.028,,,

New objective methods of predicting overall survival would be beneficial for surgical decision making. Morphometrics quantifies patient frailty and has been successfully used to predict overall survival in patients with lung cancer spinal metastases. This study evaluated whether morphometrics can predict survival in patients with prostate cancer spinal metastases. METHODS: Using a retrospective registry of patients with spinal metastases who underwent stereotactic body radiation therapy, we identified patients with primary prostate cancer. Morphometric measurements of the psoas muscle were taken from most recent lumbar spine computed tomography. Patients were stratified into lowest, middle, and highest tertiles based on psoas muscle area. Primary outcome measure was overall survival from the date of computed tomography scan. RESULTS: We identified 92 patients. Median survival for all patients was 124 days (95% confidence interval, 98-197 days). Patients in the smallest third for average psoas size had significantly shorter survival compared with patients in the largest third: 117 days versus 302 days (hazard ratio 2.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-4.43; P = 0.004). Patients in the middle third for average psoas size also had shorter survival compared with patients in the largest third: 113 days versus 302 days (hazard ratio 2.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-4.25; P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with prostate cancer spinal metastases, morphometric analysis of psoas muscle size can identify patients at risk for shorter survival. This technique can aid in surgical decision making by weighing expected survival and fitness versus potential morbidity of intervention.",exclusion,Other tumor treated (spinal),,10.1016/j.wneu.2018.03.115,ProP41,,
random-journal.pdf,ProM35,"Bernard, Brandon",2016,eng,pro.m:#5;pro.p:#5,Approach to Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer.,"Oligometastatic prostate cancer has increasingly been recognized as a unique clinical state with therapeutic implications. It has been proposed that patients with oligometastases may have a more indolent course and that outcome may be further improved with metastasis-directed local ablative therapy. In addition, there are differing schools of thoughts regarding whether oligometastases represent isolated lesions-where targeted therapy may render a patient disease free-or whether they coexist with micrometastases, where targeted therapy in addition to systemic therapy is required for maximal clinical impact. As such, the approach to the patient with oligometastatic prostate cancer requires multidisciplinary consideration, with surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic therapy potentially of benefit either singularly or in combination. Indeed, mounting evidence suggests durable disease-free intervals and, in some cases, possibly cure, may be achieved with such a multimodal strategy. However, selecting patients that may benefit most from treatment of oligometastases is an ongoing challenge. Moreover, with the advent of new, highly sensitive imaging technologies, the spectrum based on CT of the abdomen and pelvis and technetium bone scan of localized to oligometastatic to widespread disease has become increasingly blurred. As such, new MRI- and PET-based modalities require validation. As some clinical guidelines advise against routine prostate-specific antigen screening, the possibility of more men presenting with locally advanced or de novo oligometastatic prostate cancer exists; thus, knowing how best to treat these patients may become more relevant at a population level. Ultimately, the arrival of prospective clinical data and better understanding of biology will hopefully further inform how best to treat men with this disease.",exclusion,review,Llegir per a informació general sobre oligometastasis,10.1200/EDBK_159241,ProP42,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of SBRT in delaying the start of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients treated with SBRT for oligometastatic recurrence (< 5 metastases) of hormone-sensitive PC, defined with [(18)F]fluoromethylcholine positron emission tomography/computed tomography were included. As a control group, 20 patients with oligometastatic disease not treated with SBRT were identified from another hospital. Data were collected retrospectively. RESULTS: A post-SBRT prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response was seen in 29 (67.4%) of 43 patients. Median ADT-free survival (ADT-FS) was 15.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.7-19.5) for the whole group, and 25.7 months (95% CI, 9.0-42.4) for patients with a PSA response. Seven patients were treated with a second course of SBRT because of oligometastatic disease recurrence; the ADT-FS in this group was 32.1 months (95% CI, 7.8-56.5). Compared with the control group, the ADT-FS from first diagnosis of metastasis was significantly longer, with 17.3 (95% CI, 13.7-20.9) months versus 4.19 months (95% CI, 0.0-9.0), P < .001. Also, time between diagnosis of the metastasis until progression of disease during ADT use (castration resistance) was longer for the SBRT-treated patients (mean 66.6, 95% CI, 53.5-79.8, vs. 36.41, 95% CI, 26.0-46.8 months, P = .020). There were no grade III or IV adverse events reported.

Intensification of systemic treatment is the standard of care. Recently, (68)Ga prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) imaging was introduced to identify oligometastatic prostate cancer patients. In this retrospective, exploratory study, we report on the efficacy of PSMA-PET-guided local ablative radiotherapy (aRT) in 15 oligometastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients, selected from our prospective institutional database and treated between 2013 and 2016. After multidisciplinary discussion, aRT was delivered with two different schedules. Androgen deprivation therapy remained unchanged. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and time to PSA progression were analysed. For comparison, individual time to PSA progression without aRT was estimated by individual PSA doubling time (PSADT). PSA response was observed in 11 patients (73%). Mean time to PSA progression or last follow-up was 17.9mo, as opposed to 2.9mo estimated from the PSADT without aRT (p<0.001). A relevant subset of CRPC patients had a PSA response with aRT to PET-positive lead metastases. A prospective trial is in preparation. PATIENT SUMMARY: In selected patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase during androgen deprivation, metastases were detected with prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography imaging. Fifteen patients with three or fewer metastases were treated with high-dose radiotherapy. Subsequently, PSA values dropped in 11 patients and in six patients no PSA progression was detected for >12mo.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,10.1016/j.eururo.2018.11.050,ProP47,,

Most recurrences in this scenario are characterized by continuous PSA rises and failure of standard imaging (bone scan [BS] and computed tomography [CT]) to detect recurrence sites. We conducted a Phase II trial for men with rising PSA after MLT using 18F-DCFPyL PET-MR/CT followed by targeted ablation of PET positive foci. We report the results of our pre-defined analysis. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients with rising PSA (0.4 - 3.0 ng/mL) after MLT, negative BS/CT and no prior salvage ADT were eligible. All patients underwent 18F-DCFPyL PET-MR followed by immediate PET-CT acquisition. Those with limited disease, where possible, underwent stereotactic ablative RT (SABR) or surgery. No ADT was used. The primary endpoint was biochemical response rate (complete [undetectable PSA] or partial [PSA decline >=50% compared to baseline]). A Simon's two stage study design was employed. Stage 1 included 12 response-evaluable patients, requiring one or more responses in the absence of Grade 3+ toxicities to proceed to Stage 2 (additional 25 response-evaluable patients). Result(s): After a median of 58 months (range 29-120) post MLT, 20 patients underwent PET-MR/CT to have 12 response-evaluable patients. Median PSA at enrollment was 1.3 ng/mL (range 0.4-2.8). Three patients had negative PET-MR/CT, while 17 had positive scans, of which 12 (60%) were amenable to response-evaluable ablation. The median number of detected lesions in those treated was 2 (range 1-5). Ten patients underwent SABR (27-30 Gy / 3 fractions) and two had surgery. One patient (8%) had complete and four (33%) had partial PSA responses at a median of 3.3 months (range 2.8-6.0) after ablation, while the remaining seven (59%) did not have biochemical response. No Grade 3+ toxicities were observed. Conclusion(s): 18F-DCFPyL PET-MR/CT has high detection rates in men with rising PSA after MLT. We observed favorable early results with SABR or surgery (41% RR; no Grade 3+ toxicities). Accrual completion and preliminary results on the entire cohort are expected for Q1 and Q3 2019, respectively.

Including multiple cohorts each with a different primary tumour site, allows efficient evaluation of safety of SBRT and feasibility of conducting subsequent cohort specific phase III trials; however this also presents several challenges for both trial design and management. Methods and Results: Trial eligibility criteria and patient pathways needed to be carefully considered to fit with different standard of care pathways for each cohort, whilst allowing for a combined analysis. Expertise for each cohort during protocol development and on oversight committees was essential. Similarly, at sites, liaising with three different clinical teams was common, necessitating a coordinated approach and more resources. The trial design originally assumed even recruitment across cohorts, but practically, while recruitment to breast and lung cohorts was as predicted, recruitment to prostate exceeded expectations. With a single recruitment target over all cohorts, the larger number of prostate cancer patients recruited impacted on the statistical assumptions. Recruitment to the prostate cohort was temporarily suspended, while engagement with breast and lung communities was increased, amendments to the protocol were made to improve recruitment to these cohorts and discussions around the implications to the trial design were had with the Trial Steering Committee. The control group progression-free survival estimate was revised based on the recruitment ratio seen between the cohorts and therefore the sample size was increased. Discussion(s): Recruitment was completed in February 2019. Frequent collaboration with the trial oversight committees and sites, and close monitoring of recruitment, enabled effective trial design and management to maximise the information gained from the trial, including the feasibility of subsequent phase III trials.",exclusion,Article on challenges of trial protocol,Check whether there are new results published from this clinical study,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-019-3688-6,ProP49,,

Leading edge targeted molecular imaging techniques show promise for identification of potentially targetable lesions not apparent on conventional imaging (CT, MRI, or bone scan). We have characterized the impact of the investigational prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based 18F-DCFPyL PET imaging on the detection and radiotherapeutic management of prostate cancer. Purpose/Objective(s): Records from 31 patients who underwent 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging as part of clinical trials at our institution and were subsequently treated with radiotherapy between June 2015 and February 2017 were reviewed. The concordance of this technique with conventional imaging, its ability to detect new sites of disease, and the resultant effects on treatment modality, radiation target volumes, and dose prescription were analyzed and tabulated. Result(s): 18F-DCFPyl PET radiotracer uptake was observed in 30 patients with PSA values ranging from undetectable to 360 ng/mL (median 0.4 ng/mL). Lesions not appreciated on conventional imaging were identified in 71% of the cohort, while 23% of patients had lesions indeterminate on conventional imaging that demonstrated no radiotracer uptake. Changes in radiotherapy management following 18F-DCFPyl PET imaging include: 52% of patients were treated with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) to newly appreciated lesions; pelvic nodes demonstrating uptake were boosted in 23%; and salvage radiotherapy IMRT fields were asymmetrically expanded to boost areas of radiotracer uptake in the prostate bed in 6%. An additional 23% of patients were spared treatment to lesions assessed as less concerning based on lack of radiotracer avidity. Conclusion(s): 18F-DCFPyL PET imaging provides unique diagnostic data complementary to conventional techniques. This can impact initial TNM staging, effect treatment paradigms for recurrent disease, guide radiotherapy treatment planning by identifying lesions not otherwise appreciated and elucidating the character of indeterminate lesions. Importantly, radiotracer uptake can be seen at low and even undetectable PSA levels, potentially allowing earlier detection and treatment of low-volume metastases, a major goal in the evolving treatment of oligometastatic prostate cancer. Recognized limitations of this preliminary report include lack of biopsy confirmation of radiotracer-avid lesions and long term follow up to correlate treatment decisions with clinical outcomes, however these questions are areas of ongoing prospective investigation at our institution.",exclusion,Not dealing with the intervention of interest,Compares two imaging techniques,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.06.1224,ProP51,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Upfront chemotherapy prolongs survival in metastatic prostate cancer, according to the ChemoHormonal Therapy versus Androgen Ablation Randomized Trial for Extensive Disease in Prostate Cancer and STAMPEDE docetaxel trials. However, the benefit is driven by the high volume subset and may not apply to low-volume/oligometastatic patients. SUMMARY: Oligometastatic patients may not all share the same biology. Advanced imaging techniques may help to more accurately identify truly oligometastatic patients. Molecular markers will be necessary to distinguish oligometastatic patients who fare well enough with androgen deprivation therapy alone as opposed to those for whom upfront chemotherapy may be beneficial. Emerging molecular markers of docetaxel sensitivity, such as loss of lysine-specific demethylase 5d, warrant prospective validation with one goal of identifying oligometastatic patients with greatest likelihood of benefit from this strategy.",exclusion,Review on chemotherapy,,10.1097/MOU.0000000000000446,,,

We sought to identify prognostic criteria in oligometastatic patients undergoing definitive hypofractionated image-guided radiotherapy (HIGRT). METHODS: Exclusively extracranial oligometastatic patients treated with HIGRT were pooled. Characteristics including age, sex, primary tumor type, interval to metastatic diagnosis, number of treated metastases and organs, metastatic site, prior systemic therapy for primary tumor treatment, prior definitive metastasis-directed therapy, and systemic therapy for metastasis associated with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and treated metastasis control (TMC) were assessed by the Cox proportional hazards method. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) identified prognostic risk strata for OS and PFS based on pretreatment factors. RESULTS: 361 patients were included. Primary tumors included non-small cell lung (17%), colorectal (19%), and breast cancer (16%). Three-year OS was 56%, PFS was 24%, and TMC was 72%. On multivariate analysis, primary tumor, interval to metastases, treated metastases number, and mediastinal/hilar lymph node, liver, or adrenal metastases were associated with OS. Primary tumor site, involved organ number, liver metastasis, and prior primary disease chemotherapy were associated with PFS. OS RPA identified five classes: class 1: all breast, kidney, or prostate cancer patients (BKP) (3-year OS 75%, 95% CI 66-85%); class 2: patients without BKP with disease-free interval of 75+ months (3-year OS 85%, 95% CI 67-100%); class 3: patients without BKP, shorter disease-free interval, ≤ two metastases, and age < 62 (3-year OS 55%, 95% CI 48-64%); class 4: patients without BKP, shorter disease-free interval, ≥ three metastases, and age < 62 (3-year OS 38%, 95% CI 24-60%); class 5: all others (3-year OS 13%, 95% CI 5-35%). Higher biologically effective dose (BED) (p < 0.01) was associated with OS.

Hypofractionated SBRT as a boost to conventional ex-ternal beam radiation therapy (EBRT) allows increased radiation dosage with decreased frequency of delivery. This analysis reports on early prostate-cancer-specific quality of life outcomes in patients with localized non-metastatic high risk prostate cancer treated with hypofractionated SBRT boost on a Phase 2 in-house clinical trial. We hypothesize that hypofractionation will increase dose-equivalent delivered to tumor with comparable toxicity profile as measured by quality of life outcomes. Methodology: From September 2011 to November 2015, 12 patients with localized high risk prostate cancer were treated with androgen dep-rivation therapy (ADT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to the pelvis (45 Gy) and hypo-fractionated SBRT boost. Robotic SBRT delivered a total dose of 21 Gy in three fractions. Quality of life was assessed using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26 (EPIC 26) and the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions test (EQ-5D). These parameters were recorded at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 months, 2, 3 and 5 years after treatment. Here, we report on early outcomes of the study at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months after treatment. A two tailed paired t-test was used to compare the data before and after treatment. Result(s): Twelve patients underwent EBRT with hypofractionated SBRT boost. After the first 10 patients treated reached 6 months of follow-up, interim safety analysis revealed no grade 3-5 rectal toxicity. A mean baseline EPIC-26 urinary irritation/obstructive score of 80.2 decreased to 71.4 at 1 month post-treatment (p = 0.19) but returned to baseline with 81.3 at 3 months post-treatment (p = 0.82). At baseline, 25% of men described their urinary function as a moderate to big problem, and that proportion increased to 50% 1 month following completion of SBRT before decreasing to 33.3% at 18 months. Zero percent of men described their bowel function as a moderate to big problem at baseline. The proportion increased to 8.3% 1 month post-treatment before going back to baseline at 18 months. Conclusion(s): Hypofractionated SBRT boost for the treatment of high risk prostate cancer was well tolerated as determined by urinary irritation, incontinence and bowel function and bother. Symptoms were comparable to those observed following traditional EBRT.

The immediate (concomitant) use of ADT in this clinical setting potentially augments the efficacy of SBRT by improving systemic disease control. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of these two treatment strategies. Material(s) and Method(s): Eighty-eight patients with up to three oligometastases and controlled primary disease who had been treated using SBRT with immediate or delayed ADT were included in this retrospective analysis. Progression-free survival (PFS), widespread failure-free survival (WFFS) and freedom from further interventions (FFFI) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard regression methods. Toxicity was evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. Result(s): Thirty-nine patients (44.3%) were treated with SBRT and immediate ADT (continuous ADT, n = 7; intermittent ADT, n = 32) and 49 (55.7%) with SBRT and delayed ADT. The median follow-up was 24 months (interquartile range 13.5-37.0 months). PFS in the immediate and delayed ADT groups were 26 months and 16 months, respectively (P < 0.007). The median WFFS in the immediate ADT group was not reached compared with 21 months in the delayed ADT group (P = 0.025). The 1- and 2-year FFFI in the immediate ADT group were 88% and 64.1%, respectively, significantly higher than those in the delayed ADT group (63.8% and 30.2%, respectively, P < 0.002). Acute toxicities of grade 1-2 occurred in 17.9% of the immediate ADT group and 18.4% of the delayed ADT group (P = 0.96). Only one case of grade 3 late toxicity (pelvic insufficiency) was identified in this study.

Combined local injection of dsRNA analogues (mimicking viral RNA) and repeated vaccination with tumor-lysate loaded dendritic cells shows efficacy against a mouse model of established colon cancer. Method(s): In a pilot phase I clinical trial 16 advanced (stage IV) cancer patients received two cycles of a course consisting of four intradermal daily doses of monocyte-derived dendritic cells preloaded with autologous tumor lysate and matured for 24h with polyICLC (Hiltonol), TNF-A and IFN-A. On days+8 and +10 of each of each cycle, patients received intratumoral image-guided injections of 0.25 mg of Hiltonol. Each cycle was given 3-4 weeks apart and was preceded on day -7 by 600 mg/m2 of cyclophosphamide. The last six patients were given SABR (stereoatactic ablative radiotherapy) in some of the lesions including that injected with Hiltonol. Expression of a series of 25 inmune-relevant genes was sequentially monitored by RT-PCR on circulating PBMCs and serum concentrations of a cytokine panel were sequentially determined. Result(s): Combined treatment was feasible, safe and well tolerated without >grade 2 side effects. No objective responses by RECIST1.1 criteria were observed while nine patients experienced stabilization of disease (five of them in the six-patient radiotherapy cohort). A heavily pretreated castration-resistant prostate cancer patient experienced a remarkable mixed abscopal response to radiotherapy with responding lesions located far from the irradiated region. Response was associated to an increase of CD8 T cells infiltrating the tumor. In this series of patients post-Treatment elevated IFNb and IFNa mRNA in circulating PBMC following intratumoral Hiltonol was detected, in addition to increases of serum IL-12 and IL-1b following DC vaccination, that occurred more prominently in stable disease cases. Conclusion(s): This combination strategy aimed to resembling viral infection in tumor tissue, while on a dendritic-cell vaccine approach and added to radiotherapy is safe for advanced cancer patients and shows indications of immune-Associated activity.",exclusion,Not dealing with the intervention of interest,,,,,

PICOS/PRISMA methods were used to identify published English-language comparative studies on PubMed (from 1980 to 2015) that included men treated on prospective studies with a primary endpoint of patient outcomes, with _70 patients, and _5year median follow up. Twenty-six studies met inclusion criteria; of these, 16 used EBRT, and 10 used BT. Long-term freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) rates were roughly equivalent between conventional and hypofractionated RT with intensity modulation (evidence level 1B), with 10-year FFBF rates of 45-90%, 40-60%, and 20-50% (for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively). SBRT had promising rates of BF, with shorter follow-up (5-year FFBF of >90% for low-risk patients). Similarly, BT (5-year FFBF for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients have generally been >85%, 69-97%, 63-80%, respectively) and BT+EBRT were appropriate in select patients (evidence level 1B). Differences in overall survival, distant metastasis, and cancer specific mortality (5-year rates: 82-97%, 1-14%, 0-8%, respectively) have not been detected in randomized trials of dose escalation or in studies comparing RT modalities. Studies did not use patient-reported outcomes, through Grade 3-4 toxicities were rare (<5%) among all modalities. There was limited evidence available to compare proton therapy to other modalities. The treatment decision for a man is usually based on his risk group, ability to tolerate the procedure, convenience for the patient, and the anticipated impact on quality of life.

Primary endpoint was incidence of SBRT induced late toxicities. Secondary endpoints included various measures of treatment efficacy including cumulative incidence of developing of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and overall survival (OS). Materials/Methods: Synchronous and metachronous metastatic disease presentations were eligible if there were <= 5 metastases, with <= 3 metastases in any single organ system. Conventional scans (CT/bonescan +/- MRI) were used to stage patients at baseline, although novel PET imaging was optional. SBRT was delivered to all sites of disease, including the prostate if not previously treated. SBRT dose was site dependent but was generally 30-35 Gy in 5 fractions for lymph nodes and non-spine bone, 24 Gy in 2 fractions for spine, and 35 Gy in 5 fractions to the prostate. Patients received ADT for 1 year before moving to an intermittent approach. ADT was not to be restarted until the PSA reached >= 10 ng/mL or earlier if clinically indicated. Toxicity (CTCAE v4.0) and PSA measurements were collected every 4 months during follow-up. Conventional scans were performed at a minimum of once per year, although more frequent imaging was allowed at the discretion of the physician. Result(s): 30 patients were accrued with a median age of 74 years. Median follow-up time was 34 months (range 15 - 51). Median baseline PSA was 8.0 ng/mL (range 1.0 - 148.6). 46.7% of patients had Gleason score of 8-10. 9 patients had synchronous disease presentation. Only 3 patients were staged with novel PET imaging. 47 metastases were irradiated, with 36 being in bone. 2 patients developed acute grade 3 GI toxicities. 1 patient developed late grade 3 GU toxicity and 1 patient developed a late SBRT induced bone fracture. There were no grade 4/5 toxicities. Median PSA nadir was 0.03 ng/mL. 46.6% of patients reached a PSA nadir of <= 0.02 ng/mL, while 93% of patients reached a PSA nadir of < 1 ng/mL. The cumulative incidence (CI) of restarting ADT was 47.5% at 3 years. In those who restarted ADT, the median time to the event was 25.8 months. The CI of developing CRPC was 17.2% at 3 years. In those who developed CRPC, the median time to the event was 17.7 months. The CI of local failure of irradiated sites was 10.1% at 3 years. The CI of developing new metastases was 26.3% at 3 years. OS was 89.5% at 3 years. Conclusion(s): The incidence of grade >= 3 toxicity was low when combining SBRT with intermittent ADT in patients with hormone sensitive oligometastatic prostate cancer. Efficacy appears to be promising compared to historical outcomes of using ADT alone, especially with regards to the development of CRPC.

Previous studies have shown that remineralization of lytic bone metastases follows after conventional radiotherapy. The objective of this study was to investigate changes in bone density in nonspine bone metastases following stereotactic body radiation therapy. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted for all patients treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy to nonspine bone metastases between May 2011 and April 2014. A minimum of 1 pretreatment and 1 posttreatment computed tomography scan was required. An independent musculoskeletal radiologist contoured the lesions on the most representative computed tomography slices. Density was measured in Hounsfield units and analyzed using pretreatment and posttreatment ratios. RESULTS: Forty sites were treated (55% lytic, 30% sclerotic, and 15% mixed). The median follow-up duration was 7 months. Lytic osseous metastases from renal cell carcinoma progressed during initial follow-up imaging and then returned to baseline. Of 9 lytic lesions not from renal cell carcinoma, 6 showed an immediate increase in density and 2 remained stable. Six of 7 sclerotic lesions from prostate cancer showed decreased density throughout all follow-ups. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic body radiation therapy is efficacious in the remineralization of lytic and demineralization of sclerotic nonspine bone metastases.",exclusion,Other tumor treated (skeletal),,10.1177/1533034615604068,,,
random-journal.pdf,ProM52,"M., Warren",2015,English,pro.m:#5;pro.p:#5,"Computed tomography guided placement of high activity, low dose rate (HALDR) brachytherapy seeds","Objectives: The trend to fewer, high dose per fraction stereotactic treatments for primary and salvage therapy has grown rapidly in the last decade. Modern technologies are capable of delivering sculpted dose with rapid dose fall off, mimicking dose gradients associated with brachytherapy approaches. One approach that is seldom used but holds great promise employs ultra-simple implants using high activity sources. This technique would be well suited for retreatment from the normal tissue standpoint since dose is delivered over months at a low dose rate. Preliminary responses in refractory tumors suggest efficacy and safety, and a vast potential for combination therapy approaches. HALDR approach allows for CT or ultrasound guided implants to be delivered by small gauge needles to any part of the body. Method(s): HALDR brachytherapy is minimally-invasive, less disruptive in side effects, and requires a small time commitment to the procedure. For heavily pretreated solid tumors, seeds placed within the tumor under CT guidance, with an overnight stay for observation is far easier than heroic resections in a prior radiated field. Three clinical examples will be presented. Result(s): Patient 1 is a 54 yo man with prostate cancer post prostatectomy treated with radiation for rising PSA. He later has a bladder neoplasm and under goes cystectomy. A small cell neoplasm of the bladder is found and subsequently treated with chemotherapy. 4 months after completion he develops a small cell metastasis adherent to the pelvic side wall. He is retreated with beam radiation and chemotherapy with a partial response. 4 months later the mass progresses and no further chemotherapeutic options remain. He underwent placement of 3 high activity I-125 sources by CT guidance delivering approximately 5 cGy/hr. He has a partial response by serial CT and continues with stable disease 36 months after implant. Patient 2 was a 50 yo woman with a head and neck sarcoma treated initially with neck dissection and post-operative radiation therapy and chemotherapy. 2 years later there is recurrence treated with partial resection, chemotherapy, and salvage external beam therapy. 1.5 years later she develops two discrete nodules in the neck ranging from 4-5 cm. She undergoes CT guided I-125 high activity seed implant with dramatic response of both lesions. 8 months later, she develops two other recurrences treated with high activity sources and again achieves excellent palliation for 6 months. Patient 3 is a 66 year old male with a pancreatic tail adenocarcinoma who had a PET CT that showed an SUV of 10.5. After treatment with chemotherapy he had minimal change in the size of the neoplasm and underwent CT guided placement of two external beam markers and two I-125 seeds (22.9 cGycm2/hr for a total of 103 Gy). 19 days later a repeat PET CT demonstrated that the lesion had decreased in size and now had an SUV of 4.4. Conclusion(s): CT guided placement of HALDR brachytherapy is a promising backup and alternative to hypofractionated SBRT approaches for salvage of refractory local ized solid tumors. In preliminary reports and experience such low dose rate therapy has been well tolerated even in patients treated with initial full dose with external beam and SBRT salvage, confirming the normal tissue sparing effects of low dose rate implants. Since most practitioners may employ this in very limited number of patients, an international registry may be necessary to further define the potential of this approach in anticipation of prospective trials.",exclusion,Not dealing with intervention of interest,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2015.03.007,ProP62,,

The term oligometastases describes an intermediate metastatic state, in which cancer exists as a limited number of metastases at first, before cells acquire the ability to metastasise more widely. For the large majority of solid cancers, once metastatic disease has been diagnosed the chances of cure are small. There are several situations where this is not the case, but it is not known if stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for oligometastatic disease will alter outcomes or whether the toxicity burden of this treatment is justified. SBRT is targeted radiotherapy which destroys cancer cells in the area of the body it is aimed at however low dose radiation may be received by surrounding tissue.
random-journal.pdf,It is difficult to quantify incidence of patients with multiple primary cancers developing at intervals that are representative of oligometastatic stage IV disease, (defined for the purposes of this trial as ≤ 3 metastatic sites). However an increase in the use of surveillance imaging, together with improved diagnostic sensitivity has led to the diagnosis of patients with asymptomatic oligometastatic relapse becoming a more common clinical occurrence. The CORE study is a randomized controlled trial that will be conducted in patients with cancer in one of three primary sites where oligometastatic disease relapse is a common clinical scenario: breast, prostate and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study will evaluate the use of SBRT in this patient population.

Interestingly, the preclinical work has consistently predicted the responses encountered in clinical trials. The first example came from a proof-of-principle trial started in 2001 that tested the concept that growth factors acting on antigen-presenting cells improve presentation of tumor antigens released by radiation and induce an abscopal effect. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor was administered during radiotherapy to a metastatic site in patients with metastatic solid tumors to translate evidence obtained in a murine model of syngeneic mammary carcinoma treated with cytokine FLT-3L and radiation. Subsequent clinical availability of vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibitors has triggered a wave of enthusiasm for testing them in combination with radiotherapy. Examples of ongoing clinical trials are described in this report. Importantly, most of these trials include careful immune monitoring of the patients enrolled and will generate important data about the proimmunogenic effects of radiation in combination with a variety of immune modulators, in different disease settings. Results of these studies are building a platform of evidence for radiotherapy as an adjuvant to immunotherapy and encourage the growth of this novel field of radiation oncology.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",exclusion,Review inmunotherapy + radioation,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.semradonc.2014.07.003,,,

Analysis of prognostic and predictive factors was also performed. Material consisted of 51 patients with 71 bone oligometastases treated using CK SRS/SABR. In half of the patients single lesion was treated, in half 2-5 lesions. Median PSA concentration at the time of metastasis detection was 5.75 ng/ml. Total dose of 6-45Gy (median 20) was delivered with 1-5 fractions of 6-15 Gy (median 9). Biologic equivalent dose (BED) (_/_=1.6) over 100 Gy was delivered to 45 lesions (63%) in 38 patients (75%). In statistical analysis Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test and the Cox proportional hazard model were used. One-, two- and three-year overall survival (OS) was 90%, 76% and 70%, respectively. All patients having PSA concentration lower that 1 ng/ml at last control lived at least three years. One-, two- and three- year local control (LC) was 97%, 70% and 30%. Patients with PSA below 20 ng/ml at the time of metastasis detection had better local control of lesions and lower PSA at the last control. Median of PSA concentration after CK based SRS/SABR remains stable during first 12 months of follow-up, dropped during the next months and at last control was comparable to initial level. Median PSA at last control in patients without disease progression was 1.67ng/ml and 20 patients had PSA below 1.0ng/ml. At the last control 59% of patients had no other metastases. Rapid pain decrease was observed in analysed group and during each control about 90% of patients had pain relief. No major toxicity was observed, 3 patients suffered from fracture of irradiated bone.SRS/SABR of prostate cancer bone oligometastases provides good LC of lesions, excellent pain control without additional toxicity. Patients with PSA concentration below 20ng/ml at the time of metastasis detection have better LC and PSA concentration response.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,10.4149/218_150807N435,,,

Over a third of prostate cancer (PCa) patients treated with radical prostatectomy and postoperative radiotherapy experience disease recurrence; these patients are considered incurable by current standards. Often the recurrence cannot be localised by conventional imaging (CT and bone scan). Combined anatomical imaging with CT and/or MR with positron emission tomography (PET) using a novel second-generation prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) probe, [ 18 F]DCFPyL, is a promising imaging modality to unveil disease deposits in these patients. A new and earlier molecularly defined oligorecurrent (OR) state may be amenable to focal-targeted ablative curative-intent therapies, such as stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) or surgery, thereby significantly delaying or completely avoiding the need for palliative therapies in men with recurrent PCa after maximal local treatments. Methods and analysis This ongoing single-institution phase II study will enrol up to 75 patients total, to include up to 37 patients with response-evaluable disease, who have rising prostate-specific antigen (range 0.4-3.0 ng/mL) following maximal local therapies with no evidence of disease on conventional imaging. These patients will undergo [ 18 F]DCFPyL PET-MR/CT imaging to detect disease deposits, which will then be treated with SABR or surgery. The primary endpoints are performance of [ 18 F]DCFPyL PET-MR/CT, and treatment response rates following SABR or surgery. Demographics and disease characteristics will be summarised and analysed descriptively. Response rates will be described with waterfall plots and proportions. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was obtained from the institutional Research Ethics Board. All patients will provide written informed consent. [ 18 F]DCFPyL has approval from Health Canada. The results of the study will be disseminated by the principal investigator.

We present the initial surgical outcomes of a novel protocol. Material(s) and Method(s): A phase II study conducted at our institution began accruing patients in 2016. Men with newly-diagnosed synchronous oligometastatic prostate cancer (T1-4, N0-1, M1a-b) consisting of <=5 metastatic lesions were treated with the following therapies: (1st) systemic chemo-hormonal therapy with up to 6 months of neoadjuvant ADT and up to 6 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy, (2nd) consolidation with radical prostatectomy (RP) +/- adjuvant radiation therapy (XRT), and (3rd) stereotactic radiation (SBRT) to oligometastatic lesions. Patients who underwent prior therapy for localized prostate cancer or to a metastatic site, or who received prior systemic therapy, were excluded. Surgical outcomes and complications were evaluated. Result(s): To date, 28 patients have enrolled in the study and 14 have undergone RP. For men undergoing surgery, median age was 60 years with median follow-up of 7 months. Patients had a median 2.5 sites of metastases (range, 1-5) and PSA 13.5 (range, 3.6-953) at diagnosis.

Men with newly diagnosed oligometastatic prostate cancer (T1-4, N0-1, M1a-b) consisting of <=5 metastatic lesions were treated with the following: (1st) systemic therapy with up to 6 months of neoadjuvant ADT and 6 cycles of docetaxel+ADT, (2nd) consolidation with radical prostatectomy (RP) +/- adjuvant radiation therapy (XRT), and (3rd) +/- stereotactic radiation (SBRT) to oligometastatic lesions. RESULT(S): To date, 18 patients have enrolled in the study: 17 have undergone RP and 1 is currently receiving neoadjuvant systemic therapy. For men undergoing surgery, median age was 58.0 years (IQR 55.0-64.0) with median follow-up of 10.1 months (IQR 4.1-13.2).

Subsequently, the 2014 NCCN guidelines have introduced labeled choline PET/CT in the imaging algorithm of patients with suspected recurrent disease. However, there is only scarce data on the impact of labeled choline PET/CT findings on disease management. We hypothesized that labeled-choline PET/CT studies showing local or regional recurrence or distant metastases will have a direct role in selection of appropriate patient management and improve radiation planning in patients with disease that can be controlled using this mode of therapy. METHODS: This retrospective study was approved by the Tel Aviv Sourasky and Sheba Medical Center's Helsinki ethical review committees. Patient characteristics including age, PSA, stage, prior treatments, and pre-PET choline treatment recommendations based on NCCN guidelines were recorded. Patients with biochemical failure and without evidence of recurrence on physical examination or standard imaging were offered the option of additional imaging with labeled choline PET/CT. Treatment recommendations post-PET/CT were compared with pre-PET/CT ones. Pathologic confirmation was obtained before prostate retreatment. A nonparametric _ test was used to compare the initial and final treatment recommendations following choline PET/CT. RESULTS: Between June 2010 and January 2014, 34 labeled-choline PET/CT studies were performed on 33 patients with biochemical failure following radical prostatectomy (RP) (n=6), radiation therapy (RT) (n=6), brachytherapy (n=2), RP+salvage prostate fossa RT (n=14), and RP+salvage prostate fossa/lymph node RT (n=6). Median PSA level before imaging was 2 ng/mL (range, 0.16 to 79). Labeled choline PET/CT showed prostate, prostate fossa, or pelvic lymph node increased uptake in 17 studies, remote metastatic disease in 9 studies, and failed to identify the cause for biochemical failure in 7 scans.PET/CT altered treatment approach in 18 of 33 (55%) patients (P=0.05). Sixteen of 27 patients (59%) treated previously with radiation were retreated with RT and delayed or eliminated androgen deprivation therapy: 1 received salvage brachytherapy, 10 received salvage pelvic lymph node or prostate fossa irradiation, 2 brachytherapy failures received salvage prostate and lymph nodes IMRT, and 3 with solitary bone metastasis were treated with radiosurgery. Eleven of 16 patients retreated responded to salvage therapy with a significant PSA response (<0.2 ng/mL), 2 patients had partial biochemical responses, and 3 patients failed. The median duration of response was 500±447 days. Two of 6 patients with no prior RT were referred for salvage prostatic fossa RT: 1 received dose escalation for disease identified in the prostate fossa and another had inclusion of ""hot"" pelvic lymph nodes in the treatment volume. CONCLUSIONS: These early results suggest that labeled choline PET/CT imaging performed according to current NCCN guidelines may change management and improve care in prostate cancer patients with biochemical failure by identifying patients for referral for salvage radiation therapy, improving radiation planning, and delaying or avoiding use of androgen deprivation therapy.",exclusion,Not dealing with the intervention of interest,,10.1097/COC.0000000000000139,,,

This study compares long-term outcomes from two prospective trials of prostate SABR to investigate the effect of increasing dose. Purpose/Objective(s): All patients received 5 weekly fractions to the prostate. Study 1 patients had low risk prostate cancer and received 35Gy. Study 2 patients had low-or intermediate-risk prostate cancer and received 40Gy. Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (nADT) was allowed for cytoreduction. Patients were followed q6monthly for 6-60 months after SABR, yearly thereafter. Biochemical failure (BF) was defined by nadir + 2 definition with cumulative incidence estimated by Nelson-Aalen curves. The difference in nadir PSA values (nPSA) was calculated using Wilcoxon rank-sum nonparametric test. Overall survival (OS) was estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves. Survival differences between studies were determined using the Log-rank test. Result(s): One hundred fourteen patients were included (study 1, 84 patients; study 2, 30 patients).

METHODS: The (a) and (b) arms investigated primary and metastatic lung cancer differentiated by site of onset, arm (c) included primary or metastatic lesions outside the thorax, the (d) and (e) arms were for in-field reirradiation of recurrence, and finally, the (f) and (g) arms were for boost irradiation to the lesions after an adjuvant RT prescribed dose. A 4 months cut-off after previous irradiation course was fixed to distinguish the boost from the retreatment (<4 vs >4 months, respectively). Patients were prospectively enrolled in study arms according to tumor site, clinical stage and previous treatment. The total dose prescribed to the isocenter, ranged from 20 to 50 Gy according to the protocol design and the doses per fraction ranged from 4 to 10 Gy in 5 days. RESULTS: A total of 281 patients (M/F: 167/114; median age: 69 years) with 376 lesions underwent SBRT. No acute toxicity was reported in 175 patients (62.3%) while 106 (37.7%) experienced only low-grade (G < 2) acute toxicity. Four patients (all previously irradiated in the same site) showed >Grade 2 toxicity within 6 months from SBRT.

Evidence suggests that stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for OM prostate cancer may improve clinical outcomes, but localization of multiple small lesions for treatment is challenging with conventional X-ray-based imaging systems, limiting deliverable doses. Biologically-guided radiotherapy (BgRT) is being developed to utilize strong contrast of PET signal for real-time intra-fraction tracking of multiple targets. This study investigates PSMA-directed BgRT using a cohort from our Phase II randomized trial of SABR to men with recurrent hormone sensitive OM prostate cancer. Method(s): Fifteen patients from our trial treated with SABR and imaged with [18F]DCFPyL PET-CT were used to compare clinical SABR plans versus BgRT plans generated from a prototype treatment planning system (TPS). The TPS models a 6MV linear accelerator mounted on a ring gantry that includes PET detectors and high-speed binary multi-leaf collimator (MLC). The PET signal is used as a biological-fiducial to indicate target location. Photon fluence is thus optimized as a function of PET activity within a user-defined ""firing zone"". Clinical SABR and BgRT plans were compared in terms of maximum PTV dose (Dmax), mean dose to proximal organs at risk (DOAR), conformity index, gradient index, and the correlation of Dmax with maximum PET activity. Result(s): Clinical SABR and BgRT plans resulted in mean+/-standard deviation Dmax of 128+/-11% and 150+/-13% (p<0.001), DOAR of 11+/-8% and 10+/-8% (p=0.02), conformity indices of 0.74+/-0.08 and 0.72+/-0.08 (p=0.4), and gradient indices of 4.47+/-0.63 and 5.40+/-0.83 (p=0.003), respectively. Dmax and maximum PET activity had correlation coefficients of -0.15 (p=0.6) and 0.59 (p=0.02) for clinical SABR and BgRT. Conclusion(s): BgRT plans resulted in increased PTV dose and decreased OAR dose while incorporating underlying PET activity to enable real-time biological guidance, demonstrating the feasibility of PSMA-directed BgRT for OM prostate cancer.

This study characterizes and identifies factors associated with changes in radiation treatment (RT) plans based on PSMA PET imaging results. Purpose/Objective(s): All patients who received a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT or PET/MRI under two clinical trials (NCT02611882 and NCT02918357) and subsequent RT at our institution were included. Eligible patients were treatment naive with high-risk disease (Gleason score >= 4+4, CAPRA (Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment) score >= 5, PSA >=15 ng/mL) or had biochemical recurrence with PSA doubling time of less than 12 months. Changes in RT plans were based on our institutional policy of boosting PET-avid lymph nodes with consideration for treating para-aortic nodes. Mann-Whitney U and chi-squared tests were used to assess the effect of clinical factors such as sites of PSMA uptake on changes to RT plans. Result(s): 130 patients had RT after PSMA PET imaging. Median age was 70 years (interquartile range (IQR) 65-73 years). In treatment naive patients (n=44), median PSA was 15.1 ng/dL (IQR 8.6-23.4 ng/dL). In patients with biochemical recurrence the median PSA was 1.9 ng/dL (IQR 0.68-6.1 ng/dL). Median time since RP and RT was 6 years (IQR 0.5-6.4 years) and 4.8 years (IQR 2.2-8.4 years) respectively. 119 patients (91%) had PSMA avid disease. Of these, 69 (53%) had uptake in the prostate or seminal vesicles (pre-RP/post RT) or prostatic fossa (post-RP), and 51 (39%) had uptake in pelvic lymph nodes (PLN). Limited bony metastatic disease was found in the ribs (9 patients, 6.9%) and pelvic bones (8 patients, 6.1%). Radiation treatment plans were altered based on PSMA PET results in 73 patients (56%). RT plans were adjusted to boost involved lymph nodes in 53 patients (41%). Para-aortic nodes were treated in 24 patients (18%). SBRT was used to treat isolated nodal recurrences in 6 patients (4.6%) and isolated bone metastases in 5 patients (3.8%). Six patients (4.6%) received SBRT to lymph nodes and bone lesions and 3 patients (2.3%) were treated with brachytherapy. Those with PSMA uptake in PLN were more likely to have altered RT plans (60% vs. 13%, p < 0.001). In those with plans that were adjusted, 7% did not receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), 22% received short term ADT, and 71% received long-term ADT, compared to 24%, 25%, and 51%, respectively, in those with standard RT plans (p = 0.016). PLN involvement was significantly associated with long-term ADT use (p = 0.045). Conclusion(s): PSMA PET imaging altered RT plans in a majority of patients and was associated with increased use of long-term ADT for node positive disease.

Fortunately, with the development of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), treatment of lung cancer usher in a new era, resulting in a hit of precise therapy and molecule sequencing. However, it is inevitable for patients to gain acquired resistance of EGFR TKI. Several studies have been demonstrated that there were approximately 30% heterogeneous cells in primary tumors. And emerging studies illuminated that main pattern of treatment failure was the recurrence of primary site. Moreover, it was proved that despite of the drug_resistance cells in progressive site, continual prescription of EGFR TKI in oligometastasis lung cancer could make a difference for patients in progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), owing to the residual responsive cells in another sites. Therefore, to explore an unique method to control heterogeneous cells in primary site so as to delay or prevent acquired resistance when taking EGFR TKI orally may be of great benefit and therapy. It is known to all that stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), with the advantage of hypofractionation and rapid release, succeed in several cancers, such as early lung cancer, prostatic, liver cancer and so on, for local control. Numerous reports explained SBRT played an irreplaceable role in progressive NSCLC patients after oral targeted medicine, regardless of EGFR or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutation. And the radiosensitivity of EGFR TKI in vitro and vivo may account for these inspiring results. What's more, it has reported that SBRT could induce inflammatory cell death, activate dendritic cell as well as accelerate antigen presentation in the draining lymph node, leading to antigen_specific adaptive immune response. Nevertheless, although the potential effects of SBRT on advanced NSCLC are obviously, few studies explore the preventive benefits of early SBRT combined with oral EGFR TKI on advanced lung cancer by eliminating the heterogeneous cells in primary site. In addition, the investigators' previous phase II study of SBRT combined with oral EGFR TKI had revealed its safety and potentially improvement of PFS for 6 months. In this trial, the investigators put sight into assessing the efficacy of early application of SBRT to primary site in the advanced NSCLC patients and provide a hypothesis that early SBRT could strengthen the anti_tumor effect of EGFR TKI through eradicating the heterogenity of initial tumor cells.",exclusion,Other tumor treated (lung),,,ProP80,,

METHODS: Inclusion criteria of the present multicentre retrospective analysis were: (1) oligorecurrent PC, defined as the presence of 1-3 lesions (bone or nodes) detected with choline positron emission tomography or CT plus bone scan following biochemical recurrence; (2) oligo-CRPC, defined as metastases (bone or nodes) detected after a prostatic-specific antigen rise during androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Primary end points were: distant progression-free survival (DPFS) and ADT-free survival in oligorecurrent PC patients; DPFS and second-line systemic treatment-free survival in oligo-CRPC patients. RESULTS: About 100 patients with oligorecurrent PC (139 lesions) and 41 with oligo-CRPC (70 lesions), treated between March 2010 and April 2016, were analysed. After a median follow-up of 20.4 months, in the oligorecurrent group 1- and 2-year DPFS were 64.4 and 43%. The rate of LC was 92.8% at 2 years. At a median follow-up of 23.4 months, in the oligo-CRPC group 1- and 2-year DPFS were 43.2 and 21.6%. Limitations include the retrospective design.

Both stereotactic body RT (SBRT) and elective pelvic nodal RT (ENRT) have been used in this setting and are considered valid, even if still investigational treatment options. However, the best way to irradiate patients with an exclusive oligometastatic nodal disease remains debated. Most subsequent relapses after only SBRT for nodal recurrences are nodal and oligometastatic. The concept of spatial cooperation between SBRT and ENRT is also attractive in this kind of clinical scenario. Hence, in this area we present our preliminary results in terms of early outcomes and toxicity data combining ENRT and SBRT on the pelvic nodal relapses after primary treatment for PCa. Material(s) and Method(s): From April 2017 to March 2018, 12 patients with 15 isolated lymph nodes of recurrent prostate cancer were treated combining ENRT with SBRT on pelvic nodal relapses in single-institution retrospective study of the University Hospital of Udine (ASUIUD). Patient features are summarized in Table I. All patients underwent Choline-PET or PSMA PET/ CT to assess local failure. The prophylactic lymph nodal delineations followed the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) guidelines. A three-dimensional volumetric margin of 5 mm was grown all around the prophylactic and gross nodal clinical target volume to generate the respective nodal PTV. A SIB schema was designed to deliver 54 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction) to the pelvic lymph nodals, and 60 Gy (2 Gy/fraction) to the positive nodals. The SBRT treatment was designed to deliver in one session 10 Gy to the positive nodes. The delivery techniques employed were IMRT and VMAT. The main focus planning was achieving good target coverage (V95>=95) with optimal organ sparing. For organs at risk, the dose constraints used are derived from QUANTEC Neoadjuvant ADT was administered for to all patients for a median time of 3 months. Routine institutional image-based patient position verification protocols foresaw daily on-line matching by CBCT. The acute and late toxicities were recorded using the RTOG/EORTC scale. Restaging with TC/PET was performed 3 months after the end of treatment. Result(s): The median follow-up duration was 6 months (range=3-12 months). The median age was 70 years (range=61-78 years). The median time from primary cancer treatment to ENRT combined with SBRT was 3.4 years (range=2.4-7.9 years) with a primary Gleason score of >= 8 in 4 patients. All patients were treated to pelvic nodal site. One and two oligometastatic lesions were treated in 75% and 25% of patients, respectively. Median PSA values at the time of the Choline-PET and PSMA PET/ CT were 1.16 ng/ml and 0.59 ng/ml, respectively. All patients completed the prescribed radiation treatment, with no interruption. Acute GU toxicity of grade 1 (increase in urinary frequency) was observed in one patient. The incidence of acute GI and GU toxicity of any grade were 14.2% and 35.7%, respectively. No acute and late toxicity >=2 was noted. Biochemical response seems to be complete at 3 months and 10 patients underwent a restaging with TC/PET 3-6 months after the end of treatment with complete metabolic response. Conclusion(s): Combined treatment modalities are safe in the treatment of nodal metacrochronous oligometastatic castration-naive prostate cancer after primary treatment of PCa. These results may provide a basis for a larger phase II study to examine the role of the elective pelvic nodal irradiation combined with focal nodal SBRT in this population currently treated only with focal nodal SBRT.

Our objective was to evaluate a multimodal treatment platform and a short term endpoint of treatment efficacy as a new strategy to rapidly evaluate and prioritize regimens for large-scale phase 3 testing. METHOD(S): We conducted a pilot study of twenty men with oligometastatic M1a (extrapelvic nodal disease) or M1b (bone disease) at diagnosis. All sites of disease were treated using a multimodal approach that included androgen deprivation (ADT), radical prostatectomy plus pelvic lymphadenectomy (retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy in the presence of clinically positive retroperitoneal nodes), and stereotactic body radiotherapy to osseous disease and/or the primary site. ADT was discontinued in responding patients. Outcomes of each treatment were assessed sequentially. The primary endpoint of ""no evidence of disease"" (NED) was defined by an undetectable PSA (<0.05 ng/mL) with noncastrate levels of testosterone at 20 months (>150 ng/dL). RESULT(S): Each treatment modality contributed to the outcome: 95% of the cohort achieved an undetectable PSA with multimodal treatment, including 25% of patients after ADT alone and an additional 50% and 20% after surgery and radiotherapy, respectively. Overall, 20% of patients (95% confidence interval 3-38%) achieved the primary endpoint, which persisted for 5, 6, 27+, and 46+ months. All patients meeting the primary endpoint had been classified with M1b disease at presentation. CONCLUSION(S): Treatment directed at all sites can eliminate detectable disease in selected patients with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer. A multimodal treatment strategy inclusive of the NED endpoint for patients who present with disease that is beyond the limits of curability by any single modality should be considered to enable the evaluation of new approaches in order to prioritize large-scale testing in early stages of advanced disease.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,,,

Method(s): Between 2009 and 2014, 42 patients out of 102 patients with FCH PET for a rising PSA after RP or radiotherapy had positive lymph nodes only. Twenty nine patients had sf-SRT and 13 patients had seni-PRT in a curative intent. Acute and late genito urinary (GU) and gastro intestinal (GI) toxicities were assessed with CTCAE v4. Failure was defined as a rising PSA higher than the maximal pre-therapeutic PSA value followed by 2 consecutive rises or a nodal or distant metastatic failure or the initiation of any salvage therapy. Result(s): Seventy-six nodes were diagnosed with FCH PET/CT with a median PSA value of 2.8 [0.3 -29.2] at time of failure. Mean number of nodes was higher in the seni-PRT group than in the sf-SRT group (2.8 vs 1.6). The median prophylactic dose of WPRT and/or LA was 48.0 Gy [36.0-54.0] and the median dose delivered to involved FCH PET+ nodes was 66.0 Gy [46.0-70.0] with a median dose per fraction of 2.0 [1.8-2.2]. In the sf-SRT group, the median dose to the involved nodes was 36 Gy [18-45] with a median dose per fraction of 7.5 Gy [6-15]. After a median follow-up of 19.1 months [2.9-74.1], no difference was observed for GI or GU toxicities between the 2 groups (p = 0.26 and p = 0.19). One grade 4 GI and GU toxicity occurred in 1 patient in the seni-PRT group. The median freedom from failure (FFF) time was 14.8 months for sf-SRT and 37.6 months for seni-PRT with 2-year FFF rates of 47.8 % and 72.7 %, respectively. Conclusion(s): FCH PET+ node-targeted salvage radiotherapy is feasible with very low rates of toxicity. Freedom from failure was significantly improved with protracted elective nodal irradiation, suggesting that nodal disease diagnosed on FCH PET may not be an oligometastatic disease.

However, large, prospective studies are still required to evaluate the efficacy of this approach in different patient groups. This is the interim analysis of a prospective, single institution study of men relapsing with up to five synchronous lesions following definitive local treatment for primary PCa. Our aim was to determine the proportion of patients not requiring treatment escalation following SBRT. In total, 199 patients were enrolled to receive fractionated SBRT (50 Gray in 10 fractions) to each visible lesion. Fourteen patients were castration resistant at enrolment. The proportion of patients not requiring treatment escalation 2 years following SBRT was 51.7% (95% CI: 44.1-59.3%). The median length of treatment escalation-free survival over the entire follow-up period was 27.1 months (95% CI; 21.8-29.4 months). Prior androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) predicted a significantly lower rate of freedom from treatment escalation at 2 years compared to no prior ADT (odds ratio = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.08-0.54, p = 0.001). There was no difference in the efficacy of SBRT when treating 4-5 vs. 1-3 initial lesions. A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline was induced in 75% of patients, with PSA readings falling to an undetectable level in six patients. No late grade three toxicities were observed.

No standard local treatment exists for patients with an intraprostatic recurrence after radiotherapy. Stereotatic body radiotherapy (SBRT) could be a curative treatment for local recurrence. The phase I/II primary objective is the selection of the recommended dose for salvage-SBRT and to estimate the efficacy. Methods and analysis We plan to perform a multicentre prospective phase I/II study including at least 47 patients. Eligible patients are patients with biochemical recurrence occurring at least 2 years after external radiotherapy for prostatic adenocarcinoma by the Phoenix definition (prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir +2 ng/mL) and histologically proven intraprostatic recurrence only (stage T1-T2 on relapse, PSA level <=10 ng/mL, PSA doubling time >10 months, absence of pelvic or metastatic recurrence proven by choline or PSMA positron emission tomography scan, and pelvic and prostatic assessment by multiparametric MRI). The phase I primary objective is the selection of the recommended dose for salvage-SBRT (5x6, 6x6 or 5x5 Gy) based on dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The dose of salvage-SBRT will be selected using a time-To-event continual reassessment method based on DLT defined as grade >=3 gastrointestinal or urinary toxicity or any other grade 4 adverse event. The phase II primary outcome is to estimate the efficacy of the salvage-SBRT in terms of biochemical relapse-free survival rate (Phoenix definition: increase in serum total PSA >=2 ng/mL above the nadir). Phase II secondary outcomes are acute and late toxicities, quality of life, clinical progression-free survival defined as the time interval between the date of registration and the date of clinical progression or death irrespective of the cause.

We present patient reported health-related Quality-of-life (HR-QoL) outcomes of an SRT schedule with once-weekly fractionation in an unselected cohort of non-metastatic prostate cancer. Method(s): In a Phase I/II study 30 patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer (multiparametric MRI cT1-4N0, M0, Gleason 6-10, PSA < = 60 ng/ml) were treated to a dose of 35Gy in 5 fractions delivered once a week (along with simultaneous elective nodal radiotherapy at 25Gy/5Fr to patients high-risk by NCCN criteria). Androgen deprivation therapy given to intermediate and high-risk patients. Treatments were planned using volumetric intensity modulated arc therapy. Quality of life was assessed using the EORTC QLQ C30 and PR25 questionnaires. HR-QoL parameters at baseline (before start of SRT) was compared to those at treatment completion and 3 months post-SRT.

We postulated that dose escalation may prove beneficial for high risk disease. Given that uniform dose-escalation to 50 Gy in 5 fractions previously resulted in high rates of gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, we investigated the possibility of heterogeneous dose escalation to regions of the prostate not adjacent to the urethra, rectum and bladder in an institutional phase II protocol. Materials/Methods: Thirty-five patients were enrolled on an IRB approved phase II study, with an additional 19 treated per protocol for a total of 54 patients. Treatment employed LINAC based VMAT or IMRT with a rectal balloon (80-100 cc of air) and intrafraction motion monitoring via implanted fiducials. The contoured prostate was expanded by 3mm (0 mm posteriorly). A prescription target of 50 Gy in 5 fractions was delivered to greater than 50% of the portion of PTV >3 mm from sensitive structures (urethra, rectum, bladder), while the seminal vesicles and PTV <3mm from sensitive structures were treated to 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions. Study pts completed the EPIC-26 questionnaire at baseline and 1.5, 4, 8, & 12 months post SBRT. Result(s): Three patients had low, 21 intermediate (5 with multiple risk factors), and 30 high-risk CaP. Median age was 70 years. Median and mean iPSAs were 7.7 and 22.2 ng/ml (Range: 1.6-270.7). Gleason score was 6 in 4 (7%), 7 in 25 (46%), 8 in 10 (19%), and 9 in 15 patients (28%). Androgen deprivation therapy (median 6 months) was given to 32 patients (59%, 3 intermediate risk and 29 of 30 high-risk patients), with 21/32 returning to non-castrate testosterone levels at last followup. At a median follow-up of 15 months treatment was well-tolerated. Two patients experienced late grade 2 GU toxicity (new pad use, cystitis), and two late grade 2 GI toxicity (both proctitis). One uncontrolled diabetic patient with an unusually large prostate (270 cc) developed a prostatic infection 3 weeks after SBRT requiring surgical debridement resulting in grade 4 GI and GU toxicity.

For these patients a traditional course of radiotherapy(RT) remains a critical issue. Furthermore acceleration of RT could improve therapeutic ratio, especially in intermediate risk patients. Therefore we designed a study of hypo-fractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy(SBRT) delivered by Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy(VMAT) with Flattening Filter Free(FFF) beams and gated using beacon transponders. We report our preliminary results on feasibility and early side effects. Material and Methods This is a prospective phase II study. Inclusion criteria were: age<=85 years, PS<=2, PSA<=20 ng/ml and Gleason Score (GS) 7 (NCCN intermediate class of risk), no distant metastases, no previous surgery other than transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), no malignant tumors in the previous 5 years, IPSS<= 7. Patients underwent pelvic MRI. Three beacons transponders were positioned transrectally within the prostate parenchyma by an urologist with an ultrasounds-guided procedure that was performed 7-10 days before simulation CT-scan. MR images were registered with those of simulation CT. The RT schedule was 38 Gy in 4 fractions delivered every other day with VMAT and 10MV FFF photons. Toxicity assessment was performed according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 scale. Results Between September, 2012 and May, 2016, 23 patients were recruited in the protocol and treated. Median follow-up (FUP) was 16 months (range: 7-27). Median age was 74 years (59-79), Median initial PSA (iPSA) was 7.0 ng/ml (range 3.12-12.7 ng/ml). All patients completed the treatment as scheduled, in a median 8 days (8-11). Median nadir-PSA after treatment was 0.78 ng/ml (range 0.2-4). Acute Toxicities were as follow: three patients (13%) presented G1 proctitis. Genito-urinary toxicity was observed in 57% of patients (n=13): in particular, 6 patients had G1 cystitis (26%) with 4 of these presenting even G1 increased urinary frequency (17%) ; G2 cystitis was observed in 7 patients (30%) with a G2 urinary frequency observed in two of these patients (9%); in only one patient a G2 urinary retention was observed and it was treated with transient catheterization and oral and rectal medications. No acute gastrointestinal >= G2 or genitourinary >= G3 toxicity was found. No other toxicities were observed. At a median FUP of 16 months (range 7-27, from the time of diagnosis), only one patient presented an outfield relapse of disease, that was treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). No other biochemical recurrence or progression of disease was observed. Conclusion Preliminary findings show that our schedule of hypofractionated radiotherapy, delivered with FFFVMAT and gated using beacon transponders, is a valid option for intermediate risk PC.

A multicenter national program was developed to assess toxicity and tumor response with hypofractionated stereotactic boost after conventional radiotherapy in intermediate-risk prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Between August 2010 and April 2013, 76 patients with intermediated-risk prostate carcinoma were included in the study. A first course delivered 46 Gy by IMRT (68.4% of patients) or 3D conformal radiotherapy (31.6% of patients). The second course delivered a boost of 18 Gy (3x6Gy) within 10 days. Gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicities were evaluated as defined by NCI-CTCAE (v4.0). Secondary outcome measures were local control, overall and metastasis-free survival, PSA kinetics, and patient functional status (urinary and sexual) according to the IIEF5 and IPSS questionnaires. RESULTS: The overall treatment time was 45 days (median, range 40-55). Median follow-up was 26.4 months (range, 13.6-29.9 months). Seventy-seven per cent (n = 58) of patients presented a Gleason score of 7. At 24 months, biological-free survival was 98.7% (95% CI, 92.8-99.9%) and median PSA 0.46 ng/mL (range, 0.06-6.20 ng/mL). Grade ≥2 acute GI and GU toxicities were 13.2% and 23.7%, respectively. Grade ≥2 late GI and GU toxicities were observed in 6.6% and 2.6% of patients, respectively. No grade 4 toxicity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Hypofractionated stereotactic boost is effective and safely delivered for intermediate-risk prostate carcinoma after conventional radiation.

After a median follow-up of 18.5 months (range=3-103 months), only 2 lesions (4%) relapsed inside the radiation field. All local recurrences were located on the bone. Estimated 12 and 24 months local control ratios were 98.7 and 97.4%, respectively. Except for one case, toxicity greater than G2 was not recorded.

For oligometastases from various primary tumors such as colorectal cancer, sarcomas and renal cell carcinoma, MDT is commonly offered,5-9, 13-15 even though no randomized trials are available comparing MDT with alternative options.13-15 The interest in MDT in PCa has certainly increased with the introduction of more accurate imaging modalities,16, 17 which led to higher detection of oligometastatic PCa recurrence at lower prostate-specific antigen levels.11, 16 However, many questions remain to be solved before MDT is ready for implementation in clinical routine.18.",exclusion,review,Llegir per a informació general,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajco.12557,ProP108,,

The objective of this study was to select candidates for salvage treatment of oligometastatic prostate cancer recurrence by Ch-PET. Method(s): From 2013 to 2015, 30 consecutive prostate cancer patients diagnosed with oligometastatic-recurrence on Ch-PET have been prospectively treated. The recurrence occurred after radical prostatectomy in 22 (74%) patients, after radiotherapy(+/-ADT) in 7 (13%), and after cryotherapy in 1(3%) patient. All patients underwent pelvic multi parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging to assess local failure. All Ch-PET-CT (contrast enhanced) were reviewed by two independent physicians. There was not biopsy confirmation of the pathologic choline uptakes. All patients with biochemical failure after salvage treatment were re-staged by Ch-PETscan. Result(s): Median follow-up was 12 months (range 8-26). The median prePET PSA was 3.96 ng/ml (1.51- 36.4) and median prePET PSA-doubling-time was 4.5 months (1-47.4). Ch-PET showed pathologic uptake consistent with recurrence in lymphnodes in 24 (80%) patients, bone in 4 (14%) patients, bone and nodes in 1 (3%) patient, and bone and prostate in 1 (3%) patient. A total of 64 lesions have been treated. The treatments administered to the initial oligorecurrence uptakes were Intensity-Modulated-Therapy (IMRT) +/- ADT (23 patients; 77%) and Stereotactic- Body-Radiation (SABR) +/- ADT (7 patients; 23%). ADT was administered for no longer than 6 months in 18 patients. At last follow-up, 18 patients are free from biochemical failure and 12 patients showed biochemical failure. Median time to biochemical failure from first salvage treatment was 8 months (2-14). Four (30%) (3 nodal, 1 bone) out of the 12 patients with biochemical failure presented on a repeated Ch-PET oligometastatic disease, and were treated with a second salvage treatment (1 IMRT, 3 SABR). Two of them, are free from biochemical failure at last follow-up. Seven (58%) out of the 12 patients with biochemical failure developed progression on a repeated Ch-PET scan, and in one of them, macroscopic recurrence was not found.

Accurate localisation of disease in this setting may allow treatment modification and improved outcomes, especially in patients with pelvis-confined or extra-pelvic oligometastasis (defined as up to three pelvic nodal or distant sites). We aimed to measure the detection rate of [68]Ga-PSMA-HBNED-CC (PSMA)-PET/CT and its influence on patient management in eBCR of prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy (RP). METHODS: We retrospectively identified 28 patients who underwent PSMA-PET/CT for post-RP eBCR (PSA < 0.5 ng/ml) at our tertiary care cancer centre. Two nuclear medicine physicians independently recorded the sites of PSMA-PET/CT positivity. Multidisciplinary meeting records were accessed to determine changes in management decisions following PSMA-PET/CT scans. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 65.6 years (range: 50-76.2 years); median PSA was 0.22 ng/ml (interquartile range: 0.15 ng/ml to 0.34 ng/ml). Thirteen patients (46.4%) had received radiotherapy in the past. PSMA-PET/CT was positive in 17 patients (60.7%). Only one patient had polymetastasis (> 3 sites); the remainder either had prostatectomy bed recurrence (n = 2), pelvic oligometastasis (n = 10), or extra-pelvic oligometastasis (n = 4). PSMA-PET/CT resulted in management change in 12 patients (42.8%), involving stereotactic body radiotherapy (n = 6), salvage radiotherapy (n = 4), and systemic treatment (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that PSMA-PET/CT has a high detection rate in the eBCR setting following RP, with a large proportion of patients found to have fewer than three lesions. PSMA-PET/CT may be of value in patients with early PSA failure, and impact on the choice of potentially curative salvage treatments.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,Dealing with management decision based on detection techniques,10.1007/s00259-018-4249-z,,,

Distinguishing PP from true tumor progression is critical. OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence, time of onset, and time range of PP following stereotactic body radiation therapy in patients treated for spinal metastases from either prostate cancer (PC) or renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and associated predictive factors. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on our institution's cancer database from 2009 to 2015. Selection was based on single level, no prior radiation or surgery, ≥2 follow-up spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and metastases arising from either PC or RCC. Gross tumor volume was contoured on pre- and up to 5 posttreatment MRIs. Patients were sorted into groups depending on gross tumor volume response: PP, non-PP, or progressive disease. Clinical and dosimetric variables were compared using either Fisher's exact test or Kruskal-Wallis analyses. RESULTS: Forty-three spinal segments from 31 patients were analyzed. RCC and PC patients showed similar incidence of PP (_37%). Whether the primary was lytic or sclerotic was a significant predictive factor with more PP in the lytic group (P = .0208). There was a trend of earlier PP onset in RCC (within 6-18 mo) as compared to PC; however, PC segments showed more time-confined presentation of PP (9-12 mo). CONCLUSION: There was a higher incidence of PP in lytic compared to sclerotic primary tumor type. PP in spinal metastatic sites may have variable presentations depending on the primary cancer.",exclusion,Other tumor treated (spinal),,10.1093/neuros/nyy075,ProP113,,

BCR might be explained by target miss. Improved diagnostic accuracy provided by PET could potentially circumvent this therapeutic gap. Therefore, we evaluated consecutive (68)Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT, (11)C-choline PET/CT, and standard CT imaging in the same patient with regard to TNM-stage migration and accordingly adapted curative radiotherapy options including ablative treatment of oligometastases (n ≤ 5). The cost efficacy of PET- versus CT-based treatment was also calculated. Methods: The prospective register database (064/2013BO1) was retrospectively searched for patients fulfilling the following 3 inclusion criteria: BCR after radical prostatectomy (pT2-pT4 pN0-pN1 cM0, postoperative radiotherapy allowed); (11)C-choline PET/CT, (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT, and diagnostic CT performed within 24 h; and available clinical data. Ten treatment routines were defined according to current practice. Furthermore, intention-to-treat and treatment-related costs depending on the shift of TNM stage after imaging were analyzed. Eighty-three patients were eligible (median prostate-specific antigen level, 1.9 ng/mL). Results: Both PET examinations led to concordant results in 72% of patients, whereas the concordance of TNM staging between (68)Ga-PSMA PET and diagnostic CT was only 36%. Incorrect staging would lead to ""wrong"" treatment and therefore to additional costs. A (68)Ga-PSMA PET study would be cost-effective if additional costs do not exceed €3,844 ($4,312) (vs. CT). The number needed to image was 2 (for CT) and 4 (for (11)C-choline PET) to avoid 1 incorrect treatment. In addition, (68)Ga-PSMA PET staging enabled new curative options in half the patients with previous radiotherapy who otherwise receive palliative androgen deprivation therapy. Conclusion: (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT is cost-effective in all patients with regard to avoidance of incorrect treatment. It enabled new curative options for patients with previous radiotherapy who are usually treated palliatively. Therefore, (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT staging should become standard for BCR after surgery with or without radiotherapy.",exclusion,Not dealing with intervention of interest,Diagnostic techniques,10.2967/jnumed.118.224543,,,

In the case of severe axial loading impairment, anterior column reconstruction is indicated. The authors describe the use of interbody distraction to restore vertebral body height and correct kyphotic angulation prior to reconstruction with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), and report the long-term durability of such reconstruction. METHODS A single institution, prospective series of patients with ESCC undergoing single-stage decompression, anterior column reconstruction, and posterior instrumentation from 2013 to 2016 was retrospectively analyzed. Several demographic, perioperative, and radiographic measurements were collected. Descriptive statistics were compiled, in addition to postoperative changes in anterior height, posterior height, and kyphosis. Paired Student t-tests were performed for each variable. Overall survival was calculated using the techniques described by Kaplan and Meier. RESULTS Twenty-one patients underwent single-stage posterior decompression with interbody distraction and anterior column reconstruction using PMMA. The median age and Karnofsky Performance Scale score were 61 years and 70, respectively. Primary tumors included renal cell (n = 8), lung (n = 4), multiple myeloma (n = 2), prostate (n = 2), and other (n = 5). Eighteen patients underwent a single-level vertebral body reconstruction and 3 underwent multilevel transpedicular corpectomies. The median survival duration was 13.3 months. In the immediate postoperative setting, statistically significant improvement was noted in anterior body height (p = 0.0017, 95% confidence interval [CI] -4.15 to -1.11) and posterior body height (p = 0.0116, 95% CI -3.14 to -0.45) in all patients, and improved kyphosis was observed in those with oblique endplates (p = 0.0002, 95% CI 11.16-20.27). In the median follow-up duration of 13.9 months, the authors observed 3 cases of asymptomatic PMMA subsidence. One patient required reoperation in the form of extension of fusion. CONCLUSIONS In situ interbody distraction allows safe and durable reconstruction with PMMA, restores vertebral height, and corrects kyphotic deformities associated with severe pathological fractures caused by tumor. This is accomplished with minimal manipulation of the thecal sac and avoiding an extensive 360° surgical approach in patients who cannot tolerate extensive surgery.",exclusion,Other tumor treated (spinal),,10.3171/2017.4.SPINE161182,ProP115,,

The importance of consolidating all macroscopic tumor deposits in prostate cancer in the modern era is an unanswered question. Stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR) is highly focused, high-dose radiation that is ideally suited for treatment of oligometastatic patients. There are also exciting animal and patient studies suggesting that SABR can activate the immune system against cancer cells. Here we report on interim safety, clinical and translational outcomes of our Phase II randomized trial of SABR to men with recurrent low volume (1-3 metastases) hormone sensitive metastatic prostate cancer. Material and Methods Patients are randomized 2:1 to SABR:observation with minimization to balance assignment by primary intervention, prior hormonal therapy, and PSA doubling time. Progression after 6 months will be compared using Fisher's exact test. Hazard ratios and Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression free survival (PFS), ADT free survival (ADT-FS), time to locoregional progression (TTLP) and time to distant progression (TTDP) will be calculated based on an intention-to-treat. Local control will be assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria. Adverse events will be summarized by type and grade. Quality of life pre- and post- SABR will be measured by Brief Pain Inventory. Further fundamental analysis of the oligometastatic state with be achieved through correlation with germline DNA repair gene mutations using the Color Genomics panel, investigational 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging and measurement of circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA and deep sequencing of circulating T-cell receptor repertoires. Results Since activation in April 2016 we have had enrollment of 37 men and subsequent randomization of 36 out of the target 54. Thus far, as expected only minimal side-effects (no >Grade 3 toxicity) have been observed from the SABR alone. 67% (6/9) of eligible men on the observation arm have progressed at 6-months versus 33% (5/15) for the SABR arm. 2/20 (10%) men tested had germline DNA repair gene mutations (MUTYH c.1187G>A & CHEK2 c1555C>T). CellSearchTM detected only 1 CTC/7.5-ml in two men and the remaining eight men had no CTCs (20% detectability). In contrast, 9/17 (53% detectability) men had detectable CTCs using the HD-CTC platform and 3/4 (75%) interpretable cases showed a response following SABR. Other radiologic and blood correlatives are pending analysis and will be presented. Conclusion The ORIOLE trial (NCT02680587) is the first randomized Phase II study in the Western Hemisphere evaluating the safety and efficacy of SABR in oligometastatic hormonesensitive prostate cancer. Preliminary clinical data is promising and leading-edge laboratory and imaging correlates will allow an unprecedented opportunity to characterize, in isolation, the effects of SABR on the dynamics of and immunologic response of the oligometastatic state.",exclusion,Not the right comparator,,,ProP116,,

Type of primary, site of metastases, and number of total lesions were analyzed to determine the efficacy of concurrent SBRT and nelfinavir for prostate, sarcoma, and other solid tumor histologies. Purpose/Objective(s): Patients (pts) with <=5 histologic confirmed metastatic lesions (<= 5.0 cm or <=250 cm3) of lung, liver, lymph nodes, or bone, and good performance status (ECOG <= 2) were eligible. Pts were given 1250 mg of nelfinavir twice daily for 7 days prior to and after a single dose of 15 Gy SBRT per lesion. Responses were evaluated based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. Prognostic variables were assessed using log-rank tests and Cox regression analyses. Result(s): Thirty-seven patients with 68 lesions were treated from January 2014-December 2015. Of 37 patients, 19 (51%) had prostate cancer, 8 had sarcoma (22%), 2 had lung (5%), 2 had breast cancer (5%), and 6 other histologies (16%). Of 68 lesions treated, 38 were in bone (56%), 19 were in lung (28%), 8 were in lymph nodes (12%), and 3 were in liver (4%). The median follow-up was 17.9 months (range, 5-31.5 months). The 6-month (6mo) freedom from local progression (FFLP) by treated lesion for prostate, sarcoma, and other primary tumor sites was 91.7%, 56.3%, and 62.5%, respectively (p<0.0001). FFLP by patient for site of metastases in the liver/bone, lymph node, and lung was 77.3%, 100%, and 66.7%, respectively (p=0.11). FFLP by lesion for site of metastases in the liver/bone, lymph node, and lung was 78.0%, 100%, and 63.2%, respectively (p=0.02). Compared with prostate cancer, sarcoma or other primary histologies had higher risk of developing local progression, with HR of 12.1 (p=0.003) and 11.2 (p=0.0027), respectively on univariate analysis. Receiving protocol treatment to 3 or more lesions compared to 1 lesion was associated with a significantly higher FFLP (HR=3.2, p=0.03). Conclusion(s): Local control of the treated lesion after SBRT and nelfinavir was significantly higher in patients with prostate cancer compared to sarcomas and other solid tumor histologies. Additionally, patients who received protocol treatment to one lesion were more likely to be locally controlled than those who received treatment to three or more sites. Prostate cancer patients with less than 3 metastatic lesions may derive the most therapeutic benefit from SBRT delivered to 15 Gy in one fraction in combination with nelfinavir.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.06.1870,ProP119,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-one patients with 106 non-spine bone metastases were treated between 2011 and 2014 and retrospectively reviewed. Indications included: oligometastases (63%), oligoprogression (17.3%), retreatment (2.4%) or other (17.3%). Cumulative incidence function was used to assess local recurrence and fracture probability. Bivariate relationships were investigated based on selected patient, tumour and dose-volume factors. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 13 months (range, 0.25-45.6) and the median patient age was 66.4 years (range, 36-86). Most patients were male (60.5%) and the predominant histology prostate cancer (32%). Bone metastases were most commonly located in the pelvis (41.5%) and almost half sclerotic. The most common prescriptions were 30 Gy/5 (30.2%) and 35 Gy/5 (42.5%). The cumulative incidence of local recurrence at 6,18 and 24 months respectively was 4.7%, 8.3% and 13.3% with a mean time to local recurrence of 11.8 months (range, 3.9-23.4). A significant association was found between local recurrence and volume of the PTV (p = 0.02), with larger PTVs having a greater risk of local failure. Fracture was observed radiographically in the treatment volume in 9/106 (8.5%) of treated lesions and the mean time to fracture was 8.4 months (range, 0.7-32.5 months). With respect to predictors, a trend was observed for lytic lesions (p = 0.11) and female gender (p = 0.09).

By Kaplan-Meier analysis, 5-and 10-year BCR-free survival rates were 98% and 94% in the low-risk group and 96% and 90% in the intermediate-risk group (p < 0.05 by log-rank test). 5-and 10-year overall survival rates were 93% and 86% in the low-risk group and 95% and 91% in the intermediate-risk group (p > 0.05 by log-rank test). Five patients (0.3%) experienced grade 3 acute genitourinary (GU) toxicities, including urinary retention, hematuria, and frequency. 30 (2%) experienced grade 3 late GU toxicity, including urinary strictures, hematuria, and retention. One late grade 4 GU toxicity (hemorrhagic urethritis) and one late grade 4 gastrointestinal toxicity (fistula-in-ano) were seen. Conclusion(s): To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest analysis of long-term outcomes following SBRT for PCa. The results indicate that SBRT has an efficacy and toxicity profile that compares favorably to more widespread forms of treatment, such as conventionally-fractionated external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,Long-term outcomes but no comparator,http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2018.36.6_suppl.84,,,

In the presence of metastatic disease, systemic treatment remains the main clinical option. However, since the introduction of highly sensitive imaging techniques, a new clinical 'entity' of metastatic patients with a limited number of lesions has been defined: oligometastatic patients. In this patient group, the use of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) or other local therapies against all active sites of disease revealed by 18F-choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) could achieve sufficient prostate-specific antigen (PSA) control. However, a clear benefit of this procedure in terms of significant endpoints is yet to be demonstrated. This case report describes our experience with treating a castration-resistant PCa patient with 18F-choline PET/CT-guided SBRT. Because of the occurrence of 5 metachronous lesions over 4 years, the pattern of recurrence was defined by the local multidisciplinary team as oligometastatic disease, and the patient was treated with 5 courses of SBRT which yielded good PSA control. He started systemic therapy with abiraterone acetate almost 5 years after the diagnosis of recurrent PCa.",exclusion,Case-report,,10.1159/000444906,,,

Methods and Materials: This prospective trial included 40 patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer who underwent low-dose-rate (Pd-103) brachytherapy (prescription dose, 100 Gy), followed 1 month later with ultrahypofractionated stereotactic RT (25 Gy in 5 fractions) to the prostate and seminal vesicles. The primary endpoint was the rate of grade 2+ genitourinary toxicity at 12 months using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 4.0. Secondary endpoints included patient-reported quality-of-life metrics (International Prostate Scoring System [IPSS], International Index of Erectile Function, and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-bowel). Biochemical failure was defined as prostate-specific antigen nadir +2 ng/mL. Posttreatment biopsies were performed at between 24 and 36 months; median follow-up was 36 months. Result(s): The rate of grade 2 urinary toxicity at 12 months was 25% with no grade 3 urinary toxicity noted. Mean IPSS at baseline and 12 and 24 months was 5, 10, and 6.2, respectively. Mean change in IPSS from baseline at 12 months was +5.5 (interquartile range, 1-9.75) and +1.05 (interquartile range, -3 to 3.25) at 24 months. Grade 2 bowel toxicity was 5% at 12 months with no grade 3 bowel toxicity noted. Mean Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-bowel domain scores at baseline and 12 months were 92.8 and 90.3, respectively. Of patients who were potent (International Index of Erectile Function >=21) at baseline, 75% remained potent at 12 months. Of 40 patients, 28 underwent posttreatment prostate biopsy (PPB), which was negative (n = 20) or demonstrated severe treatment effect (n = 8). No patient had a positive PPB or developed biochemical failure during the follow-up period. One patient without a PPB developed osseous metastases at 18 months posttreatment in the absence of biochemical failure.

random-journal.pdf,ProM101,"Heidenreich, Axel",2019,eng,pro.m:#5,Management of positive lymph nodes following radical prostatectomy.,"Oligometastatic prostate cancer (PCA) has increasingly been detected in the era of modern imaging studies such as choline-specific and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positron emission tomography and X-ray computed tomography (PET/CT). Recent evidence suggests that durable control is attainable with local treatment modalities such as salvage metastasectomy or stereotactic radiation therapy targeting oligometastases, either with or without the use of systemic therapy.The purpose of this article is to critically review the current findings on the indication, extent, and oncologic outcome of salvage lymphadenectomy (SLND).Oligometastatic PCA is defined by three or less to five metastatic lesions, no rapid spread to more sites, and feasibility of targeted treatment of all metastatic lesions with surgery or radiation therapy. 68Ga-PSMAPET/CT or 18C-choline PET/CT represents the imaging study of choice to identify patients with potential lymph node metastases, and both studies should be performed at prostate-specific antigen serum levels around 1 ng/ml in order to achieve optimal results. If available, 68Ga-PSMA- PET/CT should be preferred because of higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. With regard to pelvic SLND, only data of retrospective studies with a total of more than 400 patients and an evidence level III-IV are available. SLND should always be performed in terms of an extended lymph node dissection. Five-year biochemical free survival ranges between 19 and 25%, 5-year cancer-specific survival varies between 75 and 90%.The median time to systemic treatment is in the range of 20-30 months. Patients with retroperitoneal metastases have a poorer prognosis with less than 10% responding. Optimnal candidates for SLND resulting in a good long-term control could be identified by integrating the following parameters in the clinical decision makong process: presence of Gleason pattern 5, PSA at time of SLND, > positive PSMA-PET/CT signals in the small pelvis, presence of retroperitoneal lymph node metastases, pre-treatment with androgen deprivation therapy at time of biochemical relapse following radical prostatectomy.",exclusion,Review,,,,,
random-journal.pdf,ProM102,"F., Fakhrejahani",2017,English,pro.m:#5,Management Options for Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer,"Prostate cancer is the most common solid tumor malignancy in men worldwide. Treatment with surgery and radiation can be curative in organ-confined disease. Unfortunately, about one third of men develop biochemically recurrent disease based only on rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the absence of visible disease on conventional imaging. For these patients with biochemical recurrent prostate cancer, there is no uniform guideline for subsequent management. Based on available data, it seems prudent that biochemical recurrent prostate cancer should initially be evaluated for salvage radiation or prostatectomy, with curative intent. In selected cases, high-intensity focused ultrasound and cryotherapy may be considered in patients that meet very narrow criteria as defined by non-randomized trials. If salvage options are not practical or unsuccessful, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a standard option for disease control. While some patients prefer ADT to manage the disease immediately, others defer treatment because of the associated toxicity. In the absence of definitive randomized data, patients may be followed using PSA doubling time as a trigger to initiate ADT. Based on retrospective data, a PSA doubling time of less than 3-6 months has been associated with near-term development of metastasis and thus could be used signal to initiate ADT. Once treatment is begun, patients and their providers can choose between an intermittent and continuous ADT strategy. The intermittent approach may limit side effects but in patients with metastatic disease studies could not exclude a 20% greater risk of death. In men with biochemical recurrence, large studies have shown that intermittent therapy is non-inferior to continuous therapy, thus making this a reasonable option. Since biochemically recurrent prostate cancer is defined by technological limitations of radiographic detection, as new imaging (i.e., PSMA) strategies are developed, it may alter how the disease is monitored and perhaps managed. Furthermore, patients have no symptoms related to their disease and thus many prefer options that minimize toxicity. For this reason, herbal agents and immunotherapy are under investigation as potential alternatives to ADT and its accompanying side effects. New therapeutic options combined with improved imaging to evaluate the disease may markedly change how biochemically recurrent prostate cancer is managed in the future.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).",exclusion,Review,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11864-017-0462-4,,,

A key obstacle is the traditional paradigm in which therapies with significant benefit in mCRPC are then studied in patients (pts) with localized, rising PSA or early metastatic disease using time-to-event (TTE) outcomes (e.g. biochemical recurrence, radiographic progression or death). These trials are costly, lengthy and often give inconclusive results that do not change practice nor provide a methodology to rank regimens based on efficacy. A new strategy is needed that gives a rapid efficacy readout and prioritizes approaches for large-scale testing. Method(s):Metacure is a multi-arm, multi-stage randomized Phase 2 trial in which novel systemic therapies are studied in the context of a multimodality approach, which includes radical prostatectomy + pelvic and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, if applicable, stereotactic radiotherapy (RT) to osseous metastases, and an option for adjuvant RT based on risk factors. The arms include combinations of ADT + apalutamide +/- abiraterone acetate and prednisone. Non-castrate prostate cancer pts with high probability of relapse or death from disease ranging from very high risk localized to low-volume metastatic disease are eligible. The primary endpoint is pathologic complete response and minimal residual disease. The secondary endpoint is undetectable PSA with non-castrate levels of testosterone. Both are binary endpoints that circumvent interpretations of the clinical relevance of TTE outcomes, providing a read-out of success or failure in a shorter time frame with fewer pts. The uniform entry criteria and continuous randomization enables ranking and prioritization of the strategies evaluated for further development in large-scale trials so that only the most effective ones move forward. This multicenter trial is managed by the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium, funded by Janssen and is currently open and actively accruing. Future plans include opening a cohort of pts with aggressive non-castrate disease harboring DNA damage repair alterations.",exclusion,,Llegir per assegurar-me que inclou teràpia amb fàrmacs,,ProP126,,

However, there is a lack of data on surgical MDT in visceral/skeletal oligometastatic prostate cancer (PCa). We aimed to assess the role of surgical excision of visceral and skeletal PCa recurrence. METHODS: Seventeen PCa patients experienced metachronous visceral or skeletal oligometastatic recurrence following maximal local treatment. Oligometastatic recurrence was defined as 1-3 lesions, detected with the best imaging technique available at the time of diagnosis. All patients underwent metastasectomy and were followed for a median of 43 months. Postoperative complications were graded using the Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications. Kaplan-Meier plots were used to assess overall survival. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (82%) had visceral lesions, two had bone lesions (12%), and one had an abdominal wall metastasis (6%). Four patients (24%) were under active ADT at the time of metastasectomy. PSA decreased after metastasectomy in 16 (94%) patients. Ten (77%) of the 13 ADT-naïve patients had a PSA decrease of ≥ 50%. Following metastasectomy, 16 (94.1%) patients developed metastatic recurrence of which 11 (64.7%) were again oligometastatic, amenable for repeated MDT. The median time to metastatic recurrence was 14 months (range 6.4-40). We observed 8% Clavien-Dindo grade 3-4 complications in 21 procedures. CONCLUSIONS: In this report, we analyzed the outcomes of surgical excision of visceral and skeletal PCa recurrence following primary treatment. We found that removing metastasis to the bone and viscera can be associated with long-term disease-free periods at a low rate of serious complications.

The primary aim of this approach is to prolong disease free survival and delay the initiation of systemic therapies. This retrospective study is aimed to analyse local control, biochemical progression-free survival (b-PFS), toxicity and systemic therapy-free survival in a cohort of patients treated by a single clinician. Method(s): Eighteen patients (26 lesions) in patients with relapsed oligometastatic prostate cancer (1-3 sites) were treated with SABR, delivered using both cyberknife and VMAT. Doses used were 24 Gy in 2 or 3 fractions for spine and 30-40 Gy in 3 fractions for lymph nodes and other bony metastases. All patients had either a Choline or PSMA-PET scan prior to treatment. Response was assessed with PSA testing and repeat scanning when feasible. CTCAE acute and late toxicity was prospectively recorded. Result(s): Mean age was 68. Previous treatments for the primary prostate cancer included surgery (7 patients), surgery and salvage prostate bed radiotherapy (6 patients), radical radiotherapy (4 patients) and cryotherapy (1 patient). Twelve patients had a single metastatic site, four patients had 2 sites and two patients had 3 sites. Six patients patients were treated with a short course of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in addition to SABR. All patients had a fall in PSA with a mean reduction of 75%. Median pre-SABR PSA was 1.83ug/L and median post-SABR PSA was 0.28ug/L At a median follow-up of 14 months (range 2-28.5), 14 patients (78%) remained systemic therapy free. Three patients with a single pelvic lymph node metastases achieved a sustained undetectable PSA level. All 8 patients who had a post-treatment PET scan showed no residual activity at the treated site. One patient experienced G2 acute bowel toxicity, otherwise there was no toxicity above G1. Conclusion(s): MDT using SABR for relapsed prostate cancer is a safe treatment with promising results in terms of local control, b-PFS and delaying the initiation of systemic therapies.

A subgroup of those patients with mCRPC presents with oligoprogressive disease, with a limited number of progressive lesions while other metastases are still controlled by ongoing systemic treatment. METHODS: In this single arm prospective phase II trial, we aim to include 18 patients with oligoprogressive mCRPC (1-3 metastases and/or local recurrence) who will be treated with metastasis-directed therapy to all visible progressive lesions. Progression is based on conventional imaging, as the use of PSMA PET-CT is considered investigational. However all patients will undergo PSMA PET-CT and the images will be blinded until progression. Primary endpoint is the postponement of the start of next-line systemic treatment (NEST) and the additional clinical value of PSMA PET-CT. Recruitment of patients for this trial started in January 2020 and will be completed approximately by December 2020. DISCUSSION: In this phase 2 trial on oligoprogressive mCRPC, we will investigate the benefit of progression-directed therapy while continuing ongoing systemic treatment. We hypothesize that progression-directed therapy (PDT) with surgery or stereotactic body radiation therapy for these oligoprogressive lesions will postpone the start of next-line systemic treatment and therefore serve as a new or add-on therapy in the spectrum of treatments available for mCRPC. The results of this trial will serve as guidance for a later randomized phase 3 trial. All participants are given an information sheet and are required to give written informed consent.

Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) has gained momentum as a treatment option for oligometastatic prostate cancer (OPC). We report on a large multi-center cohort of OPC treated by SBRT techniques in the community setting. Method(s): This is an IRB approved retrospective study of men undergoing SBRT for OPC at 32 centers. Cumulatively, 121 men with a median age of 74 years were treated to 188 lesions. The median follow-up was 7.8 months. Most men had received prior androgen deprivation therapy (84%). Systemic therapy included abiraterone (14%), docetaxel-based chemotherapy (13%), Sipuleucel-T (10%), enzalutamide (9%), and Radium 223 (6%). Three percent had undergone surgery and 21% had received prior radiation therapy to bone lesion(s). Technetium-99 bone scan (59%), Na-F18 PET/CT bone scan (23%), and MRI (21%) were commonly used for diagnostic evaluation and/or treatment planning. The spine was the most common radiated site (67%). Fractionation schedules varied but most commonly: 8 Gy x 3 (34%), 5 Gy x 5 (19%), 6 Gy x 5 (10%). Result(s): Prior to SBRT, 83% of patients had clinically significant bone pain. At follow up, 76% noted a significant improvement in pain (p = .02) as their best response post SBRT. Only 2 patients had no pain relief and 1 patient had increased pain. No acute toxicity was reported in 93%; Grade 1-2 esophagitis was the most common side effect (3%). Late toxicity was noted in one case of Grade 1 lung fibrosis. Fractionation scheme or location of the OPC did not appear to influence outcome or morbidity. Conclusion(s): These data suggest SBRT is a well-tolerated treatment option that offers statistically significant, clinically relevant pain control for OPC.

This imaging technique shows areas of enhanced osteoblastic activity and blood flow. In this work, (18)F-NaF PET/CT was investigated for response assessment to single fraction stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) to bone metastases in prostate cancer patients. METHODS: Patients with bone metastases in a prospective trial treated with single fraction SABR received a (18)F-NaF PET/CT scan prior to and 6 months post-SABR. The SUV(max) in the tumour was determined and the difference between before and after SABR determined. The change in uptake in the non-tumour bone was also measured as a function of the received SABR dose. RESULTS: Reduction in SUV(max) was observed in 29 of 33 lesions 6 months after SABR (mean absolute decrease in SUV(max) 17.7, 95% CI 25.8 to - 9.4, p = 0.0001). Of the three lesions with increased SUV(max) post-SABR, two were from the same patient and located in the vertebral column. Both were determined to be local progression in addition to one fracture. The third lesion (in a rib) was shown to be controlled locally but suffered from a fracture at 24 months. Progression adjacent to the treated volume was observed in two patients. The non-tumour bone irradiated showed increased loss in uptake with increasing dose, with a median loss in uptake of 23.3% for bone receiving 24 Gy. CONCLUSION: (18)F-NaF PET/CT for response assessment of bone metastases to single fraction SABR indicates high rates of reduction of osteoblastic activity in the tumour and non-tumour bone receiving high doses. The occurrence of marginal recurrence indicates use of larger clinical target volumes may be warranted in treatment of bone metastases.

Median PSA-PFS of this sub-group was 23.1 months (range 12.1-28.4 months). One local recurrence was observed after 28.4 months resulting in an actuarial 2-year- and 3-year-LCR of 100% and 75%. The time to initiation of ADT in patients treated without ADT was 9.9 months (range 2.6-36.1 months). Including all patients, the time to intensification of systemic therapy or the time to initiation of ADT, respectively, increased from 9.9 to 12.0 months (range 2.6-36.1 months). Gleason-Score, ADT or the localization of metastasis had no impact on PFS or time to intensification of systemic therapy. No SBRT related acute or late toxicities were observed. Conclusion(s): We could show that SBRT of bone metastases is a highly effective therapy with an excellent risk-benefit profile. However, PFS was limited due to a high distant failure rate indicating the difficult patient assessment for this oligometastasis concept. With SBRT, radiation oncology can offer high local cancer control rates in bone oligometastases of prostate cancer and should be evaluated in such specific clinical situation with the aim of curation or to delay conversion of systemic treatment.",exclusion,Other tumor treated (skeletal),,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00066-017-1137-6,,,

To gain data for this approach, we evaluated oligometastasized PC patients receiving stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to bone metastases. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 15 oligometastasized PC patients with a total of 20 bone metastases were evaluated regarding biochemical progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), time to initiation of ADT, and local control rate (LCR). Three patients received concomitant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). RESULTS: The median follow-up after RT was 22.5 months (range 7.0-53.7 months). The median PSA-PFS was 6.9 months (range 1.1-28.4 months). All patients showing a decrease of PSA level after RT of at least factor 10 reveal a PSA-PFS of >12 months. Median PSA-PFS of this sub-group was 23.1 months (range 12.1-28.4 months). Local PFS (LPFS) after 2 years was 100%. One patient developed a local failure after 28.4 months. Median distant PFS (DPFS) was 7.36 months (range 1.74-54.34 months). The time to initiation of ADT in patients treated without ADT was 9.3 months (range 2.6-36.1 months).

random-journal.pdf,ProM113,"Milano, Michael T",2020,eng,5 study;pro.m:#5;pro.p:#5,Oligometastases: history of a hypothesis.,"The term oligometastases represents a clinical state of metastatic disease that is limited in the number of metastatic sites and extent of disease, and amenable to metastasis-directed surgical or ablative therapy. While metastasis-directed approaches are used for palliation, the primary goal of such treatment for patients with oligometastases is to prolong survival and the duration of cancer control. Metastasis-directed therapy, for patients with limited number of metastatic sites, has been practiced for decades, dating back to the era before chemotherapy was widely used. Systemic therapy has become the accepted standard of care for metastatic disease. And while not curative for most solid cancers, systemic therapy can delay cancer progression, prolong life, and maintain or improve quality of life, albeit often at the expense of toxicities which can adversely impact quality of life. From the 1960s to 1980s, prominent physicians questioned whether metastasis-directed resection or radiotherapy could potentially be curative treatment approaches. In 1995, Drs. Hellman and Weichselbaum wrote an editorial that coined the term ""oligometastases"" and refined the hypothesis of metastasis-directed surgical and radiotherapeutic treatments as potentially curative for select patients. Their article was the first to explicitly describe the clinical state of metastases existing along a spectrum, with a spectrum of behaviors (ranging from indolent disease confined to limited sites to widespread disease) and, therefore, a spectrum of potential treatments. In the ensuing decades, there were rapid technologic advancements in radiotherapy, including stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), which facilitated delivery of ablative doses of radiation to precisely and accurately targeted tumors. SBRT has been considered an optimal non-surgical approach to treat oligometastases, allowing for definitive-dose delivery and for targeting accuracy that minimizes normal tissue radiation exposure. In the early 2000s, many institutions began publishing prospective studies demonstrating favorable outcomes in patients with oligometastases treated with SBRT. Not answered in these single-arm studies was whether patients generally fared better than expected due to selection of patients with relatively indolent disease, or from metastasisdirected treatment. There is also a potential for immortal time bias with non-randomized comparisons. However, recent randomized phase II studies have suggested that SBRT for oligometastases is associated with improved survival outcomes. Phase III studies, many specific for certain cancers (i.e., breast, prostate or lung cancers) are accruing. Future work will be needed to identify which patients are most apt to benefit from metastasis-directed therapy; in addition to clinical factors, host and/or tumor genomics may prove to be prognostic. Metastasis-directed therapy may become more important with improvements in systemic therapy in controlling micrometastatic disease. Incorporating immunotherapy with SBRT may also be a promising approach, with SBRT perhaps augmenting the immune response. As personalized medicine evolves, patients with oligometastases will be better served. The history of oligometastases will continue to unfold.",exclusion,review,Llegir text complert per info sobre oligometastasis i referències sobre RCTs,http://dx.doi.org/10.21037/apm.2020.03.31,ProP141,,

We address this issue with prospectively collected progression and treatment data from the TROG 03.04 RADAR randomised controlled trial for men with locally advanced prostate cancer (PC). Methods Three Fine and Gray competing risk survival models with time-dependent covariates were used to determine whether metastatic progression status at first diagnosis of bony metastases, i.e. number of bony sites involved and presence of prior or simultaneous other sites of progression, impacts on prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) when adjusted for baseline prognostic factors and allocated primary treatment. Results Between 2003 and 2014, 176 of the 1071 subjects developed bone metastases, 152 developed other sites of progression and 91 died of PC. All subjects received secondary treatment using androgen suppression but none received extirpative treatments. The three models found evidence: 1 - of a clear prognostic gradient according to number of bony metastatic sites; 2 - that other sites of progression contributed to PCSM to a lesser extent than bone progression; and 3 - that further bony metastatic progression in men with up to 3 bony metastases had a major impact on PCSM. Conclusion Randomised trials are essential to determine the value of extirpative treatment for oligometastatic bony metastases due to PC.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",exclusion,Other tumor treated,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2016.07.021,ProP142,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seven-eight patients were treated with SBRT for isolated body metastasis. The most frequent primary tumor was prostate cancer (28.2%), followed by colorectal cancer (23.1%) and lung cancer (20.5%). Median age at diagnosis of oligometastatic disease was 70 years (range 47-88). Median Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) was 90 (range 70-100). The most common SBRT fractionation scheme was 5 _ 7 Gy (total dose 35 Gy). Response to radiotherapy was determined according to RECIST criteria v1.1. Toxicity was registered according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. The survival analysis was performed with the Kaplan-Meier method. The correlation between time actuarial incidence and clinical parameters was studied, and the Kaplan-Meier method of log-rank test was applied. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 22.68 months, local control was achieved in 89.7% of the cases. The two-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 68% and 42%, respectively. On univariate analysis, KPS ≥80 is predictive for improved OS (p = .001) and PFS (p = .001). Acute toxicity of grade ≥2 occurred in eight (10.2%) patients and late grade ≥2 toxicity in five (6.4%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ablative radiotherapy in 'early oligometastatic state' is a safe, effective and minimally invasive treatment modality. A good performance status (KPS ≥80) seems to influence the clinical outcome.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,10.1080/0284186X.2017.1346383,ProP143,,

Methods Review of Electronic Health Records and medical literature Results A 46-year old presented with pain in her right axilla. She was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) in 2008 treated with surgery (SRG), radiation (XRT) and chemotherapy (CTX). She recurred in the axilla in 2014 treated with SRG and CTX, in the chest wall in 2016 treated with CTX and XRT and with an unresectable chest wall mass in 2018. Due to prior XRT she was considered at high risk for tissue necrosis with additional XRT. She received chest wall cryoablation (CAB) x 2 with symptom resolution. Pain remained under control for 8 months. Metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) is an incurable disease. CTX is the cornerstone of treatment with goals of improving survival and palliation. Median survival (MS) is 2 years. Second line CTX has modest activity with response <20% and time to tumor progression <6 months. XRT and SRG are reserved for symptomatic or non-responsive disease. OGM cancer is an emerging concept, in which some metastatic tumors remain locoregionally confined while others are widely disseminated. It was not until recently that this concept is taking more relevance. RNA analysis shows that oligo- and poly- metastases are distinct entities. OGM tumors may benefit from LRT which include stereotactic body radiation (SBRT), minimally invasive SRG or ablation. Ablation may be achieved by heat (radiofrequency, microwave and laser), or by the use of CAB which cools tissue to <-40degreeC producing tissue necrosis. CAB can be used in the treatment of bone lesions, renal masses, lung, prostate and breast tumors. Recent data supports the use of LRT in patients with OGM cancer. The SABR-COMET phase II randomized trial reported a MS of 28 months for systemic therapy alone vs 41 months with the addition of SBRT (Lancet 2019). A phase II/III trial is underway in OGM breast cancer. Conclusions This case is an example of OGM TNBC with survival >6 years. The use of local therapies probably contributed to her survival. This case also exemplifies the value of CAB in treating recurrent tumors, particularly when other techniques, such as SRG or XRT are not appropriate.",exclusion,Case-report,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jim-2020-SRM.201,,,
random-journal.pdf,ProM117,"C., Artigas",2017,English,pro.m,Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer radiotherapy treatment based on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT: preliminary results,"Introduction and Aim: Oligometastatic disease in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) biochemical relapse (BCR) after primary treatment with curative intent is defined as the presence of up to 3 metastatic sites. Treating those lesions with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has been demonstrated to increase disease free survival in a safe way, delaying androgen deprivation therapy for more than 2 years. However, those studies have been performed staging patients with Choline-PET. Our hypothesis is that these results can be improved using 68Ga-PSMA PET/ CT, which has demonstrated better accuracy in patients with BCR at low PSA levels, where the probability of oligometastatic disease is higher . The aim of this communication was to assess the efficacy of SBRT based on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in patients with BCR. Material(s) and Method(s): This is a retrospective analysis of a monocentric cohort of PCa patients diagnosed with oligometastatic disease based on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT findings and treated with RT. Inclusion criteria were: histologically proven PCa, BCR after local treatment with curative intent (surgery, radiotherapy or both) and 3 or less metastatic lesions. Number and localization of metastatic sites where registered. MRI and CT coregistration were used for SBRT planning. In order to evaluate its efficacy , biochemical response was defined as a decrease of >50% of PSA (PSA50) measured at 1 and 4 months after SBRT. Patients were followed-up until progression. Result(s): From a total cohort of 45 patients treated with RT based on 68Ga -PSMA PET/ CT results, 15 met the inclusion criteria. Median PSA value at the time of the scan was 2.06ng/ml. A total of 22 PSMA positive lesions were treated: 13/22 (59%) lymph nodes, 6/22 (27%) bone lesions and 3/22 (14%) lung lesions. Only 1/15 (7%) patients had a biochemical response (PSA50) at 1 month while 8/11 (73%) patients presented a biochemical response at 4 months of follow- up . At the moment of this communication 4 patients are still responding at 1 year follow-up with no androgen deprivation therapy needed. Conclusion(s): Retrospective study preliminary results suggest SBRT based on 68Ga -PSMA PET/CT to be an effective treatment in patients with PCa oligometastatic disease. Biochemical response seems to be uncomplete at 1 month and should therefore be evaluated at earliest 4 months after SBRT. Future studies measuring outcome of SBRT based on 68Ga -PSMA PET/CT should be confronted to those using other imaging techniques.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00259-017-3822-1,ProP144,,

Aim of this study is to report long-term results of ENRT in PCa patients (pts) with oligorecurrent nodal disease after primary treatment. Material and Methods Data of 53 oligorecurrent PCa pts (N1 and/or M1a) with <= 5 nodal metastases (n=108) treated with ENRT combined with androgen deprivation (AD) between 2004 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Median age and PSA at diagnosis were 62 yrs (range, 47-77) and 8.6 ng/ml (range, 3.4-92.9 ng/ml), respectively. The primary treatment was RT, radical prostatectomy (RP), RP + postoperative RT and RT + salvage RP in 9 (17%), 23 (43%), 20 (38%) and 1 (2%) pts, respectively. At recurrence (median time after primary treatment of 34 mo, range 2-129 mo), all but one patient were re-staged with 18F-choline PET-CT studies. Median PSA and PSA doubling time (DT) were 3.4 ng/ml (0.2-48.9 ng/ml) and 5 mo (range, 1-35 mo), respectively. At restaging, 45.3% (n=24) of the pts presented a single nodal metastasis, while 2, 3, 4 and 5 nodal metastases were found in 30% (n=16), 7.5% (n=4), 9.5% (n=5) and 7.5% (n=4) of the pts, respectively. Recurrences were mainly located in the pelvis (n=38). A combined N1 and M1a oligorecurrence or extrapelvic nodal progression (M1a) was observed in 10 and 5 pts, respectively. All pts underwent ENRT between 45 and 50.4 Gy with a boost on positive nodes (median 64.4 Gy, 54-69 Gy) using mainly VMAT (n=24) or IMRT (n=21) techniques. Concomitant AD was administered to all pts for a median time of 6mo (range, 3-30 mo). Results After a median follow-up (FU) after ENRT of 44 mo (range, 2-133), 27 pts (51%) showed PSA progression, with a 5-yr biochemical disease free-survival of 43+/-8.3%. The 5-yr distant progression-free survival (DPFS) rate was 58.2+/-8.5% (n=19 pts with clinical progression). Pts with a PSA DT at relapse <3 mo showed a worse 5-yr DPFS compared to pts with a PSA DT >= 3mo (36.8% vs. 63.6%, p=0.029), while a trend towards significance was observed for pts with 1 vs >= 2 recurrent nodes (71.8% vs. 44.9%, p=0.089). Overall survival rate at 5-yr was 86.4+/-6.9% (2 over 4 pts died from PCa). Ten of 19 clinically relapsing pts presented a new oligometastatic progression (7 nodal/2 bone/1 combined). One patient presented a local relapse in the previously untreated prostate bed. Eight out 10 pts were treated with a new RT course, with 3 pts in complete remission at last FU. Only 2 pts presented with a CTCAE v3.0 Grade >=2 genitourinary toxicity. Conclusion ENRT combined with concomitant short-course AD is a safe and effective salvage modality for patients with oligorecurrent nodal PCa, able to better delay distant progression compared to historical series using focal SBRT.

One of the key aims of the audit was to assess the configuration and availability of specialist prostate cancer services in England. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2014, the NPCA undertook an organisational survey of all 143 acute National Health Service (NHS) Trusts and 48 specialist multidisciplinary team (MDT) hubs cross England. Questionnaires established the availability and location of core diagnostic, treatment and patient-centred support services for the management of non-metastatic prostate cancer in addition to specific diagnostic and treatment procedures that reflect the continuing evolution of prostate cancer management, such as high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and stereotactic body radiotherapy. RESULTS: The survey received a 100% response rate. The results showed considerable geographical variation with respect to the availability of core treatment modalities, the size of the target population and catchment areas served by specialist MDT hubs, as well as in the uptake of additional procedures and services. Specifically there are gaps in the availability of core radiotherapy procedures; high dose rate and low dose rate brachytherapy are available in 44% and 75% of specialist MDTs, respectively. By comparison, there seems to be a relative 'over-penetration' of surgical innovation, with 67% of specialist MDTs providing robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy and 21% HIFU. There is also evidence of increased centralisation of core surgical procedures and regional inequity in the availability of surgical innovation across England. CONCLUSIONS: The organisational survey of the NPCA has provided a comprehensive assessment of the structure and function of specialist MDTs in England and the availability of prostate cancer procedures and services. As part of the prospective audit, the NPCA will assess the effect of the availability of prostate cancer services on access regionally and subsequent outcomes of care according to evidence-based guidelines.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,Survey on treatments used,10.1016/j.clon.2016.02.004,,,

Objective(s): To determine if stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) improves oncologic outcomes in men with oligometastatic prostate cancer. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): The Observation vs Stereotactic Ablative Radiation for Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer (ORIOLE) phase 2 randomized study accrued participants from 3 US radiation treatment facilities affiliated with a university hospital from May 2016 to March 2018 with a data cutoff date of May 20, 2019, for analysis. Of 80 men screened, 54 men with recurrent hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and 1 to 3 metastases detectable by conventional imaging who had not received ADT within 6 months of enrollment or 3 or more years total were randomized. Intervention(s): Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive SABR or observation. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was progression at 6 months by prostate-specific antigen level increase, progression detected by conventional imaging, symptomatic progression, ADT initiation for any reason, or death. Predefined secondary outcomes were toxic effects of SABR, local control at 6 months with SABR, progression-free survival, Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form)-measured quality of life, and concordance between conventional imaging and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-Targeted positron emission tomography in the identification of metastatic disease. Result(s): In the 54 men randomized, the median (range) age was 68 (61-70) years for patients allocated to SABR and 68 (64-76) years for those allocated to observation. Progression at 6 months occurred in 7 of 36 patients (19%) receiving SABR and 11 of 18 patients (61%) undergoing observation (P =.005). Treatment with SABR improved median progression-free survival (not reached vs 5.8 months; hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11-0.81; P =.002). Total consolidation of PSMA radiotracer-Avid disease decreased the risk of new lesions at 6 months (16% vs 63%; P =.006). No toxic effects of grade 3 or greater were observed. T-cell receptor sequencing identified significant increased clonotypic expansion following SABR and correlation between baseline clonality and progression with SABR only (0.082085 vs 0.026051; P =.03). Conclusions and Relevance: Treatment with SABR for oligometastatic prostate cancer improved outcomes and was enhanced by total consolidation of disease identified by PSMA-Targeted positron emission tomography. SABR induced a systemic immune response, and baseline immune phenotype and tumor mutation status may predict the benefit from SABR. These results underline the importance of prospective randomized investigation of the oligometastatic state with integrated imaging and biological correlates.

The aim of this study is to report in a prospective cohort of oligorecurrent prostate cancer patients factors associated with the pattern of relapse and disease control after MDT. Material(s) and Method(s): From 2012 to 2017, 104 lesions diagnosed with Ch-PET in 53 consecutive oligometastatic-recurrence prostate cancer patients have been treated. Biochemical failure was defined using the nadir+2 ng/mL definition; a DFS event was defined as evidence of disease by any clinical, pathological or radiological method. Reassessment with Ch-PET imaging was performed in case of biochemical failure or if clinically indicated to rule out local or distant metastatic progression. Patterns of first progression following MDT were recorded. In case of an oligometastatic recurrence outside the previous PTV field, a retreatment with SBRT or IMRT was offered. Descriptive analyses were done. Chi-square and Fisher-exact tests were performed to evaluate the influence of patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics on the pattern of relapse.

After a median follow-up of 28 months (6-54 months), 89% of the patients remain alive and only 3 deaths were related to prostate cancer. At last follow-up 34% of the patients were free from disease progression. Twenty-five patients with biochemical failure after 1st MDT presented distant recurrence on re-staging Ch-PET and 64% (16/25) were again oligometastatic relapses allowing for a 2nd MDT in 12 patients. In terms of relapse site, 7/7 (100%) patients with initial bone disease presented a subsequent bone relapse, 10/18 (56%) patients with initial nodal disease presented a nodal relapse and 8/18 (44%) a bone relapse. At diagnosis, a PSA pre-PET<4.5ng/mL was associated with higher probability of presenting with nodal oligometastases (p=0.049). The variables with significant association with nodal relapse after MDT were a pre-MDT PSA<10ng/mL (p=0.049) and initial nodal oligometastatic site (p=0.02). A PSADT>12 months before MDT was the only factor statistically associated with higher disease control (p=0.011). Conclusion(s): Long-term disease control is still possible in oligometastatic patients who receive MDT. At relapse, most patients are again oligometastatic allowing for repeated MDT. The pre-MDT PSA and initial nodal oligometastatic site are associated with a further nodal relapse. Patients presenting with a PSADT>12 months and a PSApre-PET<4.5ng/mL may have a better prognosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,Prognostic factors,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0167-8140%2819%2931269-1,,,

At this moment, there are no specific treatment recommendations for patients with limited nodal recurrences and different locoregional treatment approaches are currently being used, mostly by means of metastasis-directed therapies (MDT): salvage lymph node dissection (sLND) or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Since the majority of patients treated with MDT relapse within 2 years in adjacent lymph node regions, with an estimated median time to progression of 12-18 months, combining MDT with whole pelvic radiotherapy (WPRT) may improve oncological outcomes in these patients. The aim of this prospective multicentre randomized controlled phase II trial is to assess the impact of the addition of WPRT to MDT and short-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on metastasis-free survival (MFS) in the setting of oligorecurrent pelvic nodal recurrence. METHODS & DESIGN: Patients diagnosed with PET-detected pelvic nodal oligorecurrence (≤5 nodes) following radical local treatment for PCa, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio between arm A: MDT and 6 months of ADT, or arm B: WPRT added to MDT and 6 months of ADT. Patients will be stratified by type of PET-tracer (choline, FACBC or PSMA) and by type of MDT (sLND or SBRT). The primary endpoint is MFS and the secondary endpoints include clinical and biochemical progression-free survival (PFS), prostate cancer specific survival, quality of life (QoL), toxicity and time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and to palliative ADT. Estimated study completion: December 31, 2023. DISCUSSION: This is the first prospective multicentre randomized phase II trial assessing the potential of combined WPRT and MDT as compared to MDT alone on MFS for patients with nodal oligorecurrent PCa.

Regional nodal recurrence is an emerging clinical situation since the introduction of new molecular imaging methods in the restaging of recurrent prostate cancer. More specifically, a subgroup of these patients is being diagnosed with a recurrence confined to the regional lymph nodes and limited in number (oligorecurrence) using choline or PSMA PET-CT. As there are no specific treatment recommendations for these type of patients, different treatment approaches are currently used, mostly focusing on local ablative treatments using radiotherapy or surgery. These treatments are coined metastasisdirected therapy (MDT). MDT in combination with or without temporary ADT could delay the subsequent risk of progression, and even cure limited regional nodal recurrences. Consequently, lifelong palliative ADT, with its toxicity and excess in non-cancer mortality might be postponed.random-journal.pdf,

We conducted a clinical trial of stereotactic hypofractionated radiotherapy delivered in once-weekly fractions on patients with non-metastatic disease to test feasibility, acute toxicities, patient reported outcomes, and biochemical control in a cohort with predominantly high-risk disease. Purpose/Objective(s): Patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason 6-10, T1-4N0 (staged with multiparametric MRI and bone scans) and PSA <=60 ng/ml were eligible for enrolment into this Phase I/II trial. A planned sample of 30 patients were treated with volumetric intensity modulated arc radiation therapy to a dose of 35 Gy in 5 fractions delivered once-weekly with an overall treatment time of 29 days. Patients with high-risk disease also received elective nodal irradiation to a dose of 25 Gy in 5 fractions simultaneously. Androgen deprivation was offered to intermediate and high risk patients. Trial specific dose constraints were ensured. The primary outcome was acute toxicity with NCI CTC v4. Secondary outcome measures included biochemical control and late toxicity. Patient reported outcomes were measured with the IPSS score and EORTC QLQ-C30 and PR25 questionnaires. Clinically meaningful worsening of quality of life scores was defined as a 10 point reduction (out of 100) in any scale. Result(s): All 30 patients completed treatment per-protocol. The majority of patients had T3 (60%) and Gleason 7 (50%) tumors. The median PSA was 17 ng/ml. High risk disease was present in 20 patients (66.7%). There was low incidence of acute toxicities (Grade 2+ urinary toxicities in 1-3.3%, and grade 2+ rectal toxicities in none). The mean IPSS scores increased from baseline 8.6 to 14.6 at the end of treatment (P < 0.001) but reduced to 10.9 at 6 months (P = 0.05). Of the 21 parameters studied in the EORTC QLQ framework, only the urinary symptom score showed a clinically meaningful worsening from a mean of 20/100 at baseline to 34/100 at end of treatment (P < 0.001), but reduced to 24/100 at 6 months (P = 0.08). Other functional or symptomatic scales did not show any clinically meaningful worsening. There was 1 patient each with late grade 2 rectal bleeding and grade 2 urinary toxicity. With a median follow-up of 25 months, 1 patient developed a distant failure at 10 months, with a 2 year biochemical control rate of 96.7%. Conclusion(s): In a cohort of mainly high risk cancers in a developing country, stereotactic once-weekly radiation therapy was easy to implement, safe and well tolerated with a low incidence of acute toxicity.

Usually, prostate SBRT has been delivered every other day in order to favor normal tissues recovery, minimizing side effects. Flattening Filter Free (FFF) delivery is a treatment modality able to reduce treatment beam-on time, decreasing patient positioning uncertainties. Aim of the present phase-II study is to evaluate the feasibility, side effects and biochemical control of FFF SBRT delivered in 5 consecutive days in a cohort of localized PC patients. Purpose/Objective(s): The study, approved by Ethical Committee, started on January 2014. Inclusion criteria were: age <= 80 years, World Health Organization performance status <= 2, histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma, low-intermediate risk according to D'Amico criteria, no distant metastases, no previous surgery other than TURP, no other malignant tumor in the previous 5 years, a pre-SBRT International Prostatic Symptoms Score (IPSS) ranged between 0 and 7. The SBRT-schedule was 35Gy for low risk and 37.5Gy for intermediate risk PC in 5 fractions, delivered in 5 consecutive days. SBRT was delivered with volumetric modulated radiation therapy (VMAT) and Image-guidance by Cone beam Computed tomography. Toxicity assessment was performed according to CTCAE v4.0 scale. Neoadjuvant/concomitant hormonal-therapy was prescribed according to risk classification. Result(s): At the time of the analysis, forty-two patients were recruited in the protocol and treated. Median age was 74 years (63-80 years), Median follow-up was 22 months (range: 15-34 months). According to risk-category, 31/42 patients were low-risk and 11/42 were intermediate risk. Median initial PSA was 6.1 ng/ml (range, 3.4-12.8 ng/ml). Median Gleason Score was 6 (6-7). IPSS pre-SBRT was registered for all patients, with a median value of 4 (range, 0-10).

Materials/Methods: Patients with non-metastatic (M0) unfavorable intermediate, high-risk, or N1 prostate cancer underwent SBRT, 24 Gy in 3 fractions (an EQD2 of 60 Gy for an alpha/beta ratio of 2) directed to the prostate and seminal vesicles delivered over five days, two weeks neoadjuvant to radical prostatectomy in a prospective Phase I clinical trial. Feasibility was defined as the percent of patients successfully undergoing radical prostatectomy as scheduled without acute surgical complications. Physician reported toxicity was assessed by CTCAEv4 criteria and patient reported toxicity by EPIC and IPSS questionnaires. Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy was allowed. Patients who were N1 additionally underwent androgen deprivation concurrent with IMRT directed to the pelvic nodes subsequent to surgery. Result(s): Ten patients enrolled and all successfully completed SBRT and radical prostatectomy without any acute surgical complications. Median follow-up was 10 months. Three patients had Grade 2 incontinence and one had Grade 3 incontinence and ultimately underwent successful placement of an artificial sphincter with return of urinary continence. There were no Grade 2 or higher GI toxicities. One patient was on androgen deprivation prior to the SBRT that was continued through radical prostatectomy. Pre-treatment biopsies and irradiated, resected malignant prostates allow for correlative analyses that investigate acute changes to tumor tissue and infiltrating immune cell subsets after SBRT.

However, stereotactic hypofractionated radiotherapy (SRT) has been investigated primarily in highly selected patient populations with lowintermediate risk disease. We performed a clinical trial of SRT delivered in once-weekly fractions on an unselected cohort of patients with non-metastatic PrCa. Method(s): In this Phase I/II study 30 patients with non-metastatic PrCa (multiparametric MRI cT1-4N0, M0, Gleason 6- 10, PSA < = 60 ng/ml) were treated with SRT to a prescription dose of 35Gy in 5 fractions delivered once a week (overall treatment time 29 days). Elective nodal RT at 25Gy/5Fr was delivered in patients high-risk by NCCN criteria, and androgen deprivation therapy given to intermediate and high-risk patients. SRT was planned using volumetric intensity modulated arc therapy (VMAT) or Helical Tomotherapy (HT) with predefined dose-criteria. The primary endpoint was acute toxicity NCI CTC v4, and secondary endpoints were biochemical control and late toxicity. Result(s): Thirty patients completed treatment per-protocol. Stage T3, Gleason 8-10, and PSA > 10 was seen in 18 (60%), 7 (23%) and 24 (80%) respectively. Overall 20 (66.7%) were high-risk. Median of Mean PTV dose was 36Gy, and normal tissue constraints could be met in all patients (Table). Acute urinary toxicities (Gr 0: 1; Gr 1: 27; Gr 2: 1; Gr 3-4: 0) and acute rectal toxicities (Gr 0: 20; Gr 1: 10; Gr 2: 0; Gr 3-4: 0) were very modest.

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) represents an effective treatment but no consensus exists regarding dose and fractionation. Aim of this trial was to evaluate safety and efficacy of high-dose SBRT. We included patients with 1 to 3 lymph node metastases. Primary end-point was safety, while secondary end-points were in-field local control (LC), out-field lymph nodal progression free survival (LPFS), distant metastasis free survival (DMFS), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). 64 lesions in 52 patients were treated from 2015 to 2019.

Inclusion criteria included: time from primary treatment to biochemical recurrence > 1 year and PSA doubling time> 2 months. A minimum of 24 months of LhRh analogues from the time of the enrollment was required. In HS patients, its withdrawal can be considered after two years of treatment if biochemical control is achieved. Local control rates, biochemical control rates and progression free survival were assessed. Toxicity was prospectively evaluated according to CTCAE.4 criteria. Previous or concomitant treatment with chemotherapy, abiraterone or enzalutamide was not allowed. Result(s): From 07/2014 to 12/2018, 81 patients from 14 Spanish centers were recruited with a total of 117 oligometastases treated, 67 in lymph nodes, 43 in non-spinal bones and 7 in spinal bones. Fourteen patients had CRPC. With a median follow-up after SBRT of 22 months, (range 4,2-48,9 months) local control was 100% and biochemical control was 97,5%. Median Progression free survival was 36,4 months (IC95%= 32,3 - 40,5). 14 patients (17,3%) presented distant disease progression, 4 of them were CRPC. Seven of those 14 patients who relapsed were treated again with SBRT at that time. Specifically, in patients with CRPC, with a median follow-up after SBRT of 24,1 months (range 4,2 -48,9), the median PFS was 26,3 months, (range 17,3-35,3 months). 10 of the 14 CRPC patients (71%) are free from disease progression at last follow-up without the need to start second generation hormonal treatment or chemotherapy. Tolerance and toxicity profiles were excellent, none of the patients developed toxicity >=G3 or symptoms related to local progression of the disease. Conclusion(s): These results indicate that the combination of SBRT and HT is a safe treatment approach with encouraging local and biochemical control in hormone-sensitive and in castration-resistant prostate cancer.Copyright © 2019",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.06.155,ProP174,,

random-journal.pdf,ProM138,"C., Franzese",2019,English,pro.m,Phase II trial of stereotactic body radiation therapy for abdomino-pelvic lymph node oligometastases,"Purpose or Objective: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is nowadays considered an effective approach for the management of oligometastatic patients. Few data exist on radiotherapy in the context of isolated or limited lymph node metastases. We analyzed clinical results of oligometastatic patients treated with high dose SBRT for lymph node metastases in abdomen and pelvis. Material(s) and Method(s): This is a prospective, phase 2 trial. Primary end-point was the assessment of acute and late toxicity; secondary endpoints were local control (LC), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) The schedule of SBRT was 48 Gy delivered in 4 fractions of 12 Gy each. Inclusion criteria were: Histologically-proven carcinoma of gastro-intestinal, genito-urinary of gynecological primary site, WHO performance status <= 2, maximum 3 lymph node sites of disease, maximum diameter <= 5 cm, abdomen-pelvic site. Physical examinations and toxicity assessments were performed during and after SBRT according to CTCAE v4.0. Tumour response was evaluated on CT-MRI-PET scans using the RECIST modified criteria. Result(s): From 2015 to 2018, 41 patients with 52 lymph nodes were enrolled. Median age was 69.2 years and 87.8% of patients were male. Most common primary tumour was located in genito-urinary tract (70.7%), and in particular prostate adenocarcinoma (58.%%), followed by gastro-intestinal (26.8%) and gynecological (2.5%) disease. One single lymph node was treated 32 patients, while 2 and 3 lymph node in 7 and 2 patients, respectively. Systemic therapy was administered before SBRT in 43.9% of patients and during SBRT in 14.6%. Median clinical target volume diameter was 15 mm (6 - 49). With a median follow-up of 16.7 months, only 3 patients reported grade 1 acute toxicity, in the form of pain, dysuria and fatigue. In the late setting, chronic pain was observed in 1 patient. In-field progression was observed in 5 (12.2%) patients with a 1- and 2- years rate of 96.4% and 77.1%. Systemic therapy during SBRT was associated with worse LC (HR 8.6, 95%CI 1.41 - 52.7, p=0.020). Out-field lymphnodal progression was observed in 17 (41.4%) of cases and distant progressions in 8 (19.5%) cases. Median PFS was 12.8 months. At time of analysis all patients were alive except one with 1- and 2-years OS of 100% and 94.7%. Conclusion(s): Treatment of lymph node metastases with high dose SBRT can be considered a safe option with high rates of local control in the context of multidisciplinary management of oligometastatic patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",exclusion,Other tumor treated,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0167-8140%2819%2931303-9,ProP176,,
random-journal.pdf,ProM139,"C., Greco",2019,English,1 population;pro.m,Phenotype-Oriented Ablation of Oligometastatic Cancer with Single Dose Radiation Therapy,"Purpose: The current oligometastatic (OM) model postulates that the disease evolves dynamically with sequential emergence of OM (SOM) lesions requiring successive rounds of SOM ablation to afford tumor cure. The present phase 2 study explores the ablative efficacy of 24 Gy single-dose radiation therapy (SDRT), its feasibility in diverse OM settings, and the impact of radioablation on polymetastatic (PM) dissemination. Methods and Materials: One hundred seventy-five consecutive patients with 566 OM or SOM lesions underwent periodic positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging to stage the disease before treatment, determine tumor response, and monitor timing of PM conversion after SDRT. When 24 Gy SDRT was restricted by dose or volume constraints of serial normal organs, radioablation was diverted to a nontoxic 3x9 Gy SBRT schedule. Result(s): SOM/SOMA occurred in 42% of the patients, and 24 Gy SDRT was feasible in 76% of the lesions. Despite 92% actuarial 5-year OM ablation by 24 Gy SDRT, respective PM-free survival (PMFS) was 26%, indicating PM conversion dominates over effective OM radioablation in many patients. Multivariate analysis of OM metrics derived from staging PET/CT scanning before first treatment predicted PMFS outcome after SDRT. Bivariate analysis of dichotomized high versus low baseline metric combinations of CT-derived tumor load (cutoff at 14.8 cm3) and PET-derived metabolic SUVmax (cutoff at 6.5) yielded a 3-tiered PMFS categorization of 89%, 58% and 17% actuarial 5-year PMFS in categories 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P < .001), defining OM disease as a syndrome of diverse clinical and prognostic phenotypes. Conclusion(s): Long-term risk of PM dissemination, predicted by preablation PET/CT staging, provides guidelines for phenotype-oriented OM therapy. In categories 1 and 2, radioablation should be a primary therapeutic element when pursuing tumor cure, whereas in the PM-prone category 3, radioablation should be a component of multimodal trials addressing primarily the risk of PM dissemination. PET/CT baseline staging also provides a platform for discovery of pharmacologically accessible PM drivers as targets for new phenotype-oriented treatment protocols.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",exclusion,Other study design (phase I/II),,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.02.033,ProP179,,
random-journal.pdf,ProM140,"R., Olson",2019,English,pro.m,Population-based Phase II Trial of Stereotactic Radiotherapy for up to 5 Oligometastases: SABR-5,"Purpose or Objective: Oligometastases refer to a state of disease where cancer has spread beyond the primary site, but is not yet widely metastatic, often defined as 1-3 or 1-5 metastases in number. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is an emerging radiotherapy technique to treat oligometastases that require further prospective population-based toxicity estimates. Material(s) and Method(s): This is a non-randomized phase II trial in a setting where SABR for oligometastases is not available off clinical trial. All participants receive SABR treatment to all sites of newly diagnosed or progressing oligometastatic disease. We have accrued 150 of a planned 200 patients to assess toxicity associated with this experimental treatment. The study was powered to give a 95% confidence on the risk of late grade 4 toxicity, anticipating a < 5% rate of grade 4 toxicity. Result(s): We have accrued 150 patients within 18 months, and anticipate completion of study accrual by December 2018. The majority (65%) had a solitary metastasis, followed by 26%, 7%, and only 2% who had 2,3, or 4-5 metastases, respectively. Within the 150 patients, 220 metastases were treated, with the most common locations being lung (35%), non-spine bone (24%), spine (21%), lymph nodes (9%), and liver (7%). The majority of primary tumour sites were prostate (27%), colorectal (21%), breast (11%), renal cell carcinoma (11%), and head and neck cancer (9%). To date, no SABR related deaths have occurred, but there has been 1 grade 4 serious adverse event related to SABR reported (biliary duct stenosis resulting in jaundice). Updated adverse event rates will be presented. Conclusion(s): SABR treatment of oligometastases is occurring off-trial at a high rate, without sufficient evidence of its efficacy or toxicity.

METHODS: Single-institution retrospective analysis of patients presenting with 1-3 lymph node (LN) recurrences (N1 or M1a) on 18F-Choline PET/CT. Prior therapy included radical prostatectomy (RP) ± salvage radiotherapy (RT), in absence of any systemic therapy. Outcome parameters were biochemical response (BR), time to biochemical recurrence (TBR) and time interval between SBRT and androgen deprivation therapy start (TADT). Time to event endpoints was analysed using Kaplan-Meier method. Potential prognostic factors were examined using univariate proportional hazards regression for TADT and logistic regression for BR. The optimal cut-off point for LN size was calculated using the Contal and O'Quigley method. RESULTS: 25 patients fulfilling study criteria were treated with SBRT from January 2010 to January 2015 and retrospectively analysed. Median follow up was 18 months and median LN diameter 10.5 mm. SBRT was delivered to a median dose of 36 Gy in three fractions (range: 30-45 Gy). BR was reached in 52% of cases. Median TBR was 11.9 months and significantly longer in patients with larger LN (Hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87, P = 0.03). Using 14 mm as cut off for LN, median TBR was 10.8 months for patients with small LN (18 patients), and 21.2 months for patients with large LN (6 patients) (P unadjusted = 0.009; P adjusted = 0.099). ADT was started in 32% of patients after a median follow-up of 18 months. CONCLUSIONS: For PCa patients with 1-3 LN recurrence after RP (± salvage RT), SBRT might result in a better biochemical control when delivered to larger sized (≥ 14 mm) LN metastases.

random-journal.pdf,ProM142,"Guo, Marissa",2018,eng,1 population;pro.m,Predominance of Spinal Metastases Involving the Posterior Vertebral Body.,"BACKGROUND: Spinal metastases pose significant morbidity. For many histologies, the spine is a frequent site for bone metastases. This predilection is not fully understood, and there are conflicting reports regarding the distribution within the vertebral body itself. Knowing this distribution will give clues as to the underlying biologic reason for this increased incidence in the spine and lead to a better understanding of tumor dispersion and growth. METHODS: We retrospectively examined magnetic resonance imaging scans of patients undergoing radiation to the spine from 2015 to 2017 for spinal metastases. The anatomical distribution of lesions was categorized. Lesions were sorted along the sagittal plane into 5 groups: anterior only, anterior + middle, middle only, posterior + middle, and posterior only. Lesions that covered all groups were discarded. _(2) and post-hoc analyses were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Three hundred metastatic lesions were examined in 89 patients; 203 lesions were used for analysis. Sixty-five percent of all lesions were found in posterior only and posterior + middle aspects of the vertebral body (P < 0.0001). This localization was significant regardless of histology: lung (67%, P < 0.0001), kidney (66%, P < 0.0001), sarcoma (67%, P < 0.0001), prostate (63%, P = 0.01), and breast (63%, P = 0.01). This was consistent across thoracic (n = 96) and lumbar (n = 63) regions (72% and 64%, respectively, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Metastatic lesions of the thoracolumbar spine have a greater propensity to localize to the posterior aspect of the vertebral body. These data support the hypothesis that there may be differences within the vertebral body leading to differential tumor dispersion and growth.",exclusion,Other tumor treated (spinal),,10.1016/j.wneu.2018.08.029,,,

Most recurrences in this scenario are characterized by continuous PSA rises and failure of standard imaging (bone scan [BS] and computed tomography [CT]) to detect recurrence sites. We conducted a phase II trial for men with rising PSA after MLT using 18F-DCFPyL PET-MR followed by targeted ablation of PET positive foci. We report the results of our pre-defined analysis. Method(s): Patients with rising PSA (0.43.0 ng/mL) after MLT, negative BS/CT and no prior salvage ADT were eligible. All patients underwent 18F-DCFPyL PET-MR followed by immediate PET-CT acquisition. Those with limited disease, where possible, underwent stereotactic ablative RT (SABR) or surgery. No ADT was used. The primary endpoint was biochemical response rate (complete [undetectable PSA] or partial [PSA decline >50% compared to baseline]). A Simon's two stage study design was employed. Stage 1 included 12 response evaluable patients, requiring 1 or more responses in the absence of grade 3+ toxicities to proceed to stage 2 (additional 25 response evaluable patients). Result(s): After a median of 58 months (range 29-120) post MLT, 20 patients underwent PET-MR/CT to have 12 response evaluable patients. Median PSA at enrollment was 1.3 ng/mL (range 0.4-2.8). Three patients had negative PET-MR/CT, while 17 had positive scans, of which 12 (60%) were amenable to response evaluable ablation. The median number of detected lesions in those treated was 2 (range 1-5). Ten patients underwent SABR (27-30 Gy/3 fractions) and 2 had surgery. One patient (8%) had complete and 4 (33%) had partial PSA responses at a median of 3.3 months (range 2.8-6.0) after ablation, while the remaining 7 (59%) did not have biochemical response. No grade 3+ toxicities were observed. Conclusion(s): 18F-DCFPyL PET/MR has high detection rates in men with rising PSA after MLT. We observed favorable early results with SABR or surgery (41% RR). Trial completion will inform if this approach offers potential for cure in an early molecularly-defined PC oligometastatic state.",exclusion,Other study design (phase I/II),,,ProP185,,

The latter is a clinical situation where a limited number of metastatic tumor sites progress (usually defined as <3-5), while all other metastases are controlled by a given systemic therapy. The frequency of oligoprogression amenable to SABR is unknown. Method(s): Thus, in a retrospective chart analysis we studied the progression pattern of 35 men with chemotherapynaive mCRPC undergoing AA therapy, and of 20 men undergoing AA therapy after docetaxel chemotherapy. Applying RECIST1.1 and/or PCWG2 criteria, patients (pts) were considered SABR candidates if they radiologically progressed in <5 distinct metastatic locations, while all other sites were stable or responding. Result(s): In chemotherapy-naive men, pre-AA metastatic lesions were located in bone (94%), lymph nodes (49%), lungs (17%) and liver (3%), whereas progression during AA therapy occurred in bone (89%), lymph nodes (49%), lungs (14%) and liver (9%). 12 pts (34%) met the criteria of oligoprogression with a median of 2 progressive lesions/pt (range 1 -5). 8 pts presented with bone progression only, 3 with nodal progression, and 1 pt with combined bone/nodal progression. Post-docetaxel pts had pre-AA metastatic lesions located in bone (75%), lymph nodes (35%), lungs (5%) and liver (5%). Progression during AA therapy occurred in bone (80%), lymph nodes (75%), lungs (20%) and liver (5%). Only 1 pt met oligoprogression criteria with a single progressive bone metastasis. Conclusion(s): A sizeable number of men with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC progressing during AA therapy might be considered for SABR. By contrast, progression of post-docetaxel mCRPC treated with AA is typically widespread. Further efforts are needed to identify criteria for oligoprogressive pts most suitable for SABR with sustained benefit versus men that may progress rapidly with widespread metastases following radiotherapy.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,,,

Importantly, biomarkers to determine patients who benefit most from complete ablation are unknown. We hypothesize that stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR) will improve oncologic outcomes in men with OMPC. Materials/Methods: In this phase II randomized trial, men with recurrent hormone-sensitive OMPC (1-3 radiation fields) were stratified by primary management (radiotherapy vs surgery), PSA doubling time, and prior androgen deprivation therapy and randomized 2:1 to SABR or observation (OBS). The primary endpoint was progression at 6 months by PSA (>= 25% increase and >= nadir + 2 ng/mL), conventional imaging (RECIST 1.1 criteria or new lesion on bone scan), or symptomatic decline. Tissue, liquid and imaging correlative studies were obtained and analyzed as biomarkers. Result(s): From 5/2016-3/2018, 54 patients were randomized. Progression at 6 months was observed in 19% of patients in the SABR arm and 61% of patients in the OBS arm (ITT, p=0.005). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached for men treated with SABR and 5.8 months for men who underwent OBS (HR 0.30, p = 0.0023). Of 35 patients in the SABR arm who received PSMA-based PET/CT imaging at baseline and 6 months, those with total consolidation of radiotracer-avid disease were less likely to develop new lesions at 6 months (16% vs 63%, p = 0.006) and had significantly longer median PFS (unreached vs 11.8 months, p = 0.003) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (29 vs 6.0 months, p = 0.0008). No grade III or higher toxicity was observed. Deep sequencing of T-cell receptor DNA identified significantly more clonotypic expansions (p = 0.03) between baseline and day 90 with SABR than with observation, greater peripheral baseline clonality was correlated with progression at 180 days in the SABR arm only, and clusters of similar expanded T-cell receptors were identified in 3 patients after SABR. Analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is in progress. Conclusion(s): SABR for OMPC affords significant benefits in freedom from progression at 6 months and PFS. In fact, the PFS for patients treated with SABR still has not been reached and is well over one year. Total consolidation of disease identified by PSMA-PET with SABR provides a substantial advantage in DMFS (4.8 times greater) when compared to subtotal consolidation. SABR also induces a systemic adaptive immune response and baseline clonality was associated with predictive response to SABR. These results underline the importance of prospective randomized investigation of the oligometastatic state with concurrent collection of imaging and biological correlates. Author Disclosure: R.

This study aimed to reduce the heterogeneity by pooling individual patient data from different institutions treating oligometastatic PCa recurrence with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). We focussed on patients who were treatment naive, with the aim of determining if SBRT could delay disease progression. We included patients with three or fewer metastases. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate distant progression-free survival (DPFS) and local progression-free survival (LPFS). Toxicity was scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. In total, 163 metastases were treated in 119 patients. The median DPFS was 21 mo (95% confidence interval, 15-26 mo). A lower radiotherapy dose predicted a higher local recurrence rate with a 3-yr LPFS of 79% for patients treated with a biologically effective dose ≤100Gy versus 99% for patients treated with >100Gy (p=0.01). Seventeen patients (14%) developed toxicity classified as grade 1, and three patients (3%) developed grade 2 toxicity. No grade ≥3 toxicity occurred. These results should serve as a benchmark for future prospective trials. PATIENT SUMMARY: This multi-institutional study pools all of the available data on the use of stereotactic body radiotherapy for limited prostate cancer metastases. We concluded that this approach is safe and associated with a prolonged treatment progression-free survival.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,10.1016/j.eururo.2015.07.004,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were prospectively isolated from 37 patients with OPCa (≤3 metastases) who were treated with mdSBRT. Immunophenotyping identified circulating CD8(+) T-cell subpopulations, including tumor-reactive (T(TR)), effector memory, central memory (T(CM)), effector, and naïve T cells from samples collected before and after mdSBRT. Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess whether changes in these T-cell subpopulations were potential risk factors for death and/or progression. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival. Cumulative incidence for progression and new distant metastasis weas estimated, considering death as a competing risk. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 39 months (interquartile range, 34-43). Overall survival at 3 years was 78.2%. Cumulative incidence for local progression and new distant metastasis at 3 years was 16.5% and 67.6%, respectively. Between baseline and day 14 after mdSBRT, an increase in the T(CM) cell subpopulation was associated with the risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.22 [95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.47]; P = .033), and an increase in the T(TR) cell subpopulation was protective against the risk of local progression (hazard ratio, 0.80 [95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.98]; P = .032). CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the T(TR) cell subpopulation was protective against the risk of disease progression, and an increase in the T(CM) cell subpopulation was associated with the risk of death in patients with OPCa treated with mdSBRT.

We report the outcome of salvage radiotherapy, delivered with TomoTherapy(TT), in prostate cancer (PCa) patients (pts) previously submitted to radical prostatectomy and presenting persistent/ relapsing PSA and positive(+) lymph-nodes(LN) at 11 C-choline PET/CT(PET), treated with prophylactic TT on LN areas (pelvic/lombo-aortic, LA) and simultaneous integrated boost(SIB) on PET+ LN. Material and Methods From March 2007-May 2013, 36 PCa pts treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) +/- pelvic/LA LN dissection(LND), and presenting +LN at PET, were treated with TT. Analysis was restricted to oligometastatic treatment-naive PCa pts satisfying published selection criteria for SBRT (Ost et al, Eur Urol 2016), including also castration resistant and >3 +LN pts (worse prognosis). Pts characteristics were: median age 67(53-78) yrs; median PSA post-surgery/at relapse: 2.74(0.66-23.52) ng/ml; median Gleason score 8(6-10). Five pts underwent RP; 33 RP+LND. Twelve pts were pT2, 22 pT3, 1 pT4, 11 pN1, 1 M1a, 11 R1. Twenty one pts had androgen deprivation(AD) prescription after surgery, 5 were hormonal resistant; 1 patient was treated with chemotherapy(Docetaxel and Estramustine). The interval between surgery and PET was 19.3(3.1-170.2) mts, the median number of PET +LN was 3(1-20). In 23 pts AD was prescribed for a median of 19(0- 57) mts. Patients were treated with daily image-guided TT on pelvic/LA LN (51.8 Gy/28 fr), with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) on prostatic bed (71.4 Gy), and on PET+ LN (65.5 Gy). Results With a median follow up of 38.1(14.4-82) mts, acute toxicity was low (1 G3 GU acute toxicity;2 G2 bowel, 2 G2 rectal and 2 G2 GU acute toxicities). Late toxicities were: rectal 3 G2 13.9% (1 pt G3), lymphedema 3 G2 13.9% (1 pt needing surgery), and GU 3 G2: 33.4% (1 pt with salvage cystectomy). At the last control, late toxicities were mild, showing that most events were transitory with no rectal G2, 1 rectal G3; 2 GU G2, 3 GU G3 and 2 Lymphedema G2. A summary of outcome is shown in Table I and Figure I: Median biochemical relapse free survival (BRFS) was 51.2 months; 3 and 5-year biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS) was 65.5% and 43% respectively; distant progression free survival (DPFS) was 88% and 70% and Cancer Specific Survival was 92 and 83%. Conclusion Our excellent outcome results suggest that PET-guided prophylactic treatment of LN chains together with SIB to PET+ LN may translate in a substantial increase of bRFS and DPFS compared to reported results after SBRT. A phase III trial comparing these approaches would be suitable. Because of high GU toxicity caused by hypofractionation on post-operative settings the protocol for prostate bed irradiation was modified since 2014 to deliver 70-74 Gy with conventional fractionation.

In this multicenter randomized phase II trial, we therefore propose to assess the comparative efficacy of SBRT with or without Durvalumab (MEDI4736) in oligometastatic recurrent hormone sensitive prostate cancer patients. Method(s): Patients with PCa were eligible if they had a biochemical recurrence following treatment with curative intent, with a maximum of 5 bone or lymph node metastases, seen only on FCH-PET CT or Ga-PSMA PET CT, not seen on conventional imaging assessments (bone scan or thorax, abdomen and pelvis CT scan).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of the first 20 consecutive men with oligometastatic PCa, treated with SABR in a single institution, who had biochemical recurrence after previous curative treatment (surgery/radiotherapy), had no evidence of local recurrence, were not on palliative androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and had PSMA-PET/CT-confirmed oligometastatic disease (≤3 lesions). These men were treated with SABR to a dose of 30 Gy in three fractions for bone metastases, and 35-40 Gy in five fractions for nodal metastases. The outcomes of interest were: PSA response; local progression-free survival (LPFS); distant progression-free survival (DPFS); and ADT-free survival (ADTFS). A literature review was performed to identify published studies reporting on outcomes of PSMA-PET/CT-guided SABR. RESULTS: In our institutional cohort, 12 men (60%) had a decline in PSA post-SABR. One man had local progression 9.6 months post-SABR, with 12-month LPFS of 93%. Ten men had distant progression outside of their SABR treatment field, confirmed on PSMA-PET/CT, with 12-month DPFS of 62%, of whom four were treated with palliative ADT, two received prostate bed radiotherapy for prostate bed progression (confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging), and four received a further course of SABR (of whom one had further progression and was treated with palliative ADT). At last follow-up, six men (one with local progression and five with distant progression) had received palliative ADT. The 12-month ADTFS was 70%. Men with longer intervals between local curative treatment and SABR had better DPFS (P = 0.03) and ADTFS (P = 0.005). Four additional studies reporting on PSMA-PET/CT-guided SABR for oligometastatic PCa were identified and included in the review, giving a total of 346 patients. PSA decline was reported in 60-70% of men post-SABR. The 2-year LPFS, DPFS and ADTFS rates were 76-100%, 27-52%, and 58-62%, respectively.

Aim of the study was to demonstrate the feasibility of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy with the CyberKnife System and to determine local tumor control and failure patterns. Method(s): After diagnosis of nodal relapse, PET/CT guided stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) was done using the CyberKnife System and x-sight spine tracking. Treatments were performed between May 2015 and October 2016 and applied prescription doses were 3 x 10 Gy, 1 x 19 Gy, 6 x 7 Gy, or 3 x 8 Gy (65% isodose level). PTV included PET-positive lesions only. Initially, all patients had high-grade prostate cancer (initial mean PSA value 34.3 ng/ml) and were treated by radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymphonodectomy. In case of increased PSA after robotic radiosurgery, PSMA-PET/CT scan was carried out to evaluated the local control rate. Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) was not mandatory. Result(s): Nine pelvic and paraaortic lesions in seven patients were treated. Mean age was 71 years. Mean follow up time was six months (1-12 months). Three patients received ADT before, during and after SBRT, one patient received ADT until PSA-value dropped down after SBRT. No local relapse was seen so far. Four patients showed signs of progression (outfield lymphatic progression or PSA-elevation). One of them received ADT at time of lymphatic progress. Mean time to metastatic progression was 6.5 months. Mean PSA-value before SBRT was 3.66 ng/dl and dropped to 1.86 ng/dl at last follow-up. Treatment related toxicity was mild. Conclusion(s): PSMA-PET/CT guided SBRT for patients with nodal relapse of prostate cancer after primary surgical treatment showed excellent local control.

random-journal.pdf,ProM155,"H., Zakaria",2016,English,5 study;pro.m:#1;pro.p:#1,Psoas size predicts survival in patients with lung cancer metastasis to the spine,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Patient frailty has been defined as a decreased reserve to resistance to stressors, with decline across multiple physiologic systems, and is a common endpoint in human senescence. For a surgeon, the clinical appreciation of a frail patient is important, as a recent body of literature has shown that frailty can predict morbidity and mortality after general, vascular, transplant and neurological surgery. Unfortunately, measuring human frailty is subjective, burdensome, and impractical in most clinical settings, and so surrogate markers of frailty, namely sarcopenia, has been successfully used to predict postoperative morbidity and mortality following major neurosurgical, general, vascular and transplant surgery. Morphometrics is the measurement of patient attributes that are indicative of sarcopenia, and thus frailty by proxy. In terms of oncologic surgery, the observation has consistently been that patients who are sarcopenic, not only have increased postoperative morbidity and mortality, but also have a shorter progression free survival. The relationship with increased muscle mass and disease free survival has even been observed in oncologic patients who have not undergone any cancer surgery. This is an important observation, as current methodologies for predicting oncologic outcomes rely solely on histologic grade of the cancer and its TNM tumor staging. Identifying more accurate and specific markers of survival would enable oncologists to better identify which patients are appropriate candidates a specific treatment, whether it is chemotherapy, radiation, surgery or palliation. PURPOSE: In this study, we applied morphometric analysis of sarcopenia to predict oncologic outcomes in patients who have lung cancer metastases to the spine. In our previous work, we have applied this methodology to lumbar spine surgery using psoas area as a marker for sarcopenia. Our hypothesis was that patients with smaller psoas area would have shorter survival after being diagnosed with metastasis to the spine in patients with primary lung cancer. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Utilizing a retrospective registry of spinal metastases patients from 2002-2012 who have undergone stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the spinal column, we identified a population of patients all who had primary lung cancer diagnoses. This included all histological subtypes of lung cancer. OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome of interest was overall survival, which was measured from the date of the patient's scan (MRI or CT) to date of death. For patients who were still alive at the time of analysis, survival was calculated to the most recent documented follow-up. The median survival (in days) along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval were computed for all patients, as well as subsets of interest. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were done to estimate the hazard ratios and test for differences in the variables of interest. METHOD(S): Using previously proven methodology, circumferential morphometric measurements were taken of the psoas muscle at the L4 vertebral body. Measurements were taken from spinal CT or MRI at the time of SBRT for metastases. Psoas muscle sizes were ultimately divided into tertiles according to total psoas area. RESULT(S): A total of 178 patients with lung cancer spinal metastases were identified. Ninety-eight patients (55%) were males, and 95 (53%) presented with multiple level metastasis. The median survival for all patients was 156 days (95% CI=116-197 days). The associations of overall survival with gender and the number of levels were not significant. However, the association of overall survival with type of scan was significant (p<.001), with patients receiving an MRI having shorter survival compared to patients receiving CT. Psoas muscle area measurements were divided into tertiles, with adjustments accounted for gender differences in muscle size. When considering the total psoas tertiles based on gender only, the difference between the lowest and highest tertiles was significant (p=.033) with patients in the lowest tertile having shorter survival (115 days, 95% CI=85-67) compared to patients in the highest tertile (253.5 days, 95%CI=158-337). In addition, patients in the lowest tertile had significantly (p=.022) shorter survival as compared to the middle and highest tertile combined (188.5 days, 95% CI=127-254). The differences for the total psoas tertiles based on gender and type of scan and ratio of total psoas to vertebral body area tertiles were not significant. CONCLUSION(S): Our results illustrate that morphometric analysis of psoas size may be predictive of survival in patients with lung cancer metastasis to the spine. The other notable statistical finding in this study is that the type of scan available for morphometric analysis showed that patients who had an MRI were at risk with a significantly shorter survival. This may be due to treatment regimens after imaging, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy. We did find that patients who had an MRI compared to CT did have lower mean psoas size. Given the retrospective nature of this study and non-standardized imaging protocols, it will be difficult to account for potential bias that reflects this finding. However, our study does show the potential of morphometric measurements as a surrogate for survival in this specific population. Future multicenter prospective study will be required to fully validate this methodology. In addition, our methods can also be applied toward other cancer subgroups (breast, prostate, GI, etc.) for future study as well.",exclusion,Other tumor treated (spinal),,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spinee.2016.07.376,ProP209,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We enrolled patients who had a controlled primary malignancy with 1 to 5 metastatic lesions, with good performance status and life expectancy >6 months. We randomized in a 1:2 ratio between standard of care (SOC) treatment (SOC arm) and SOC plus SABR to all metastatic lesions (SABR arm). QoL was measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General. QoL changes over time and between groups were assessed with linear mixed modeling. RESULTS: Ninety-nine patients were randomized. Median age was 68 years (range, 43-89), and 60% were male. The most common primary tumor types were breast (n = 18), lung (n = 18), colorectal (n = 18), and prostate (n = 16). Most patients (n = 92) had 1 to 3 metastases. Median follow-up was 26 months. Because of the previously reported inferior survival of the SOC arm, the time for attrition in QoL respondents to <10% of subjects was shorter in the SOC versus SABR arm (30 vs 42 months). In the whole cohort, QoL declined over time after randomization: There were significant declines in total Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General score over time compared with baseline (P < .001) owing to declines in physical and functional subscales (both P < .001), with no declines in social and emotional subscales. However, the magnitudes of decline were small, and clinically meaningful changes were not seen at most time points. Comparison between arms showed no differences in QoL between the SABR and SOC arms in total score (P = .42) or in the physical (P = .98), functional (P = .59), emotional (P = .82), or social (P = .17) subscales.

Quality of life (QoL) is of substantial importance in the metastatic setting, since treatments have historically been considered palliative-intent. However, randomized data assessing the longitudinal QoL impact of SABR in the oligometastatic setting are lacking. Herein we report longitudinal QoL outcomes from the SABR-COMET randomized trial. Materials/Methods: We enrolled patients who had a controlled primary malignancy with 1-5 metastatic lesions, all of which were amenable to SABR, with good performance status and life expectancy >6 months. We stratified by the number of metastases (1-3 vs. 4-5) then randomized in a 1:2 ratio between standard of care (SOC) treatment [SOC Arm] vs. SOC plus SABR to all metastatic lesions [SABR Arm]. Due to the wide variety of tumor sites and treatment targets included, QoL was measured using a general tool, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G), which includes 4 subscales: Physical Well Being, Social/Family Well Being, Emotional Well Being, and Functional Well Being. A 5-point decline in the total FACT-G scale, or a two-point decline on a subscale, is generally considered a clinically meaningful change (CMC). QoL changes over time and between groups was assessed with linear mixed modeling. Result(s): Ninety-nine patients were randomized (33 in Arm 1, 66 in Arm 2). Median age was 68 (range: 43-89) and 60% were male. The most common primary tumor types were breast (n=18), lung (n=18), colorectal (n=18) and prostate (n=16). Most patients (n=92) had 1-3 metastases. Median follow-up was 26 months. Because of the inferior survival of the SOC arm, as previously reported, the time for attrition in QOL respondents to <10% of subjects was shorter in the SOC vs SABR arm (30 vs. 42 months). In the whole cohort, QoL declined over time after randomization: there were significant declines in total FACT-G score over time compared to baseline (p<0.001), due to declines in physical and functional subscales (both p<0.001), with no declines in social and emotional subscales. However, the magnitude of declines were small, and CMCs were not seen at most time points. Comparison between arms showed no differences in QoL between the SABR and SOC arms in total score (p=0.42), or in the physical (p=0.98), functional (p=0.59), emotional (p=0.82) or social (p=0.17) subscales. Conclusion(s): For patients with oligometastases, average QoL declines slowly over time regardless of treatment approach, although the changes are small in magnitude. The use of SABR, compared to SOC, was not associated with a QoL detriment. This suggests that QoL changes are due to underlying disease processes over time.

Antigen-specific immune responses have also been shown for prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy. We examined whether RITI can be induced in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following proton radiotherapy. METHODS: Pre- and post-radiotherapy plasma samples from 26 patients with nonmetastatic NSCLC who received radiotherapy between 2010 and 2012 were evaluated by western blotting for IgG and IgM bands to assess RITI response to tumor antigens from lung cancer cell lines. Statistical analysis was used to evaluate any correlation among IgG or IgM and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients received proton therapy at 2 GyRBE/fraction (n = 17) or 6-12 Gy/fraction (n = 4); five received photon therapy at 2-2.5 GyRBE/fraction. Compared with the pretreatment baseline, new IgG or IgM binding was detected in 27% and 50% of patients, respectively. New IgG bands were detected in the 25-37 kD, 50-75 kD, and 75-100 kD ranges. New IgM bands were detected in the 20-25 kD, 25-37 kD, 37-50 kD, 50-75 kD, and 75-100 kD ranges. There was no difference in IgG and/or IgM RITI response in patients treated with photons versus protons, or in patients who received SBRT compared to standard fractionation (P > 0.05). There was no difference in overall survival, metastasis-free survival, or local control based on IgG and/or IgM RITI response (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: RITI can be induced in patients with NSCLC through upregulated IgG and/or IgM. RITI response was not associated with proton versus photon therapy or with clinical outcomes in this small cohort and should be examined in a larger cohort in future studies.",exclusion,Other tumor treated (lung),,10.1111/1759-7714.13122,ProP213,,

New imaging-modalities have increased the diagnosed patients with limited number of metastasis after primary curative therapy, introducing so-called oligometastatic state. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is emerging as a low-toxicity treatment to erase PCa localizations and postpone androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). A deeper understanding of the predictive role of biomarkers is desirable for a targeted treatment selection and surveillance programs. The aims of the RADIOSA trial are: 1. Compare SBRT +/- ADT for oligorecurrent-castration-sensitive PCa (OCS-PCa) in terms of efficacy, toxicity and Quality of Life (QoL). 2. Develop biology/imaging based prognostic tool that allows identifying OCS-PCa subclasses. Method(s): This is a randomized phase II clinical trial, recruiting 160 OCS-PCa in 3 years, with progression-free survival (PFS) as primary endpoint. Three tasks will be developed: 1. Randomized clinical study (3 years for accrual and 2 years for follow-up and data analysis); 2. Imaging study, including imaging registration and METastasis Reporting and Data System (MET-RADS) criteria; 3. Pre-clinical study, development of a biobank of blood samples for the analysis of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and preparatory for a subsequent miRNA profiling. We aim to determine which arm is justified for testing in a subsequent Phase III trial. A decision-tree algorithm, based on prognosis, biological phenotype and imaging profile, will be developed. Discussion(s): Recruiting will start in July 2019. SBRT will allow obtaining excellent PFS, local control, QoL and low toxicity. In SBRT arm, ADT deferral will allow for a drug-holiday, delaying the detrimental impact on QoL. A sufficient number of blood samples will be collected to perform biological patient profiling. A stratification tool will be established with an analysis of morphological and functional imaging, based on the use of MET-RADS criteria. So, in conclusion, RADIOSA aims to define the optimal management of bone/nodal PCa relapses in a SBRT regimen. This study will increase our knowledge on low-burden metastatic PCa in the era of high precision and high technology personalized medicine, offering highly effective therapy in terms of clinical outcome and cost-effectiveness.

RECENT FINDINGS: Three different clinical scenarios of oligometastatic PCa exist in which MDT can be applied: de novo oligometastatic PCa, oligorecurrent PCa, and oligoprogressive PCa. A cut off of three to five metastatic lesions is most often used in these settings. Data from retrospective studies, treating over 1000 patients in total, have been reported. The median progression-free survival ranges between 1 and 3 years, but is influenced by a heterogeneous use of androgen deprivation therapy. For lymph node metastases, a propensity scored matched analysis suggests that cancer specific and overall survival is improved with MDT over standard of care. MDT treatment regimens vary with different radiotherapy techniques, doses, and volumes. Adverse events are limited to grade 1-2 and only rarely grade 3 events are reported. SUMMARY: Based on data from retrospective studies, progression-free survival following MDT for oligometastatic PCa is promising with few adverse events. Comparative prospective studies are under way and will shed light on the future of MDT.",exclusion,review,Llegir com a font de referències.

Besides androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as standard of care, both elective nodal radiotherapy (ENRT) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) as well as salvage lymph node dissection (sLND) are common treatment options. The aim of our study was to assess decision making and practice patterns for salvage radiotherapy (RT) in this setting. METHODS: Treatment recommendations from 14 Swiss radiation oncology centers were collected and converted into decision trees. An iterative process using the objective consensus methodology was applied to assess differences and consensus. RESULTS: PSMA PET/CT was recommended by 93% of the centers as restaging modality. For unfit patients defined by age, comorbidities or low performance status, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone was recommended by more than 70%. For fit patients with unfavorable tumor characteristics such as short prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time or initial high-risk disease, the majority of the centers (57-71%) recommended ENRT + ADT for 1-4 lesions. For fit patients with favorable tumor characteristics, there were low levels of consensus and a wide variety of recommendations. For 1-4 nodal lesions, focal SBRT was offered by 64% of the centers, most commonly as a 5-fraction course. CONCLUSIONS: As an alternative to ADT, ENRT or SBRT for pelvic nodal oligorecurrences of PC are commonly offered to selected patients, with large treatment variations between centers.

This progression might not indicate a real systemic drug resistance, but a selective monoclonal resistance. With the aim to delay the start of new line treatments we treated oligo-progressive sites with radiotherapy. METHODS: From June 2011 to Febrary 2019, 29 consecutive metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients were submitted to radiotherapy for oligo-progression (1-3 sites) during ARTT for a total of 37 lesions treated. Thirty-one (83.8%) lesions were treated with conformal radiotherapy and 6 (16.2%) with stereotactic radiotherapy. After radiotherapy all patients continued ARTT. RESULTS: Median OS (calculated from ARTT start) was 46,6 months (range 4.4-97.5 months), 2 and 3-year OS were 82.8 and 70.7%, respectively. Median PFS was 18,4 months (range 4.4-45.3 months), 2 and 3-year PFS were 38.3 and 8.5%, respectively. Median overall duration of ARTT treatment was 14.8 months (range 4.4-45.3 months) and median duration of ARTT after radiotherapy was 4.6 months (range 1-33.8 months). Patients submitted to radiotherapy > 6 months from the start of ARTT presented a better PFS (p < 0.001) and a trend toward a better OS (p = 0.101). None patient presented RT and drug related toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy of oligoprogressive sites may prolong the duration of disease control under ARTT in mCRPC patients with a possible delay in the start of new line treatment. Patients progressing within 6 months from the start of ARTT did not benefit from this approach. More studies are necessary to confirm our results and to evaluate other prognostic factor in order to select patients with high benefit from this approach.",inclusion,,"Disseny prospectiu i no randomitzat.

Bone metastases are the most common site of oligometastatic disease thus targeting the bone niche may help prevent spread of oligometastatic and micrometastatic disease. Radium 223 dichloride acts as a calcium mimetic targeting active areas of bone turnover observed in osteoblastic lesions. It is FDA approved for treatment of bone metastases in the castrate resistant prostate cancer setting but its role in castrate sensitive oligometastatic prostate cancer remains unknown. Based on the bone targeting mechanism of action of radium 223 we hypothesized that the combination of SBRT and Radium 223 would improve the therapeutic effect on both oligometastatic and micrometastatic bone disease in patients with oligometastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer. 9 months of standard androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with LHRH agonist was chosen as systemic therapy throughout treatment with SBRT and Radium223 dichloride as was used in our prior oligometastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer trial and based on lack of definitive evidence indicating benefit of intensification of hormonal therapy or chemotherapy in that setting. Method(s): Design: phase II single arm study. Treatment: 9 months of ADT, SBRT to all oligometastatic sites (<=4), and Radium 223 (1 course = 6 cycles). Eligibility Criteria: oligometastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer including bone. 10Endpoint: Time to treatment failure. Assessment will involve both PSA and radiographic progression. 2nd Endpoint: Safety of adding Radium 223 to SBRT and ADT for oligometastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer. Follow-up: 5 years. Statistics: We are hypothesizing median time to treatment failure (TTF) of 25 months in the current study exceeding other prior reports and a 9 month improvement over historical data from our prior City of Hope (COH) oligometastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer trial. Correlatives: To identify changes in immune cell activity during treatment for oligometastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer.

The primary endpoint is to test the safety of SBRT for the treatment of 2 to 4 multiple lesions in several anatomic sites in a multi-institutional setting. Because of the technical challenges inherent to treating multiple lesions as their spatial separation decreases, we present the technical requirements for NRG-BR001 and the rationale for their selection. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with controlled primary tumors of breast, non-small cell lung, or prostate are eligible if they have 2 to 4 metastases distributed among 7 extracranial anatomic locations throughout the body. Prescription and organ-at-risk doses were determined by expert consensus. Credentialing requirements include (1) irradiation of the Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core phantom with SBRT, (2) submitting image guided radiation therapy case studies, and (3) planning the benchmark. Guidelines for navigating challenging planning cases including assessing composite dose are discussed. RESULTS: Dosimetric planning to multiple lesions receiving differing doses (45-50 Gy) and fractionation (3-5) while irradiating the same organs at risk is discussed, particularly for metastases in close proximity (≤5 cm). The benchmark case was selected to demonstrate the planning tradeoffs required to satisfy protocol requirements for 2 nearby lesions. Examples of passing benchmark plans exhibited a large variability in plan conformity. DISCUSSION: NRG-BR001 was developed using expert consensus on multiple issues from the dose fractionation regimen to the minimum image guided radiation therapy guidelines. Credentialing was tied to the task rather than the anatomic site to reduce its burden. Every effort was made to include a variety of delivery methods to reflect current SBRT technology. Although some simplifications were adopted, the successful completion of this trial will inform future designs of both national and institutional trials and would allow immediate clinical adoption of SBRT trials for oligometastases.",exclusion,Study protocol,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prro.2016.05.004,,,

However, the clinical factors predictive of a response to pembrolizumab in men with prostate cancer are unknown. Patients and Methods: A total of 54 consecutive men with progressive, recurrent, or advanced prostate cancer were treated with 1 to 12 cycles of pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks with or without stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Result(s): For the 31 men evaluable for response, the median age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and Gleason score were 75 years, 30 ng/mL, and 8 (4 + 4), respectively, which were similar to those for the 23 nonevaluable patients. The treatments received before pembrolizumab were enzalutamide in 26, abiraterone in 18, and sipuleucel-T in 23. All but 4 men had had castrate-resistant disease. Of the 54 men, 31 had completed >= 4 cycles of pembrolizumab and were evaluable for the response. Ten men had undergone SBRT to an isolated metastasis shortly before or during pembrolizumab treatment, with the goal of inducing an abscopal effect. The clinical characteristics of the 17 men with a response or stable disease were compared with those of the 14 men with progressive disease. Grade >= 2 toxicity occurred in 16 men (30%). PSA stabilization or a response occurred in slightly more than one half (55%) of the men treated with >= 4 cycles of pembrolizumab. Five patients had a notable PSA decline of > 50%, which were sustained as long as they had continued receiving pembrolizumab. A PSA response or stabilization was more common for men who had begun taking pembrolizumab with a lower PSA level, fewer bone metastases, and fewer mutations and without previous chemotherapy. A statistically nonsignificant trend toward stabilization or a response was observed in men who had undergone concomitant SBRT. Conclusion(s): Pembrolizumab showed modest anticancer activity against metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. A PSA response or stabilization occurred more frequently in men with less-advanced disease., The clinical profile of 54 patients treated with pembrolizumab was assessed to elucidate the factors associated with a tumor response and toxicity. We observed prostate-specific antigen responses significantly more frequently in men with a lower baseline prostate-specific antigen level, fewer metastases, fewer mutations, and without previous chemotherapy.

Material(s) and Method(s): In a dose escalation (Phase I) study, previously irradiated patients were enrolled in two different arms depending on treatment site and previous dose: 1) retreatment with previous dose > 60 Gy or retreatment of pancreatic and pelvic tumors, 2) retreatment with previous dose < 60 Gy. SBRT was delivered in 5 fractions with static 3D technique (4 non-coplanar beams) or dynamic arc (VMAT). The dose was prescribed at the isocenter. The Planning Target Volume (PTV) was defined as the GTV + 5-15 mm margin. According to the study arm, the first cohort of 6 patients received a dose of 20 or 25 Gy, and subsequent cohorts of patients received doses up to 40 Gy. The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any acute and late toxicity Grade >= 3. The MTD was defined a s the dose level with 2/6 or 4/12 DLT. Result(s): From September 2004 to December 2014, 51 patients (M/F: 27/24; median age 65, range 44-87), previously irradiated with doses of 30 to 87 Gy (median dose 50 Gy) were enrolled, after 4-228 months from the first treatment (median 11 months). Sixty-six lesions were treated (23 primary lesions or relapses, 43 lymphadenopathies) mainly from gynecological tumors (30%), followed by gastrointestinal tumors (26%) and prostatic tumors (17%). Nineteen of the 66 lesions were in the neck or chest, 22 in the abdomen and 25 in the pelvis. With a median follow-up of 19 months (3-104), an overall response rate of 81% (Complete Response: 55%, Partial Response: 26%), with only 3% of disease progression was recorded.

Focal robotic stereotactic body radiotherapy (rSBRT) to the recurrent intraprostatic tumor is emerging as a valuable option in this setting. In this retrospective study, we evaluated efficacy and toxicity of robotic SBRT for exclusive local failure after primary EBRT. Patients and Methods: Data from 28 patients treated at our Institution from September 2012 to December 2015 with rSBRT for prostate cancer recurrence after definitive EBRT were retrospectively reviewed. Local intraprostatic recurrence was assessed by 18 F-choline positron-emission tomography- computed tomography (PET); a dose of 30 Gy was delivered in 5 fractions. PSA was assessed at 2 months, 6 months, and every 4 months following rSBRT. Toxicity was assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events toxicity scale (CTCAE v.4.03). Result(s): Patients were stratified into low (n=5, 17.9%), intermediate (n=9, 32.1%) and high-risk group (n=14, 50.0%) at diagnosis. Median patient age at rSBRT was 78.5 (62-86) years. All patients received prior EBRT for a median total dose of 76 Gy (62-80 Gy) in 2 (1.8- 3.1) Gy/fraction. Median time from primary treatment to relapse was 74.1 (19.3-149.2) months. Five patients were receiving androgen-deprivation therapy following prior biochemical failure; median pre-treatment PSA value was 2.7 (2.1-14.4) ng/ml. Twenty-five patients showed biochemical response to treatment at 2 and 6 months, median PSA decline was 54.0% (2.2-95.0%) and 76.0% (35.9-95.0%) respectively; three patients experienced early PSA progression at 2 and 6 months, median PSA elevation was 112.3% (20.0-204.5%) and 267.0% (41.9-309.1%), respectively. At the time of our analysis, after a median follow-up of 20.9 (6.3-49.2) months, 10 patients showed no evidence of disease, two continued androgen deprivation with stable PSA levels, while 10 patients experienced biochemical relapse; among them, metastatic recurrence occurred in four cases. Biochemical progressionfree survival (bPFS) was 96.4% and 75.0% at 12 and 18 months, respectively. Rectal and bladder acute toxicity grade 1-2 was found in four and one case, respectively; grade 1-2 late rectal and bladder toxicity occurred in one and seven cases, respectively. One patient experienced both grade 3 acute and chronic bladder toxicity, consisting of acute urinary retention and hematuria respectively. At univariate and multivariate analysis of pre-treatment variables, impaired bPFS was correlated only with high-risk category at diagnosis (hazard ratio=13.06, p=0.021). No predictive factor for improved bPFS was found at subset analysis in responding patients, although a trend was observed for PSA decline at 6 months >76.0% (p=0.06).

METHODS: 32 patients received re-EBRT between February 2008 and October 2013. All patients had clinical/radiological local relapse in the prostate or prostatic bed and no distant metastasis. re-EBRT was delivered with selective RT technologies [stereotactic RT including CyberKnife(TM) (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA); image-guidance and intensity-modulated RT etc.]. Toxicity was evaluated using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria. Biochemical control was assessed according to the Phoenix definition (NADIR + 2 ng ml(-1)). RESULTS: Acute urinary toxicity: G0, 24 patients; G1, 6 patients; G2, 2 patients. Acute rectal toxicity: G0, 28 patients; G1, 2 patients; and G2, 1 patient. Late urinary toxicity (evaluated in 30 cases): G0, 23 patients; G1, 6 patients; G2, 1 patient. Late renal toxicity: G0, 25 patients; G1, 5 patients. A mean follow-up of 21.3 months after re-EBRT showed that 13 patients were free of cancer, 3 were alive with biochemical relapse and 12 patients were alive with clinically evident disease. Four patients had died: two of disease progression and two of other causes. CONCLUSION: re-EBRT using modern technology is a feasible approach for local prostate cancer recurrence offering 2-year tumour control in about half of the patients. Toxicity of re-EBRT is low. Future studies are needed to identify the patients who would benefit most from this treatment. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Our series, based on experience in one hospital alone, shows that re-EBRT for local relapse of prostate cancer is feasible and offers a 2-year cure in about half of the patients.",exclusion,,,10.1259/bjr.20150197,,,

Thus, localizing the residual disease after surgery is crucial to precisely define the planned target volume (PTV) of salvage radiotherapy (SRT). Objective(s): to evaluate the impact of 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT on SRT planning in BCP patients. Material(s) and Method(s): Design: 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT is performed in our institution through a prospective, single-center, open-label study (prot. P-5315) in hormone-na?ve PCa. We performed a retrospective sub-analysis in BCP patients matching these inclusion criteria: 1) RP as primary therapy; 2) PSA-nadir >0.1 ng/mL at 8 weeks after RP; 3) No adjuvant/salvage therapy or hormonal-therapy performed after RP; 4) all patients considered eligible for SRT in prostate bed; 5) PET scan performed within 12 months from RP. Changes in clinical management and SRT planning were defined by a singlecentre multidisciplinary tumour board. Population characteristics: twenty-eight (n=28) patients matched all inclusion criteria and were analysed. ISUP grade <=3 (n=11/28), >=4 (n=17/28); stage >=pT3a (n=17/28); pN1 (n=7/28); R1 (n=16/28). Median/mean PSA-nadir=0.34/0.48 ng/mL (0.1-3.3); median/mean PSAdt=2.8/7.1 months (0.6-44.6); median/mean PSAvel=0.8/3.1 ng/mL/year (range 0.1-24.7). Result(s): Overall results: 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT detection rate was 57.1% (CI95% 37.4%-75.0%). Median/mean PSA at time of imaging=0.53/1.06 ng/mL (range 0.22-8.9). Prostate bed relapse only was detected in 3.6% of cases. Intra-pelvic relapse (pelvic lymph-nodes with/ without prostate bed) was detected in 21.4%,.The presence of at least one extra-pelvic lesion (extra-pelvic nodes and/or bone) was detected in 32.1%. of cases. Oligometastatic disease (1-3 PSMA positive lesions) was detected in 53.6% of cases. SRT planning: in 46.4% of patients (13/28), SRT in prostate bed was confirmed as intended before PET scan. In 53.6% of patients SRT planning was changed: 7/28 patients performed SRT in prostate bed and additional stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) on PET positive findings. In 2/28 cases PTV was modified including only PET positive pelvic nodes without standard radiotherapy in prostate bed. SRT was aborted in 5/28 patients and ADT was administrated instead. In 1/28 case SRT was aborted and pelvic lymph-node dissection was performed. Conclusion(s): In this patient-series, 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT proved its role in BCP setting detecting disease outside prostate bed in 53.5% of cases and SRT planning was modified due to the integration of 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT results into the decision-making process. These data may suggest the presence of extended disease not detected by conventional imaging prior to surgery and highlight the importance of PET imaging in BCP setting.",exclusion,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00259-019-04486-2,ProP228,,

METHOD(S): We retrospective identified 74 patients with rrPCa (2010-2016). Of those, 54 (73 %) vs. 20 (27 %) were previously treated with EBRT vs. BT. All patients with rrPCa were diagnosed with PSA raising and choline PET (showing non-metastatic disease), or multiparametric MRI followed by prostate biopsy in both groups. Overall, 29 (40%) vs. 45 (60%) patients were treated with S-RARP vs. S-RT. All S-RARP were non Nerve Sparing with extended bilateral pelvic limph node dissection, while S-RT patients underwent intensity modulated or stereotactic radiation therapy on the prostate with a 25 to 30 Gy dose divided in 5 to 6 fractions. Kaplan-Meier plots depicted progression free (PFS), cancer-specific (CSS) and overall (OS) rates over time in S-RARP vs. S-RT patients. The cut off for Biochemical Relapse (BCR) after S-RT was assessed as PSA nadir after RT + 2 ng/ml, according to the Philadelphia criteria, while for S-RARP was 0,1 ng/ml. RESULT(S): Compared to S-RARP, patients treated with S-RT were older (75.8 vs. 67 years; p=0.001). Overall, 16 (55%) vs. 23 (52%) and 13 (45%) vs. 22 (48%) patients treated with S-RARP vs. SRT had a primary diagnosis of ISUP GG1 and ISUP GG 2 PCa before primary RT (p=0.7). Median time from primary RT to salvage treatment was, respectively, 65.5 (IQR 26.55 - 90.15) vs 102.6 (IQR 78.4 - 130.6) months for S-RARP vs S-RT (P= 0.001). Median time follow-up after salvage treatment was 41.5 months. Overall, 11 (39.3%) vs. 22 (56.4%) patients had biochemical recurrence after S-RARP vs. S-RT (p=0.1). Moreover, CSM and OCM rates were, respectively, 0(0 %) vs. 6 (13 %) (p=0,04) and 0 (0 %) vs. 6 (13 %) (p= 0,04) in patients treated with S-RARP vs. S-RT. CONCLUSION(S): S-RARP and S-RT appears to achieve the same rates of cancer control in patient swith radio-recurrent prostate cancer after primary RT. Despite this, randomized control trials are needed to confirm these results.",exclusion,,,,ProP229,,

Our objective was to investigate the feasibility and efficiency of Robotic Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) in this clinical setting. METHODS/MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed patients who were treated at our institution with SBRT for local prostate cancer recurrence after External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) or brachytherapy. Multidisciplinary staff approved the treatment, and recurrence was biopsy-proven when feasible. A dose of 36 Gy was prescribed in six fractions. Treatment was delivered every other day. RESULTS: Between August 2011 and February 2014, 23 patients were treated with SBRT for intra-prostate cancer recurrence with a median follow up of 22 months (6 to 40). Twenty patients had biopsy-proven recurrence. For 19 patients, EBRT was the initial treatment and in four patients, brachytherapy was the initial treatment; the median relapse-time from initial treatment was 65 months (28 to 150). At relapse, 10 patients had an extra-capsular extension. Fourteen patients were treated with androgen deprivation that could be stopped after a median of 1 month after SBRT (range 0-24). A PSA decrease occurred in 82.6% of the patients after SBRT. The 2-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates were 54 and 100%, respectively. Disease progression was observed for nine patients (39.1%) (five local, three metastatic and one nodal progression) after a median of 20 months (7-40 months). The median nadir PSA was 0.35 ng/ml and was achieved after a median of 8 months (1 to 30) after treatment. We observed no grade 4 or 5 toxicity. Two patients presented with grade 3 toxicities (two Cystitis and one neuralgia). Other toxicities included urinary toxicities (five grade 2 and nine grade 1) and rectal toxicities (two grade 2 and two grade 1). CONCLUSION: SBRT for local prostate cancer recurrence seems feasible and well tolerated with a short follow up. Prospective evaluation is needed.",exclusion,,,10.1186/s13014-017-0833-9,,,

The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the acute and late toxicity rates, in salvage stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) as a treatment modality in nodes oligo-recurrence, from prostate cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): Between February 2013 and March 2015, 21 patients, for a total of 29 isolated lymph nodes from prostate cancer, were treated with SBRT, delivered with Truebeam Stx (Varian), at UPMC San Pietro FBF radiotherapy center of Rome. The median age at primitive diagnoses was 65 (range 50-74) years. For the primary treatment, radical prostatectomy and postoperative irradiation, exclusive radiotherapy or prostatectomy was performed in 12 (57%) patients, 7 patients (33%) and 2 patients (10%), respectively. Median previous RT dose was 72 Gy/35 fractions. Median PSA at the time of recurrence was 2.04ng/ml. All patients with arising PSA underwent a [11C] choline-positron emission tomography before SBRT, in order to exclude other sites of disease. The SBRT dose varied from 27 to 30 Gy, in 1-5 daily fractions, according to the previous RT treatment for the primitive lesion or a close organ at risk. A daily cone-beam CT and X-ray (BRAINLAB ExacTrac) scans were acquired before each treatment session, for every patient. Acute and late toxicity were analyzed, according to CTCAE toxicity scale (v. 4.0). Result(s): The median follow-up was 14.5 months. Most of patients received 30 Gy, in 3 fractions, on alternative days: all the patients completed the prescribed SBRT treatment. Fifteen patients (71%) received androgen deprivation therapy concomitant to SBRT. SBRT was well tolerated: only 1 patient experienced G2 acute rectal toxicity but we didn't observe any severe acute or late toxicity ( >=G3). Despite the short follow up, local control was 100%, distant control was 79% (6/21). All these recurrences were nodal and all out of SBRT field: in 2 of these 6 patients a new SBRT course was delivered (30 Gy in 3 fractions) while in the other hormonal therapy was proposed. At the moment of analysis, all patients were alive. Conclusion(s): Our experience shows that SBRT for isolated nodal relapse from prostate cancer is a safe treatment, offering a low toxicity profile and an excellent tumor local control.

A UK randomised phase III trial,"Introduction: Traditionally stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) have been used for prevention or palliation of symptoms. Mostly retrospective and single-arm studies have been published recording the safety of SABR/SRS, local control rates and survival with the addition of radical radiotherapy or SABR to all sites of disease in the first-line setting. Primary disease sites in these studies include NSCLC, melanoma, prostate and colorectal cancer. A recent North American study showed adding local consolidative therapy to standard systemic therapy improved progression-free survival. We are conducting the first randomised phase III trial to investigate the impact of conventional and SABR/ SRS in patients with oligometastatic NSCLC. Method(s): SARON is a randomised, multicentre, non-blinded phase III trial for patients with synchronous oligometastatic NSCLC (1-3 metastases). Patients suitable for radical treatment with performance status 0-2 will be randomised 1:1 to receive either standard chemotherapy (Control) or standard chemotherapy plus radiotherapy to all sites of disease (Investigational). Patients will have imaging scans at baseline to include a full body PET-CT and a brain CT/MRI with subsequent follow-up scans at months 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 post-chemotherapy. The primary endpoint is overall survival, secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, disease control, new distant metastasis-free survival and quality of life. A feasibility assessment will be made after 50 patients have been randomised. A safety sub-study will assess the use of conventional radiotherapy to the primary tumour plus SABR to thoracic metastases. The study is powered to detect an improvement in median survival from 9.9 to 14.3 months. Result(s): The trial was activated in August 2016 and is currently recruiting. In total, 340 patients will be recruited from 30 sites over 3 years.

The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of SBRT in postponing the start of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and assessthe pattern of recurrence post SBRT Material and Methods Forty-three patients treated with SBRT for oligometastatic recurrence of prostate cancer were included. Also, a control group of 20 patients not treated with SBRT was identified from other hospitals. Data was retrospectively collected and analyzed. Results A post-SBRT PSA response was seen in 29/43 patients (67.4%), with undetectable PSA in 6/43 patients (14.0%). The median ADT free survival (ADT-FS), defined as time between the start of SBRT and start of ADT, was 15.6 months (95% CI 11.7-19.5) for the whole group, and 25.7 months (95% CI 9.0-42.4) for patients with an initial PSA response. Seven patients were treated with a second course of SBRT because of oligometastatic disease recurrence; the ADTFS in this group was 32.1 months (95% CI 7.8-56.5). We compared the data of SBRT-treated patients with a group of 20 patients, managed in another hospital, by watchfull waiting followed by ADT. Compared to the control group, ADT-FS (from the date of first diagnosis of metastasis until start of SBRT) was significantly longer for SBRT treated patients with 17.3 months (95% CI 13.7-20.9) versus 4.19 months (95% CI 0.0-9.0), p<0.001. Once ADT had been started, the subsequent PFS during ADT treatment was comparable between both groups (median 31.5 months for SBRT-treated patients, versus 26.9 months for the control group, p=0.54). This results in a significanty longer period between the diagnosis of oligometastatic disease and development of castration resistant prostate cancer (see figure). Seventeen patients had a [18F]fluoromethylcholine PET/CT performed because of a rising PSA after the first course of SBRT. In 15 patients the rise in PSA could be attributed to lesions which were outside the high-dose SBRT volume, in 2 patients no cause was found, no local failures were identified on these scans. One patient had progressive disease in a previously non-suspicious 3mm lymph node adjacent to the irradiated node. Another patient had persistent disease in a partially irradiated lymph node adjacent to the index node treated at first SBRT. Seven patients (16.2%) had some form of toxicity recorded in their medical chart: 2 of the patients with bone metastases reported a pain flare (grade I), 5 patients with lymph node metastases reported diarrhea (grade I in three patients, grade II in two patients). Conclusion SBRT might safely and effectively be used to postpone ADT in patients with oligometastatic recurrence of prostate cancer. (Figure Presented).",inclusion,,Control sense SBRT,,,,

One third of all cancer patietns will develop brain metastases, so this entity is one of the most frequent seen by radiotherapists. Patients with brain metastases do still have a very poor prognosis, the grade prognostic assessment (GPA) is a clinical score to estimate the prognosis based on karnofsky performance score (KPS), number of lesions and extracranial metastases. But so far there are no serologic markers corelating with the damage to the brain both by growing lesions and radiation. The glial protein S100 and neuron specific enolase (NSE) both are used in the clinical setting to evaluate brain damage after traumatic brain injury and ischemic oder hemorrhage stroke. At Klinikum rechts der Isar we do now conduct a study evaluating S100 and NSE serum levels during the course of radiation therapy. (VONES100) Methods: Patients with brain metastases receiving whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) or stereotactic fractionated radiation (SFR) post resection are included in this study. Additionally we include patients undergoing propylactic cranial irradiation. Number and volume of metastases are evaluated. All patients are clinically examined (KPS and neurologic deficits) and S100 and NSE are measured right before the first and after the last fraction. Result(s): So far 7 patients (4 females, 3 males) are inrolled into this study. Mean age was 63.1 years (39-77), 5 patients were receiving whole brain radiation therapy, one patient underwent fractionated radiation post tumor resection and one patient received PCI.

The impact of hypofractionated treatment on sexual function, irritative symptoms, and voiding symptoms has not been determined within the same patient population. Here we present our institutional data on sexual function, voiding function, irritative symptoms, and treatment response following SBRT. METHODS: This retrospective analysis includes 102 non-metastatic patients treated with SBRT at a single institution between May 2008 and September 2014. The course of radiotherapy consisted of 36.25 Gy (range 35-40) over five daily fractions. International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM), and PSA were recorded at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months after treatment. RESULTS: Median patient age was 72 years old with a median follow-up of 4.3 years. Pretreatment IPSS-I score was 5.21, increasing to 6.97 (p < .001) after 1 month. The mean IPSS-I score returned close to baseline after 3 months to 5.86 and decreased to below baseline after 2 years to 5.09. At 3 months, 9 months, and 2 years, 47.5, 76.2, and 91.1% of patients had reached IPSS-I resolution. The mean IPSS-O score prior to treatment was 5.31 and there was an increase in the score to 6.45 (p = 0.344) at 1 month. The score remained close to baseline and decreased to 4.00 at 2 years and significantly decreased to 3.74 (p = 0.035) at 3 years. 64.4, 82.1, and 96.0% of patients had IPSS-O resolution by 3 months, 9 months, and 2 years. The mean SHIM score prior to treatment was 13.52 and continually decreased to below baseline a year after treatment to 10.56 (p < .001). SHIM score began to improve at 18 months, but was still significantly less than baseline at 12.12 (p = .01). CONCLUSIONS: While an increase in AUA/IPSS score initially occurred, all patients resume normal activities immediately following treatment and the AUA/IPSS symptoms improved from baseline. Irittative symptoms take longer to resolve when compared to obstructive voiding symptoms in patients treated with SBRT. Three year PSA response, reported toxicity, erectile function preservation, and urinary function improvement, shows favorable results.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.1186/s13014-015-0488-3,,,

However, there is no solid evidence about the optimal treatment schedule and no comprehensive understanding of the adverse events. In this study, we sought to compare two most widely used SSRS schemes (single fraction versus three fractions) in patients with spinal metastasis who did not previously undergo radiation treatment at the site of the SSRS and tried to evaluate the toxicity profile as well as predictive factors regarding outcomes and the risk of complications after SSRS. Material and Methods Patients were prospectively enrolled in the singleinstitution randomized study. Dose regimen was singlefraction of 16-Gy versus 3-fraction of 24-Gy. The primary objective is the rate of 4-month grade 3 or higher adverse events definitely, probably or possibly related to treatment. Spinal Instability Neoplastic Scoring (SINS) system were incorporated into the protocol to predict the adverse event of each anticipant. Local control was determined by serial post-treatment image scans. Results Between 2015/11 and 2017/5, SSRS was performed in 23 sites on 20 patients (including 18 lung cancer patients, 1 breast cancer patient and 1 prostate cancer patient). The median age was 58 years (range 45-79). The median KPS was 80 (range 70-100). Of the 23 sites, 20 were single level targets. Thoracic spine (n = 15) and lumbar spine (n=7) were the most common sites. Single fraction radiosurgery was delivered in 11 patients while 3-fraction regimen was delivered in 9 patients. Median follow-up was 11.03 months (95% confidence interval: 8.26-13.81 months). At 4 months, no patient experienced any grade 3-5 toxicity. Pain flare was not reported in the irradiated sites. There was no evidence of vertebral body fracture related to the SSRS in any patient in the treated area. Conclusion Both single fraction and three fraction SSRS could provide durable and favorable pain and local control for patients who have previously unirradiated spinal metastasis with mild/tolerable toxicity profile.",exclusion,"Wrong patients, other intervention",,,,,

Nelfinavir is a HIV protease inhibitor that may potentially act as a radiosensitizer. We performed a Phase II study of nelfinavir concurrent with SBRT in pts with solid tumor oligometastases to determine 6-month (6mo) freedom from local progression (FFLP). Secondary endpoints include safety, overall survival (OS), freedom from distant metastasis (FFDM) and progression-free survival (PFS).

The majority of pts had <=3 lesion sites (54% had 1 lesion, 22% had 2, and 16% had 3), and had recurrence sites at bone (57%) or lung (24%). The 6 mo FFLP rate was 78.4% (95% CI: 61.4-88.5%). Among the 68 treated lesions, the 6mo FFLP rate by lesion was 76.5% (95% CI: 64.5-84.9%). There were a total of 3 deaths due to disease progression. The 18 mo rates of OS, FFDM, and PFS were 90.7% (95% CI: 73.8-96.9), 62.4% (95% CI: 43.9-76.3), 57.6% (95% CI: 39.7-72.0), respectively. The 6 mo FFLP rate for patients with prostate cancer was 100% compared to 63% for patients with sarcoma (P < 0.0003). There were 4 grade 3 adverse events that may have been related to treatment (e.g., absolute lymphocyte decrease, anxiety, nausea, and cough). Conclusion(s): SBRT can be delivered safely with nelfinavir. Overall 6 mo FFLP rate for the entire cohort was not significantly higher than historical controls, although this may be secondary to tumor histology, treated site, and lesion number. Prostate cancer patients had significantly improved clinical outcomes relative to sarcoma patients and thus one may hypothesize that certain histologies may require a higher SBRT dose for local control. Further research should be conducted into the optimum patient cohort to benefit from the concurrent use of radiosensitizers with SBRT.",exclusion,Wrong intervention,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.06.544,,,

Material and Methods Between November 2015 and December 20 16, 30 hormone-naive patients were enrolled in an IRB-approved prospectively randomized phase II study to receive either 45Gy in 5 consecutive daily fractions (Hypo-SBRT) or 24Gy SDRT. This protocol was based on a previous phase I/II single arm hypofractionated study of intermediate-risk prostate cancer (5x9Gy daily, in 200 patients accrued between 05/2013 and 09/2016) and a phase I pilot study of 24Gy SDRT of stage IV prostate cancer with radiationand surgery-naive prostates failing androgen ablation using the same technique as implemented in the presently reported randomized trial. Treatment in both arms was based on VMAT-IGRT with urethral sparing via a dose-painting technique and realtime motion management with beacon transponders. The PTV included the prostate gland and seminal vesicles, and a 2 mm margin beyond the CTV. Precise PTV targeting and anatomical reproducibility was achieved via placement of an endorectal air-filled balloon (150 cc) and a Foley catheter. This setup also conferred organ motion mitigation, and online tracking ensured treatment delivery within the 2 mm PTV margin. Genito-urinary (GU) and gastro-intestinal (GI) toxicity were graded according to the NCI CTCAE v.4, and QoL was assessed by EPIC and IPSS questionnaires. Tumor response was assessed biochemically (PSA) and by follow-up MRI at 3 months after treatment and at 6 months intervals thereafter. Results A total of 15 patients were accrued to each protocol arm. Within a median follow-up of 16 months (range, 11-24), no grade >=2 acute GI or GU toxicities were observed in either group. Grade 1 GU and GI toxicities were 18% and 0% in the hypo arm respectively, and 41% and 8% in the SDRT arm respectively. There were no significant differences in mean EPIC scores in all domains. An initial 6% and 8% drop in the EPIC urinary domain score occurred in the hypo and SDRT arm respectively, returning to baselines by 3 months. Similarly, at one month median IPSS values increased from 7 to 11 and from 7 to 10, in the hypo and SDRT arms respectively, returning to baseline by 3-months. PSA reduction kinetics were also similar between the two regimens, reaching <=1 ng/mL by 18 months. Of note, all cases, regardless of treatment regimen, converted to non-detectable disease on mutiparametric MRI. Patients in this trial will receive a planned 24 months post-treatment biopsy to validate treatment outcome. Conclusion These early trial outcomes indicate that 24Gy SDRT can be consistently and safely delivered, yielding the same low acute toxicity as demonstrated with the hypo 5x9Gy schedule, and is associated with excellent QoL measures. Further planned endpoints (i.e. late toxicity, long-term biochemical outcomes, and 24 months post-treatment biopsy) are pending.",exclusion,,,,,,

No recommendations are available concerning dose schedule, and available studies report the use of multiple-fraction regimens due to theoretical lower toxicity and higher cumulative dose delivered to the target. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a dose-intensive, single-fraction SBRT regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective data on outcome and toxicity from 27 treatments on 23 consecutive patients were collected. Statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 22 months (range 6-63, interquartile range 15-28). Biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS) at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years were 65%, 40%, and 26%, respectively.

Objective(s): To perform a matched-case analysis in men with lymph node recurrent PCa comparing standard of care (SOC) with metastasis-directed therapy (MDT). Design, setting, and participants: PCa patients with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression following multimodality treatment were included in this retrospective multi-institutional analysis. Intervention(s): The SOC cohort (n = 1816) received immediate or delayed androgen deprivation therapy administered at PSA progression. The MDT cohort (n = 263) received either salvage lymph node dissection (n = 166) or stereotactic body radiotherapy (n = 97) at PSA progression to a positron emission tomography-detected nodal recurrence. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The primary endpoint, cancer-specific survival (CSS), was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, Cox proportional hazards models, and propensity score-matched analyses. Results and limitations: At a median follow-up of 70 (interquartile range: 48-98) mo, MDT was associated with an improved CSS on univariate (p = 0.029) and multivariate analysis (hazard ratio: 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17-0.64) adjusted for the year of radical prostatectomy (RP), age at RP, PSA at RP, time from RP to PSA progression, Gleason score, surgical margin status, pT- and pN-stage. In total, 659 men were matched (3:1 ratio). The 5-yr CSS was 98.6% (95% CI: 94.3-99.6) and 95.7% (95% CI: 93.2-97.3) for MDT and SOC, respectively (p = 0.005, log-rank). The main limitations of our study are its retrospective design and lack of standardization of systemic treatment in the SOC cohort. Conclusion(s): MDT for nodal oligorecurrent PCa improves CSS as compared with SOC.

random-journal.pdf,ProM193,"T., Steuber",2017,English,pro.m,Standard of care versus metastasis-directed therapy for nodal oligorecurrent prostate cancer following multimodality treatment: A case-control study,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: There are several retrospective series regarding metastasis-directed therapy (MDT), in the form of either salvage lymphadenectomy (sPLND) or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), to PET-positive lymph node recurrences after initial radical prostatectomy (RP) and postoperative radiotherapy (PORT). However, these studies are single arm studies without a control group of patients not receiving MDT, which is still considered standard of care (SOC). We pooled data from 5 institutions and performed a retrospective case-control study to assess the influence of MDT to pelvic lymph node metastasis on cancer-specific survival (CSS). METHOD(S): The SOC-cohort consisted of 2270 men who underwent RP+PORT (adjuvant or salvage) between 1996-2013 at a single institution (Hamburg) and experienced subsequent biochemical failure managed with systemic treatment administered at physicians 0 discretion. The MDT-cohort comprised 227 patients treated with RP+PORT between 1996-2013 who experienced a biochemical recurrence (BCR) followed by a Choline or PSMA PET-detected nodal recurrence. This recurrence was managed with either sPLND (n= 150) or SBRT (n= 77). In case of further systemic progression, systemic treatment was administered at physicians' discretion Disease characteristics and the impact of MDT on cancer-specific survival (CSS) was assessed using Cox proportional hazard models. CSS was measured from time of BCR following RP+PORT. A propensity- score matched pair analysis between SOC and MDT patients was performed based on known prognostic factors at initial diagnosis (PSA prior to RP, year of RP, RP Gleason Grade, age, pN-status and pT stage). RESULT(S): In total, 384 were matched (187:187) with a median follow-up of 64.2 months. Type of treatment (SOC vs. MDT), age at RP, RP Gleason Grade and margin status were significantly associated with cancer-specific survival in multivariate analysis (all p<0.05). After matched-pair analysis, 10 year CSS was 79.4% (95% CI 66.5-88.2)for SOC and 98.8% (95% CI 91.4-98.8) for MDT(p= 0.002). CONCLUSION(S): MDT to pelvic nodal recurrences of PCa is associated with improved CSS compared to SOC. These data should be considered hypothesis-generating and inform future randomized trials in this setting. (Figure Presented).",exclusion,Wrong comparator,,,,,

The incidence varies between 20 and 85% depending on the primary cancer. Breast, prostate, and lung cancers are responsible for 70% of bone metastases. Cancer with bone metastases compared to other metastatic sites is considered as associated with a better prognosis, particularly for breast and prostate cancer. Bone metastases may be present at diagnosis (synchronous metastasis) or appear at a later time (metachronous metastasis). The concept of ""oligometastases"" was proposed in patients with about 3 up to 5 metastases (without restriction on the primary site) and associated with an intermediate prognosis. It was hypothesized that local treatment with curative intent, aiming at the few metastatic sites, would yield long_term survival probabilities, along with systemic therapies. Long_term survivors have been reported after curative_intent treatment of metastasis in sarcoma and colorectal cancers with liver or lung metastasis. We chose to focus on bone metastasis because of their high incidence, their impact on the patient's quality of life and autonomy, and their accessibility to potentially curative radiotherapy. The systemic treatment of metastatic cancer includes hormonal therapy (breast and prostate cancer), biologically_targeted drugs and chemotherapy (all cancers). Stereotactic radiotherapy is a highly accurate technique was initially developed for performing the radiosurgery of brain tumors in patients for whom it was deemed be too difficult to proceed to classical excision surgery. In this process, a high total dose of radiation is delivered in a single fraction to a well_defined intra_cranial target. The concept of radiotherapy in stereotactic conditions was extended to one or several fractions delivered to small volumes primary tumors/ metastases in extra_cranial sites (Stereotactic Body RadioTherapy [SBRT]). At present, high control rates have been achieved for lung metastases. Similarly, very high local control rates have been reported in bone metastases after stereotactic radiotherapy. In this protocol, our purpose is to demonstrate, via a randomized phase III trial, that high doses of radiotherapy, delivered in stereotactic conditions to the bone metastases (between 1 and 3 metastases) in solid tumor patients is able to improve the survival without progression.",exclusion,No comparator,,,,,

The importance of this treatment paradigm in prostate cancer is a rapidly evolving field. Herein, we report on the safety and preliminary clinical outcomes of a modern cohort of oligometastatic prostate cancer (OPC) patients treated with consolidative stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR). METHODS: Records of men with OPC who underwent consolidative SABR at our institution were reviewed. SABR was delivered in 1-5 fractions of 5-18 Gray. Kaplan-Meier estimates of local progression-free survival (LPFS), biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS; PSA nadir + 2), distant progression-free survival (DPFS), and time-to-next intervention (TTNI) were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 66 OPC patients were identified with consolidative SABR delivered to 134 metastases: 89 bone, 40 nodal, and 5 viscera. The majority of men (49/66) had hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC). Crude grade 1 and 2 acute toxicities were 36% and 11%, respectively, with no ≥ grade 3 toxicity. At 1 year, LPFS was 92% and bPFS and DPFS were 69%. Of the 18 men with HSPC who had deferred hormone therapy , 11 (56%) remain disease free following SABR (1-year ADT-FS was 78%).

The importance of consolidating all macroscopic tumor deposits in prostate cancer in the modern era is an unanswered question. Stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR) is highly focused, high-dose radiation that is ideally suited for treatment of oligometastatic patients. Here we report on the safety and preliminary clinical outcomes of a modern cohort of oligometastatic prostate cancer (OPC) patients treated with consolidative SABR at a single institution. Materials/Methods: Records of all men with OPC, defined as up to 5 metastases (bone, lymph nodes and viscera) diagnosed on imaging (bone scan, CT, MRI or PET), who underwent consolidative SABR at our institution were reviewed. Demographic, pathologic, clinical and concurrent-adjuvant therapy data were collected from our IRB approved departmental prostate cancer radiation therapy registry. SABR was delivered in 1-5 fractions of 5-18 Gy using linear accelerator or robotic stereotactic technology. Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess local progression-free survival (LPFS), biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS; nadir+2) and distant progression-free survival (DPFS). Result(s): In total, 46 OPC patients were identified with 16 (35%) of those men presenting as synchronous OPC undergoing complete consolidation of primary and all metastatic sites. The remaining 30 men had recurrent or metachronous OPC. Median and mean follow-up was 27 and 33 weeks, respectively. The majority of men (36/46 or 78%) had hormone sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) at the time of SABR with the remaining (10/46 or 22%) having castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Most men were treated with concurrent hormonal therapy (37/46 or 81%). In total consolidative SABR was delivered to 92 metastases: 71 bone (77%), 18 nodal (20%) and 3 (3%) visceral metastases. Overall LPFS at 1-year was 75% and 100% for SABR biologically effective doses >40. The bPFS and DPFS at 1-year were 72.7% and 73.5%, respectively. Crude Grade 1 and 2 acute toxicity were low at 30% and 5%, respectively, with no Grade 3 or higher acute toxicity. Conclusion(s): Consolidative SABR in men with OPC is feasible and well tolerated. The heterogeneity and small size of our series limits interpretation of clinically meaningful outcomes following consolidative SABR in OPC, but our preliminary data suggests this approach is worthy of further prospective study.

Some men with mCRPC may present at some point with oligometastases, a state between loco-regional and widespread metastatic disease with metastases being limited both in number and location. This oligometastatic state exists De novo, can be induced by effective systemic therapies, or may present under the picture of oligoprogression. The latter is a situation where >=3-5 metastatic tumor sites progress, while all other metastases are controlled by ongoing systemic therapy. The typical practice would be to change systemic therapy at this point. SABR is an emerging treatment option for oligometastatic or oligoprogressive malignancies. Used for this indication SABR may improve survival and delay the need to change systemic therapy. However, some patients may derive limited benefit only because of early and widespread metastatic progression following SABR. While there are no validated biomarkers to predict these two scenarios to date, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a minimally invasive and highly informative biomarker platform for identifying molecular changes associated with treatment outcome. Trial design: In the absence of published evidence on the use of SABR for oligoprogressive mCRPC in men undergoing abiraterone therapy, we are conducting a phase I study to determine the incidence of acute and late toxicities (primary endpoint) associated with delivering SABR to all oligoprogressive metastatic sites in 30 men with mCRPC on abiraterone. We also aim to collect preliminary efficacy data of such an approach as secondary endpoints (eg time to biochemical, radiological and/or symptomatic progression following SABR). Using conventional imaging, eligible mCRPC candidates will be identified based on<=5 SABR amenable progressive metastatic lesions (<=3 in any one organ system) while all other metastases remain stable or are responding to abiraterone therapy. Before SABR, we will collect ctDNA to perform gene copy number and mutational analyses of prostate cancer relevant genes as a means to predict sustained responses to SABR.",exclusion,"other study, no comparator",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdx370.057,,,

We performed a randomized trial to study the impact of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) in patients presenting with metachronous oligometastases. Methods: Eligible patients had a controlled primary malignancy with 1_5 metastatic lesions, all of which were suitable for SABR, had an ECOG performance status 0_1, and life expectancy >6 months. Stratification was by number of metastases (1_3 vs. 4_5). Randomization was in a 1:2 ratio between palliative standard of care (SOC) [Arm 1] vs. SOC plus SABR to all metastatic lesions [Arm 2]. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). A randomized phase II screening design was employed with a two_sided alpha of 0.20 (wherein a p_value <0.20 designates a positive trial) to provide an initial comparison of the two treatment strategies. Secondary endpoints included progression_free survival (PFS), toxicity, and QOL (assessed using the FACT_G). Results: Between 2012_2016, 99 patients were randomized (33 in Arm 1, 66 in Arm 2) at centres in Canada, Europe and Australia.

SABR delivers precise, high-dose, hypofractionated radiotherapy, and achieves excellent rates of local control for primary tumors or metastases. A recent randomized phase II trial evaluated SABR in a group of patients with a small burden of oligometastatic disease (mostly with 1-3 metastatic lesions), and found that SABR was associated with benefits in progression-free survival and overall survival. The goal of this phase III trial is to assess the impact of SABR in patients with 4-10 metastatic cancer lesions. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-nine patients will be randomized in a 1:2 ratio between the control arm (consisting of standard of care palliative-intent treatments), and the SABR arm (consisting of standard of care treatment + SABR to all sites of known disease). Randomization will be stratified by two factors: histology (Group 1: prostate, breast, or renal; Group 2: all others), and type of pre-specified systemic therapy (Group 1: immunotherapy/targeted; Group 2: cytotoxic; Group 3: observation). SABR is to be completed within 2 weeks, allowing for rapid initiation of systemic therapy.

However, long-term randomized data that test this paradigm are lacking. METHODS: We enrolled patients with a controlled primary malignancy and 1-5 metastatic lesions, with all metastases amenable to stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). We stratified by the number of metastases (1-3 v 4-5) and randomized in a 1:2 ratio between palliative standard-of-care (SOC) treatments (arm 1) and SOC plus SABR (arm 2).

Evidence from randomised controlled trials to support this paradigm is scarce. We aimed to assess the effect of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) on survival, oncological outcomes, toxicity, and quality of life in patients with a controlled primary tumour and one to five oligometastatic lesions. Method(s): This randomised, open-label phase 2 study was done at 10 hospitals in Canada, the Netherlands, Scotland, and Australia. Patients aged 18 or older with a controlled primary tumour and one to five metastatic lesions, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of 0-1, and a life expectancy of at least 6 months were eligible. After stratifying by the number of metastases (1-3 vs 4-5), we randomly assigned patients (1:2) to receive either palliative standard of care treatments alone (control group), or standard of care plus SABR to all metastatic lesions (SABR group), using a computer-generated randomisation list with permuted blocks of nine. Neither patients nor physicians were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival. We used a randomised phase 2 screening design with a two-sided alpha of 0.20 (wherein p<0.20 designates a positive trial). All analyses were intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01446744. Finding(s): 99 patients were randomised between Feb 10, 2012, and Aug 30, 2016. Of 99 patients, 33 (33%) were assigned to the control group and 66 (67%) to the SABR group. Two (3%) patients in the SABR group did not receive allocated treatment and withdrew from the trial; two (6%) patients in the control group also withdrew from the trial. Median follow-up was 25 months (IQR 19-54) in the control group versus 26 months (23-37) in the SABR group. Median overall survival was 28 months (95% CI 19-33) in the control group versus 41 months (26-not reached) in the SABR group (hazard ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.30-1.10; p=0.090). Adverse events of grade 2 or worse occurred in three (9%) of 33 controls and 19 (29%) of 66 patients in the SABR group (p=0.026), an absolute increase of 20% (95% CI 5-34). Treatment-related deaths occurred in three (4.5%) of 66 patients after SABR, compared with none in the control group. Interpretation(s): SABR was associated with an improvement in overall survival, meeting the primary endpoint of this trial, but three (4.5%) of 66 patients in the SABR group had treatment-related death.

Our study evaluates the efficacy and safety of SABR using the CyberKnife system for treating intermediate- to very-high-risk prostate cancer. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Between May 2010 and June 2013, 31 patients (15 intermediate risk, 14 high risk, and 2 very high risk) without pelvic lymph node metastasis were enrolled retrospectively. The treatment consisted of 37.5 Gy in 5 fractions over 1-2 weeks using CyberKnife SABR. Twenty-five patients (81%) received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Biochemical failure was defined using the nadir + 2 criterion. Toxicity was assessed with the Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (version 4). RESULTS: The median follow-up was 36 months (range 7-58 months). The median pretreatment prostate--pecific antigen (PSA) was 13.5 ng/mL (range 4.5-124.0 ng/mL). The median PSA decreased to 0.09 ng/mL (range <0.04-5.38 ng/mL) and 0.12 ng/mL (range <0.04-2.63 ng/mL) at 6 months and 12 months after SABR, respectively. The 3-year biochemical relapse-free survival was 90.2% for all patients, 100% for the intermediate-risk patients, and 82% for the high- and very-high-risk patients (p = 0.186). No patient experienced ≥ grade 3 toxicity. There were 7 acute and 5 late grade 2 genitourinary toxicities and 1 acute and no late grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results support that CyberKnife SABR with ADT is safe and feasible in patients with intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer.

In this setting, local treatments could impact on disease control, survival of patients and management of systemic treatments. Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is considered a non-invasive and well tolerated local approach. The aim of this report is to evaluate the outcome and change in systemic approach of oligometastatic PCa patients treated with SBRT. Material(s) and Method(s): From 2009 to 2016, 65 patients were treated with SBRT on 90 metastases. Patients with the evidence of 1 to 3 treated metastases were included. The Clinical Target Volume included the macroscopic disease and microscopic extension based on the computed tomography (CT) images eventually registered with 11C-choline-positron emission tomography (PET) scan imaging. The treatment was executed with the RapidArc version of volumetric modulated arc therapy and was erogated with a median dose of 42 Gy (range=18-60 Gy) in 2-8 fractions. Clinical outcome was evaluated every 3 months, with prostatespecific antigen (PSA) determination and, in the majority of patients, with post-treatment 11C-choline-PET. Local control (LC), biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS) and time to initiation of new systemic therapy were evaluated. Result(s): Median time from detection of metastases to SBRT was 1.85 months (range=0-58.5). Patients were more commonly treated on abdominal or pelvic lymph nodes (50 patients, 78.1%); two (3.1%) patients were treated on lymph node and bone metastases while 10 (15.6%) patients only on bone lesions. Lung metastases were treated in 2 (3.1%) patients. Forty-one (64.1%) patients were treated on 1 single metastases while 20 (31.2%) and 3 (4.7%) patients on 2 and 3 metastases, respectively. Thirty-seven (57.81%) patients were free from systemic therapy when treated with SBRT. Thirty-seven (57.8%) patients were castration-sensitive while 28 (42.2%) patients were castration-resistant. Median follow-up time was 15.2 months (range 6-101.4 months). Best radiologic response after SBRT was classified as Complete Response in 41 (64.1%) patients, partial response in 10 (15.6%) patients and stable disease in 2 (3.1%) patients. Median value of nadir PSA reached after SBRT in the whole group was 1.64 ng/ml (range=0-45.05). Median nadir value of PSA in patients without progression after RT was 0.39 ng/ml (range=0.01-5.8 ng/ml). LC at 6-, 12- and 18- months was 94%, 88% and 84% respectively. Median time to local relapse was 14.1 months (range=2.5-101.4). Forty-three patients had biochemical relapse during followup with a median time of 7.1 months (range=1.1-42.7). Rates of BPFS at 6, 12, and 18 months were 73%, 41%, and 28%, respectively. Median time from radiotherapy to the onset of new systemic treatment was 10.1 months (range 1.6-47.1). Conclusion(s): SBRT is an effective approach for the treatment of metastases from PCa, giving the possibility to delay the onset of systemic treatments. The low value of PFS rates implies the need of randomized prospective trials to select the patients who will benefit the most from this local approach.",exclusion,No comparator,,,,,

In this phase II study, stereotactic body radiation treatment was delivered by volumetric modulated arc therapy with flattening filter free beams and was gated using real-time electromagnetic transponder system to maximize precision of radiotherapy and, potentially, to reduce toxicities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients affected by histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) intermediate class of risk were enrolled in this phase II study. Beacon transponders were positioned transrectally within the prostate parenchyma 7 to 10 days before simulation computed tomography scan. The radiotherapy schedule was 38Gy in 4 fractions delivered every other day. Toxicity assessment was performed according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), v4.0. RESULT(S): Thirty-six patients were enrolled in this study. Median initial prostate-specific antigen was 7.0ng/mL (range: 2.3 to 14.0ng/mL). Median nadir-prostate-specific antigen after treatment was 0.2ng/mL (range: 0.006 to 4.8ng/mL). A genitourinary acute toxicity was observed in 21 patients (dysuria grade [G] 1: 41.7%, G2: 16.7%). Gastrointestinal acute toxicity was found in 9 patients (proctitis G1: 19.4%, G2: 5.6%). Late toxicity was mild (genitourinary toxicity G1: 30.6%; G2: 8.3%; gastrointestinal toxicity G1: 13.9%; G2: 19.4%).

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed records of patients treated with SBRT for oligometastatic PCa. Metastasis control (ie, control of the treated lesion, MC), biochemical progression-free survival, distant progression-free survival, and overall survival were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Sixty-six men with 81 metastatic PCa lesions, 50 of which were castrate-resistant, were included in the analysis. Lesions were in bone (n=74), lymph nodes (n=6), or liver (n=1). Stereotactic body radiation therapy was delivered in 1 fraction to 71 lesions (88%), at a median dose of 16 Gy (range, 16-24 Gy). The remaining lesions received 30 Gy in 3 fractions (n=6) or 50 Gy in 5 fractions (n=4). Median follow-up was 16 months (range, 3-49 months). Estimated MC at 2 years was 82%. Biochemical progression-free survival, distant progression-free survival, and overall survival were 54%, 45%, and 83%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, only the dose of SBRT was significantly associated with MC; lesions treated with 16 Gy had 58% MC, and those treated with ≥18 Gy had 95% MC at 2 years (P≤.001). At 2 years, MC for lesions treated with 18 Gy (n=21) was 88%. No patient treated with ≥18 Gy in a single fraction or with any multifraction regimen had local failure. Six patients (9%) had grade 1 pain flare, and 2 (3%) had grade 2 pain flare. No grade 2 or greater late toxicities were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic body radiation therapy for patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer provided optimal metastasis control and acceptable toxicity with doses ≥18 Gy. Biochemical progression-free survival was 54% at 16 months with the inclusion of SBRT in the treatment regimen.

The use of SBRT in this clinical setting has been reported to confer local control rate in excess of 90%, and encouraging progression free survival rate with no significant treatment -related toxicities1-4. One of the goals with this approach is to delay initiation of palliative systemic treatment, which can potentially impact negatively on quality of life. This study evaluated the outcomes of SBRT in our cohort. Material(s) and Method(s): Forty five patients diagnosed with oligometastatic prostate cancer (defined as a rising PSA and positive CT/PET choline scan) after definitive local therapy were treated with 1-2 courses of SBRT between July 2011 and July 2015. Over 90% of metastases were situated in lymph nodes or bone. Median dose was 30 Gy in 3 fractions, prescribed to the highest isodose covering the PTV. Retrospective data collection and analysis were performed for these patients. Kaplan-Meier was utilised to estimate progression free survival and overall survival and time to initiation of systemic treatment. Nineteen of the 35 patients with castration sensitive disease were treated with SBRT alone for their oligometastatic disease, 16 patients received SBRT and Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) with median duration of 5 months. 10 patients who were castration resistant at the diagnosis of oligometastases were treated with SBRT with ongoing systemic treatment. Result(s): The median follow-up was 29 months (range 6-60 months). Local control rate of lesions following SBRT treatment was 90%, overall progression free survival (PFS) was 38%, overall survival (OS) of 89% at 29 months. A reduction of pre-treatment PSA value of 48% and 75%, respectively was seen in castration sensitive patients who received SBRT alone and SBRT with ADT, and a 25% PSA reduction in castration resistant patients treated with SBRT and ADT. Median time to clinical progression was longer in castration sensitive patients treated with SBRT and ADT compared to SBRT alone (13 months vs 25 months). The median ADT-free survival for castration sensitive patients was 16 months. Median time to initiation of next line therapy in castration resistant patients following SBRT treatment was 6 months. No grade 3 or 4 treatment related toxicities reported. Conclusion(s): SBRT can provide a substantial delay to the next initiation of systemic therapy in castration sensitive patients whilst for castration resistant patients, there is a modest prolongation before initiation of subsequent therapy.

Hormone-sensitive and castrate-resistant patients with oligometastatic (≤ 3) bone-only prostate cancer treated with SBRT were included. Data were collected using electronic records. Kaplan-Meier survivor function, log rank test, as well as Cox regression were used to calculate PFS and overall survival. RESULTS: In total, 51 patients with 64 bone metastases treated with SBRT were included. Nine patients were castrate resistant and 42 patient's hormone sensitive at the time of SBRT. Median follow-up was 23 months. Median PFS was 24 months in hormone-sensitive patients and 3 months in castrate-resistant patients. No patients experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicities. There were three in-field recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, patients with bone oligometastatic disease showed potential benefit from SBRT with a median PFS of 11 months. Hormone-sensitive patients showed the greatest benefit, with results similar to that published for oligometastatic pelvic nodal disease treated with SBRT. Prospective randomised control trials are needed to determine the survival benefit of SBRT in oligometastatic bone-only prostate cancer and to determine prognostic indicators.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.1007/s00345-019-02873-w,,,

These patients are usually treated in the same way as those with distant metastases by means of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT). We want to report the outcome of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) for oligorecurrent nodal PCa. MATERIAL & METHODS: This was a retrospective multicentre analysis of patients diagnosed with 3 metachronous nodal recurrences treated with SBRT. SBRT was defined as a radiotherapy dose of at least 5 Gy per fraction to a Biological Effective Dose (BED) of at least 80 Gy to all metastatic sites. The study was approved by the central ethics committee (EC2014/ 0199). Inclusion criteria were as follows: histologically proven diagnosis of PCa, biochemical relapse of PCa after radical local prostate treatment and the detection of up to three N1 or M1a lesions. Patients were excluded in the case of M1b or M1c lesions, serum testosterone levels 12 months with SBRT, previous pelvic radiotherapy, biochemical relapse while on active treatment with a systmemic agent for PCa. The primary endpoint was Distant Progression-Free Survival (DPFS), defined as the time interval between the first day of SBRT and appearance of new metastatic lesions, outside the high-dose region. Secondary endpoints were local control, time to start of palliative ADT and toxicity scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0. RESULT(S): Overall, 171 metastases were detected (84% with choline PET-CT) and treated with SBRT in 134 patients. The median follow-up from SBRT was 29 mo (IQR: 13-47). Adjuvant ADT was given in 33% of patients for a median duration of 6 mo (IQR: 1-8 mo). The median DPFS was 21 mo (95% CI: 18-24 mo) with 80% of patients having <=3 metastases at time of progression. The 3-year local progression rate was 41% for patients treated with a BED 100Gy (p<0.001). The median time from first SBRT to the start of palliative ADT was 25 mo (95% CI: 18 - 32). Late grade I and II toxicity was observed in 10% (N=13) and 4% of patients (N=6). No grade 3 toxicity was observed. ZCONCLUSIONS: SBRT for oligometastatic PCa nodal recurrence is safe.

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) provides a potential for cure in a selected group of patients with oligometastatic PCa in the PSMA-PET era. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a prospective, single-centre study of patients with oligometastatic PCa undergoing SBRT from November 2014 to July 2016. We included patients with relapsed PCa receiving SBRT with PSMA-PET-confirmed oligometastases (n=1-3) confined to lymph nodes (LNs) or bone without androgen deprivation therapy. SBRT schedules included 20Gy/1# or 24Gy/2# to bone metastases, and 50Gy/5# or 30Gy/3# to LNs. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint was biochemical failure (BF) defined as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of nadir + 0.2 ng/ml following SBRT. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Fifty-seven patients were eligible, of whom 50 (88%) had undergone radical prostatectomy. The median time from definitive treatment to SBRT was 5.6 yr. A total of 73 lesions were treated: 44 patients had one metastasis, while 13 had two or three. Thirty-seven patients (65%) had LN-only disease, while 18 (31%) had bone-only metastasis. Median follow up was 16 mo. The median biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) for the cohort was 11 mo, with 31.9% bDFS at 15 mo. All patients with BF (n=43) underwent a repeat PSMA-PET scan, which revealed no in-field failures. Median bDFS was not affected by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at diagnosis, Gleason score, time from diagnosis to SBRT, site (bone vs LN), PSA doubling time before SBRT, or number of metastases. Failures were somewhat less common in patients with low PSA before SBRT. Toxicity was rare: no patients developed grade ≥2 late toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: SBRT delivered very high rates of local control with minimal toxicity. However, distant recurrences occurred in most patients by 15 mo and did not appear to be predicted by known prognostic factors. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report, we looked at outcomes after the use of stereotactic body radiotherapy for patients with prostate cancer spread to one to three lymph nodes or bones as detected by positron emission tomography scans. We demonstrated high rates of control of the treated lesions with low toxicity, but by 15 mo more than two-thirds of patients had developed recurrent cancer outside the treated area.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.1016/j.euo.2018.04.017,,,

Material and Methods In this retrospective study, we analyzed castrate and noncastrate patients treated by SBRT between November 2011 and April 2016 for 1 to 3 metastases, bone or node, diagnosed on a positron emission tomography - computed tomography (PET-CT) or on a bone-scintigraphy with technetium-99, following biochemical recurrence of a prostate cancer after a local curative treatment. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was the primary end-point defined as the time interval between the first day of SBRT and biochemical failure, defined as 2 consecutive elevations of PSA with last dosage superior to PSA dosage before treatment, or clinical failure, defined as new metastases found on an imaging check-up (PET-CT or scintigraphy). PSA dosage before SBRT, type of metastase (bone or node), number of lesions treated in SBRT, patient's ages, nadir of PSA after SBRT, and concomittant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were analyzed in univariate and multivariate logistic regression to identify pronostic factors of poor response to SBRT. Results With a median follow-up from time of SBRT of 12 months, we treated 40 patients and 56 metastatic lesions, with a local-control rate of 85%. 19 patients were treated for 1 to 3 bone lesions and 21 patients for 1 to 3 node lesions. 8 patients with bone oligo-metastasis and 13 patients with node oligometastasis had a recurrence. The primary involved metastatic sites were lymph nodes ( 52 %) and bone ( 52 %), with 3 patients having both node and bone recurrence . A 2nd and 3rd course of radiotherapy was delivered in 8 and 1 patients respectively. Median RFS was 345 days (134 ; 426) in the node metastatic group and 494 days (85 ; 877) in the bone metastatic group. On bivariate analysis, a PSA nadir up to 0,51 ng/mL after SBRT was identified as a pronostic factor of low RFS. This result was not confirmed in multivariate analysis. There might be a significative difference in RFS between node group and bone group. Conclusion There might appear that patients treated by SBRT for node oligometastatic prostate cancer recurrence after a local curative treatment could have a lower recurrencefree survival than patient treated for bone oligometastatic disease in the same conditions.

Material(s) and Method(s): Between 05/2012 and 09/2015 117 patients were treated (180 lymph nodes). Median age, initial PSA (iPSA), pre-SRT PSA and Gleason score (GS) were 70.3 years, 10.3 ng/mL, 4.4 ng/mL and 7, respectively. Any previous treatment was allowed. In all but 4 patients, [11C]choline-positron emission tomography/computer tomography was performed. SBRT consisted in re-irradiation and first radiotherapy for 29 (16%) and 151 (84%) lesions, respectively. Median dose was 24 Gy/3 fractions. Cyberknife- SBRT or Vero linac-SBRT was applied in 20 (11%) and 160 (89%) lymph nodes, respectively. In 56 (48%) patients androgen deprivation was added to SBRT (median duration 13.9 months), some patients were heavily pre-treated and castration-resistant. Biochemical failure was defined as post- SBRT PSA increase over pre-SBRT value. Toxicity was evaluated using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) criteria. Result(s): All patients completed planned SBRT. The median follow-up was 19.7 months. Acute toxicity included urinary (7 G1 events) and rectal complications (2 G1 events). Late toxicity included only urinary complications (2, 2, and 2 G1, G2, and G4 events, respectively). Both G4 events were temporary and were observed in pts receiving re-RT, with no dose to bladder from SBRT. Complete or partial biochemical response was observed in 68(68%) out of 100 evaluable patients. PSA stabilization was seen for 7(7%) patients and in 24(24%) cases PSA progression was reported. Clinical progression during follow up was observed in 65(65%) patients after a median time of 9 months (range: 1 - 33.1 months) from SBRT. In-field progression was observed in 13(13%) cases. 31(31%) patients had distant metastases and 34(34%) showed regional lymph node progression. All events of clinical failure were preceded by biochemical progression. At the time of the analysis (October 2015), 17(14.5%) patients are alive with no evidence of disease, 79(67.5%) are alive with clinically evident disease, 4(3.5%) died of disease and 17(14.5%) are not evaluable (due to short follow-up). Conclusion(s): Our series including 117 unselected pts showed that Vero Linac- or Cyberknife-based SBRT is feasible for oligometastatic lymph node recurrent prostate cancer offering excellent in-field tumor control and low toxicity profile. Further investigation is warranted in order to identify the patients that benefit most from this treatment modality.

This retrospective study aimed to analyze local control, biochemical progression-free survival (b-PFS), and toxicity in patients affected by isolated prostate cancer lymph node metastases. Finally, we evaluated androgen deprivation therapy-free survival (ADT-FS). METHODS: Forty patients with 47 isolated lymph nodes of recurrent prostate cancer were treated with SBRT. Mostly, two different fractionation schemes were used: 5 _ 7 Gy in 23 (48.9 %) lesions and 5 _ 8 Gy in 13 (27.7 %) lesions. Response to treatment was assessed with periodical PSA evaluation. Toxicity was registered according to RTOG/EORTC criteria. RESULTS: With a mean follow-up of 30.18 months, local control was achieved in 98 % of the cases, with a median b-PFS of 24 months. We obtained a 2-year b-PFS of 44 % with 40 % of the patients ADT-free at last follow-up (mean value 26.18 months; range 3.96-59.46), whereas 12.5 % had a mean ADT-FS of 13.58 months (range 2.06-37.13). Late toxicity was observed in one (2.5 %) patient who manifested a grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity 11.76 months after the end of SBRT.

Material(s) and Method(s): Between September 2008 and December 2014, 40 prostate cancer pts with 47 recurrent isolated LNM, were treated with SBRT. Median age was 74 yrs (range, 58-83), median Gleason score at the primary diagnosis was 7 (range, 5-10). Median and mean time from primary treatment to SBRT were 37.45 and 62.6 m, respectively (range 11.16-216.03). Diagnosis was performed with choline (ch) PET/CT, and the mean and median PSA values before SBRT were 5.6 and 4.2 ng/ml, respectively. Six (15%) pts were treated in different sessions for metachronous metastases, and one (2%) underwent SBRT for two synchronous metastases. 21 (52.5%) pts underwent only SBRT, remaining 19 (47.5%) received also androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated using choline uptake and planning target volume (PTV) was defined as the GTV plus a 5-8 mm isotropic margin. Mean and median volume of GTV and PTV were 6.63 cc and 3 cc and 25.03 and 15.03 cc, respectively. In 90% of cases 5 fractions of 6-8 Gy were delivered. Response was assessed with PSA evaluation scheduled every 3 m during the first year and then every 6 m. Pts with a reduction or a stability of PSA level were considered responders. Being evaluation of response with ch-PET-CT not mandatory, it was done in 23 (57.5%) pts. Result(s): Mean and median follow-up were 30.18 and 23.8 m, respectively (range 3.73-79.8). Mean time of biochemical progression from the end of SBRT was 15.54 m (range 1.16 - 48.86), and the 2-years biochemical progression free survival (b-PFS) was 44%. We registered a complete concordance between PSA increase and progression of disease shown at ch-PET/CT. Sixteen (40%) of the pts experienced no disease recurrence after SBRT. Of 21 no-ADT pts, 16 (76%) were still free from ADT (mean 26.18 m), whereas remaining 5 (24%) had a mean deferment time of ADT of 13.58 m. At univariate analysis, Gleason score >7 is related with a worse b-PFS (p=0.02). Acute grade 2 diarrhea was registered in 1 (2,5%) case. Grade 3 small bowel late toxicity was observed in only one (2.5%) case 11.76 m after the end of SBRT. Conclusion(s): SBRT resulted effective and generally well tolerated by pts.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed from the healthcare payer perspective to simulate the history of a 66-year-old man with low-risk PCa. The model followed patients yearly over their remaining lifetimes. Health states included 'recurrence-free', 'biochemical recurrence' (BR), 'metastatic' and 'death'. Transition probabilities were based on a retrospective cohort analysis undertaken at our institution. Utilities were derived from the literature. Costs were assigned in 2015 Canadian dollars ($) and reflected Ontario's health system and departmental costs. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. A willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000/QALY was used. RESULTS: SBRT was the dominant strategy with 0.008LYs and 0.029QALYs gained and a reduction in cost of $2615. Under base case conditions, our results were sensitive to the BR probability associated with both strategies. LDR-BT becomes the preferred strategy if the BR with SBRT is 1.3*[baseline BR_SBRT] or if the BR with LDR-BT is 0.76*[baseline BR_LDR-BT]. When assuming the same BR for both strategies, LDR-BT becomes marginally more effective with 0.009QALYs gained at a cost of $272 848/QALY.

Re-irradiation schedules have been explored in different tumour sites. In this report, we present our preliminary experience of re-irradiation using stereotactic body radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer failure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between March 2011 and October 2014, robotic stereotactic body radiation therapy was administered to patients previously treated with external-beam radiation therapy to a median dose of 71.1Gy (range, 45-76.5Gy) and with biochemical failure corresponding to a local in-field recurrence of prostate cancer. Ten patients had recurrences after postoperative external-beam radiotherapy. Patients underwent a pelvic MRI to confirm the recurrence and a total body staging using a ((18)F)-fluorocholine PET/CT. The prescription dose consisted of five fractions of 7.25Gy to a total dose of 36.25Gy. Efficacy was evaluated based on biochemical response and toxicity was evaluated according to CTCAE v.4.0 questionnaires and International Prostate Symptom Score. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were treated and followed for a median time of 11.7 months (mean: 13.4 months; range: 2.5-46.5 months). Median time between the first external-beam radiation therapy of prostate cancer and the first day of CyberKnife(®) treatment was 111 months (range: 38-398 months). One-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rate was 83.3%, and only one in-field progression was reported. Two patients had a biochemical failure corresponding to metastatic progression without evidence of local recurrence. Treatment was well tolerated, with only one grade 2 acute genitourinary toxicity, no grade≥2 acute gastrointestinal or late toxicities were reported. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic body re-irradiation therapy using CyberKnife(®) after failed external-beam radiation therapy showed favourable results in terms of in-field local and biochemical control.

Whereas brachytherapy is disadvantageous because it is an invasive procedure, stereotactic body-radiotherapy (SBRT) using CyberKnife could emulate the dose distribution of brachytherapy and is a non-invasive and safe modality to control intra-fractional movement. We therefore adopted SBRT using CyberKnife as a boost therapy after whole-pelvic radiotherapy (WPRT). METHODS/DESIGN: In this prospective, randomized, single-center, pilot study for intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer without nodal or distant metastasis, after androgen-deprivation therapy and WPRT, patients will be randomized to one of two SBRT boost regimens, i.e., 18 or 21 Gy administered in three fractions every other day. DISCUSSION: The aim of this trial is to evaluate acute toxicities using both physician- and patient-reported outcomes and short-term biochemical control with SBRT boost following WPRT. Additionally, chronic toxicities and long-term biochemical control will be evaluated as secondary endpoints in this trial.

The POPSTAR study (ANZCTR Trial ID: ACTRN12613000436774) enrolled patients with controlled primary cancer and with a presentation of one to three oligometastases. We report the interim results of patterns of failure in this cohort. MATERIAL & METHODS: Patients underwent single fraction 20Gy SABR to each of the 1-3 oligometastasis. Sites of failure after SABR were identified and classified as local, regional (nodes only) or distant. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate progression-free survival (PFS), freedom from local failure (FFLF), freedom from regional failure (FFRF) and freedom from distant failure (FFDF). RESULT(S): With a median follow up of 24 months, 33 patients with 50 oligometastases were enrolled. The mean age was 70 years (range 51-84) and the median PSA level was 6.4 ng/ml. The median time from primary cancer treatment to SABR was 2.9 years (range 0.1-13.9 years) with a primary Gleason score of >= 8 in 44% (n=14). Patients were treated with SABR to bone (n=20), pelvic nodal (n=11), extrapelvic nodal (n=1) and to both bone and nodal (n=1) sites. One, two and three oligometastatic lesions were treated in 67%, 15% and 18% of patients, respectively. No patients died in the study period. The 24-month FFLF and PFS was 93% (95% CI 84-100) and 32% (95% CI 20-54). For patients with bone only oligometastases, 24-month FFLP and FFDP was 89% and 39%. For pelvic nodal only oligometastases the 24-month FFLP, FFRP and FFDP was 100%, 34% and 45%, respectively. Relapses after SABR to pelvic nodes (n=8) were located in the pelvis only (n=4) and both pelvis and extra-pelvic nodes (n=4). Relapses after SABR to bone (n=12) occurred to bone only (n=9), bone and nodes (n=2) and only nodes (n=1), see FIGURE. Salvage RT was performed for 3/12 patients with distant relapse after SABR to bone metastases and 2/8 patients after SABR to pelvic nodes. CONCLUSION(S): For selected patients with metastatic disease, a single treatment session with SABR offers excellent infield tumour control with one third of patients being free from progressive disease at 24 months. Subsequent relapses after SABR to bone or node were generally to the same type. Salvage treatments after limited subsequent relapses are feasible and warrant further investigation.

Lesions in the brain, lung, and liver have been reported as target lesions. However, lymph node oligometastases could be a good candidate for stereotactic body radiotherapy as well. In this study, the usability of stereotactic body radiotherapy for oligometastases to lymph nodes is assessed by researching for each primary site. As a result, we could consider that stereotactic body radiotherapy could be almost well applied for lymph node oligometastases from the breast, gynecological organs, and prostate. However, doubts remain concerning the usefulness of stereotactic body radiotherapy for cervical node metastases from head and neck cancer or for mediastinal node metastases from lung or esophageal cancer since late toxicities have occurred with a large radiation dose at hypofractionation to major vessels or the central respiratory tract, especially in patients with irradiation histories. In addition, high-dose irradiation is required to control lymph node metastases from colorectal cancer due to its radio-resistance, and severe late adverse events would therefore occur in adjacent organs such as the gastrointestinal tract. In cases of lymph node oligometastases with a primary tumor in the stomach or esophagus, stereotactic body radiotherapy should be used limitedly at present because this patient population is not so large and these metastases are often located close to organs at risk. Because of the varied status of recurrence and varied conditions of patients, it is difficult to determine the optimal dose for tumor control. It might be reasonable to determine the treatment dose individually based on dose constraints of adjacent organs. The oligometastatic state is becoming more frequently identified with more sensitive methods of detecting such oligometastases. In addition, there seems to be another type of oligometastases, so-called induced oligometastases, following successful systemic treatment. To determine the optimal indication of stereotactic body radiotherapy for lymph node oligometastases, further investigation about the mechanisms of oligometastases and further clinical studies including a phase III study are needed.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.",exclusion,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1533033818803597,,,

For patients affected by this disease, a traditional radiotherapy course, lasting 7-8 weeks, remains a critical issue. Furthermore, acceleration of radiation treatment could improve therapeutic ratio, especially in intermediate-risk patients. For this reason, we designed a study of hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) delivered by volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with flattening filter-free (FFF) beams and gated using beacon transponders. We report our preliminary results on feasibility and early side-effects. Patients and Methods: Patients affected by histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma, PSA <=20 ng/ml and Gleason score (GS) 7 (NCCN intermediate class of risk), no distant metastases, no previous surgery other than transurethral resection of the prostate, no malignant tumors in the previous 5 years, IPSS <7, were enrolled in this phase II study. Patients were submitted to pelvic MRI. Beacons transponders were positioned transrectally within the prostate parenchyma (three beacons: apex, left lobe, right lobe) by an urologist; this procedure was ultrasound-guided and performed 7-10 days before simulation CT scan. Magnetic resonance images were then registered with those of simulation CT in order to better define prostate parenchyma and organs at risk. The radiotherapy schedule was 38 Gy in four fractions delivered every other day. The VMAT radiotherapy technology, with 10-MV FFF photons was used in all cases. Toxicity assessment was performed according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 scale. Result(s): Between July, 2014 and October, 2016, 25 patients were enrolled in this study. Median age was 74 (range=59-79) years, Median initial PSA was 7.0 ng/ml (range=3.1-14 ng/ml). Acute toxicities were as follows: three patients (12%) presented G1 proctitis. Genitourinary toxicity was observed in 52% of patients (n=13): in particular, seven patients had G1 cystitis (28%) with four of these presenting even G1 increased urinary frequency (16%), G2 cystitis was observed in six patients (24%) with a G2 urinary frequency observed in two of these patients (8%); a G2 urinary retention was observed in only one patient and it was treated with transient catheterization and oral and rectal medications. No acute gastrointestinal >=G2 or genito-urinary >=G3 toxicity was found. No other toxicities were observed. A rapid PSA decrease was observed in all patients. Median nadir-PSA after treatment was 0.1(range=0.1-4.8) ng/ml. At a median follow-up of 16 months (range=5-28 months, calculated from the time of diagnosis), only one patient presented an outfield relapse of disease, which was treated with androgen deprivation therapy. No other biochemical recurrences or disease progressions were observed. Conclusion(s): Preliminary findings show that stereotactic radiotherapy, delivered with FFF-VMAT and gated using beacon transponders, is a valid option for intermediate risk prostate cancer. Early results in terms of feasibility, toxicity profile and disease control are encouraging and warrant the prosecution of the study.",exclusion,No comparator,,,,,

Its role in high-risk and node-positive prostate cancer, however, is unknown. We hypothesise that a five-fraction schedule of extreme hypofractionation will be non-inferior to a moderately hypofractionated regimen over 5 weeks in efficacy and will have acceptable toxicity and quality of life while reducing the cost implications during treatment. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an ongoing, non-inferiority, multicentre, randomised trial (NCT03561961) of two schedules for National Cancer Control Network high-risk and/or node-positive non-metastatic carcinoma of the prostate. The standard arm will be a schedule of 68 Gy/25# over 5 weeks while the test arm will be extremely hypofractionated radiotherapy with stereotactic body radiation therapy to 36.25 Gy/5# (7 to 10 days). The block randomisation will be stratified by nodal status (N0/N+), hormonal therapy (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone therapy/orchiectomy) and centre. All patients will receive daily image-guided radiotherapy.The primary end point is 4-year biochemical failure free survival (BFFS). The power calculations assume 4-year BFFS of 80% in the moderate hypofractionation arm. With a 5% one-sided significance and 80% power, a total of 434 patients will be randomised to both arms equally (217 in each arm). The secondary end points include overall survival, prostate cancer specific survival, acute and late toxicities, quality of life and out-of-pocket expenditure. DISCUSSION: The trial aims to establish a therapeutically efficacious and cost-efficient modality for high-risk and node-positive prostate cancer with an acceptable toxicity profile. Presently, this is the only trial evaluating and answering such a question in this cohort. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial has been approved by IEC-III of Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai.

We aimed to assess the benefit of MDT in a randomized phase II trial. Material and Methods In this multicentre, randomised, phase II study, asymptomatic PCa patients were eligible in case of a biochemical recurrence following primary PCa treatment with curative intent, three or fewer extracranial metastatic lesions on choline PET-CT and serum testosterone levels >50 ng/ml. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either surveillance or MDT of all detected lesions (surgery or stereotactic body radiotherapy). Surveillance was done with PSA follow-up every 3 months with repeated imaging at PSA progression or clinical suspicion for progression. Randomisation was balanced dynamically on two factors: PSA doubling time (<=3 vs. > 3 months) and nodal vs non-nodal metastases. The primary endpoint was androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-free survival. ADT was started at symptomatic progression, progression to >3 metastases or local progression of known metastases. Results Between August 2012 and August 2015, 62 patients were enrolled. At a median follow-up time of 3 years (IQR 2.3 - 3.75), the median ADT-free survival (figure) was 13 months (80% CI: 12-17) for the surveillance group and 21 months (80% CI: 14-29) for the MDT group (hazard ratio 0.60 [80% CI: 0.40 - 0.90], log-rank p=0.11). On subgroup analysis, no significant interaction was observed between the effect of MDT and PSA doubling time or location of metastases (p-value of interaction: 0.35 and 0.31 respectively). The PSA change is depicted as a waterfall plot as the largest change in PSA. In total, 74% of patients treated with MDT had a PSA decline as compared to 42% in the surveillance arm. The median time until PSA progression for the ITT was 6 months (95%CI: 3.85 - 8.15) for the surveillance group as compared to 10 months (5.46 - 14.55) for the MDT group (HR = 0.53, 95%CI: 0.30- 0.94, p = 0.03). Quality of life was similar between arms at baseline and remained comparable at 3 months and 1 year follow-up. Six patients developed grade 1 toxicity in the MDT arm.

SIP-T functions by stimulating cancer-specific dendritic cells and prolongs survival. IPI showed a borderline survival advantage in a large randomized trial. Thus, there may be potential synergy with SIP-T and IPI (SIPIPI) in combination. Method(s): Between April 2013 and April 2014, 9 docetaxel-naive men with MP-CRPC were treated prospectively with SIP-T followed immediately by low-dose IPI 1 mg/kg given for a total of 1 to 3 doses every three weeks. As has been previously published (Immuno Targets and Therapy, March 2017), cancer-specific immunoglobulins (IGS) directed at PA2024 and PAP showed a statistically-significant increase after SIP-T and a further statistically-significant increase, above the level achieved with SIP-T, after IPI. Three patients died from progressive disease after 9, 18, and 20 months. This abstract updates the outcome and survival of the remaining 6 patients. Result(s): Adverse events from SIPIPI were negligible. For the 9 men, the median age, Gleason score, and number of previous hormonal interventions were 77 years, 8, and 3, respectively. Median baseline PSA and Gleason score were 1.7 and 8, respectively. Eight men had bone metastases and 1 had lymph node metastasis. For the 6 surviving men, median follow-up since SIPIPI is 50.5 months (40-53). Their median PSA as of September 2017 is 5.5 (range: 0.27-18.10). Further treatment since SIPIPI includes abiraterone (4) enzalutamide (5) radium-223 (3) docetaxel (2) cabazitaxel (1) carboplatin (1) pembrolizumab (2) and Olaparib (1). One patient continues with a stable PSA of 0.27 without any further treatment post SIPIPI except SBRT. Conclusion(s): In this small trial of SIPIPI performed in men with docetaxel-naive MP-CRPC, median survival has now surpassed 4 years and the 6 surviving men still maintain a relatively low median PSA of 5.5.

PET/CT now offers improved sensitivity and accuracy in staging. Recent randomized trial data supports escalated hormone therapy, local primary tumor therapy, and metastasis-directed therapy. The impact of combining such therapies into a multimodal approach is unknown. This Phase II single-arm clinical trial sponsored and funded by Veterans Affairs combines local, metastasis-directed, and systemic therapies to durably render patients free of detectable disease off active therapy. Method(s): Patients with newly-diagnosed M1a/b prostate cancer (PSMA PET/CT staging is permitted) and 1-5 radiographically visible metastases (excluding pelvic lymph nodes) are undergoing local treatment with radical prostatectomy, limited duration systemic therapy for a total of six months (leuprolide, abiraterone acetate with prednisone, and apalutamide), metastasis-directed stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), and post-operative fractionated radiotherapy if pT >= 3a, N1, or positive margins are present. The primary endpoint is the percent of patients achieving a serum PSA of < 0.05 ng/mL six months after recovery of serum testosterone >=150 ng/dL. Secondary endpoints include time to biochemical progression, time to radiographic progression, time to initiation of alternative antineoplastic therapy, prostate cancer specific survival, health related quality-of-life, safety and tolerability.

Therefore, we sought to evaluate clinical effects of combinatorial AR-targeted therapy, including indomethacin (Indo) to inhibit the steroidogenic enzyme AKR1C3, in men with high risk PC undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP). Method(s): This was an open label, single-site, Phase II neoadjuvant trial in men with localized high to very-high risk PC, as defined by NCCN criteria. Patients received 12 weeks of neoadjuvant apalutamide (Apa), abiraterone (Abi) plus prednisone, degarelix, and Indo at their respective FDA-approved doses followed by RP. The primary objective was to determine the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate. Secondary objectives included assessing for minimal residual disease (MRD) (i.e. <=0.25 Cm3 tumor volume corrected for cellularity), measuring intraprostatic androgens and assessing molecular features associated with drug resistance. Twenty evaluable patients provided 91% power (one- sided alpha = 7.5%) to detect a difference in pCR rate of 5% (H0) vs. 25% (H1). Result(s): Twenty-two patients enrolled and 20 were evaluable for the primary endpoint (1 patient came off to pursue stereotactic radiosurgery; 1 was removed after developing grade 2 transaminitis). At baseline, the median PSA was 10.1 ng/mL (4.4-159.4), 4 (20%) patients had Gleason grade group (GG) 4 disease and 16 had GG 5 disease. At RP, 1 (5%) patient had a pCR, 6 (30%) had MRD, 18 (90%) had ypT3 disease and 7 (35%) had lymph node (LN) metastases. Treatment was generally well tolerated and adverse events were consistent with each individual drug's known safety profile. Additional follow up data and correlative work will be presented at the meeting. Conclusion(s): In our cohort of men with high-risk PC, pCR rates remained low even with combinatorial AR-directed therapy. Ongoing pharmacodynamic studies aimed at determining if Indo effectively inhibited AKR1C3 will provide important insights regarding the utility of targeting this steroidogenic enzyme.",exclusion,Other study,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2019.37.15_suppl.5081,,,

Altough serial PSA measurements are required to monitor response and progression, the role of serial imaging studies is unclear in daily routine. It was the purpose of our study to evaluate the potential additional benefit of imaging to monitor the disease. METHOD(S): A total of 56 patients with mCRPC underwent systemic first line treatment with ENZ or AA/P after failing primary LHRH-therapy. Mean serum testosterone was 34.4 (18 - 48) ng/dl. Patients underwent analysis of the serum markers PSA, alk. Phosphatase, CRP, hemoglobine, and LDH at 3-months intervals. In addition imaging studies were repeated at 3-months intervals or in case of PSA or symptomatic progression. RESULT(S): Mean duration of AA/P treatment is 12.7 (2-19) months and mean duration of ENZ therapy is 17.2 (3- 29) months. A PSA-response was achieved in 76% and 81% in the AA/P and the ENZ group, respectively. Beside PSA, responding patients in the AA/P group demonstrated a significant decrease in serum concentrations of LDH (367,96 225,4U/l) and alk. Phosphatase (249,59 117U/l) whereas responding pts in the ENZ group demonstrated a decrease in LDH only (339,5 228,33U/l). Median duration of PSA response is 10.8 and 11.5 months in the AA/P and the ENZ group, respectively. Despite stable serum levels of 0.6 (0.2-0.9) ng/ml and an asymptomatic status, 8 patients exhibited a significant radiographic progression in number and size of lymph node metastases (n=5) or skeletal metastases (n=3). 4 pts underwent local therapy of the progressing site by stereotactic radiation and in 4 pts treatment was switched to docetaxel. CONCLUSION(S): Despite considerable and stable PSAresponse 15% of our patients exhibited significant metastatic progression which would not have been detected without serial imaging studies. Therefore, we strongly advocate imaging studies even in the presence of stable PSA serum levels.",exclusion,Wrong intervention,,,,,

The fractionation sensitivity of PCa relative to surrounding tissues suggests that larger daily doses may improve the therapeutic ratio. To test this, a phase II study of SBRT with real-time motion management and daily plan re-optimization was undertaken. This is the first report of the toxicity and quality of life (QOL). Materials/Methods: From 2009-2013, 60 patients from 3 institutions were enrolled. Eligibility criteria included: T1-T2c with a Gleason score (GS) of 6 and PSA <= 15 or GS of 7 and PSA <= 10. Patients with nodal metastases, an International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) score > 18, or gland size > 100 g were not eligible. Patients were treated with SBRT to the prostate to 37 Gy/5 fractions over 10-14 days. A real-time tracking system or a stereotactic x-ray was required for target motion management. The PTV included the prostate with a 3 mm margin posteriorly and 5 mm margin in all other directions. Following treatment genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was graded based on CTCAE 4.0 and categorized as early (<= 90 days) or late (>90 days). Quality of life was assessed by the IPSS and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) prior to, during treatment and 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months after treatment. QOL was also scored by the Expanded Prostate cancer Index Composite Short Form (EPIC-26), a questionnaire regarding urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal symptoms, at 3, 12, 24, and 36 months post-treatment. (Table Presented) Results: The median age was 66. The median PSA was 5.83 and 40% of patients had a GS of 6. Seventy-eight percent of patients had T1c disease while 18% and 3% had T2a and T2b disease, respectively. The median follow-up was 27.6 months. Rates of GI and GU toxicity are shown below. The median AUA score increased to 12.1 during treatment from 6.7 at baseline (P<0.05) but was otherwise not significantly changed during follow-up.

A phase II study of stereotactic body radiotherapy with real-time motion management and daily plan re-optimization for low to intermediate risk prostate cancer was undertaken to evaluate this hypothesis. This report details the toxicity and quality of life following treatment. METHODS: From 2009 to 2013, 60 patients with T1-T2c prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 6 and PSA ≤ 15 or Gleason score of 7 and PSA ≤ 10 were enrolled. Patients with nodal metastases, an American Urological Association symptom score > 18, or gland size > 100 g were not eligible. Patients were treated to 37 Gy in 5 fractions. Early and late genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity were graded based on NCI CTCAE v4.0 and quality of life was assessed by the American Urological Association symptom score, International Index of Erectile Function, and Expanded Prostate cancer Index Composite Short Form up to 36 months after treatment. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 27.6 months, no grade 3 or greater genitourinary toxicity was observed. Four patients (6.7%) reported a late grade 2 genitourinary toxicity. One patient (1.7%) reported a late grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity. Five patients (8.3%) developed a late grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity. The median American Urological Association symptom score increased from 4.5 prior to treatment to 11 while on treatment (p < 0.01), but was 5 at 36 months post-treatment (p = 0.65). Median International Index of Erectile Function scores decreased from 19 to 17 over the course of follow-up (p < 0.01). Only median scores within the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Short Form sexual domain were significantly decreased at 36 months post-treatment (67.9 vs 45.2, p = 0.02). There was no significant difference in median score within the urinary, bowel, or hormonal domains at 36 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic body radiotherapy for low to intermediate risk prostate cancer is well tolerated with limited toxicity or decrease in quality of life.

METHODS: Using nationwide Medicare claims from 2011 to 2014, we identified radiation episodes for bone metastasis from prostate, lung, and breast cancer. Details regarding fractionation, radiation therapy (RT) modality, and sociodemographic characteristics were abstracted from claims. Time trends in use of 10 or fewer RT fractions per episode were evaluated using the Cochran-Armitage test. Total cost per episode was calculated from a payer's perspective and reported in 2017 dollars; time trends in cost were assessed using linear regression. Generalized linear models identified predictors of treatment with 10 or fewer fractions. RESULTS: Of 51,533 episodes identified, 46,326 used 2D/3D RT, 3,199 used intensity-modulated RT, and 2,008 used stereotactic body RT. The proportion of 2D/3D RT episodes using 10 or fewer fractions increased from 65.5% to 79.7% ( P(trend) < .001), and mean total cost per episode decreased from $6,742 to $6,067 ( P(trend) < .001). Use of single-fraction radiation increased modestly for 2D/3D treatment (6.5% to 8.1%; P(trend) < .001). Predictors of 10 or fewer fractions included treatment in recent years, advanced age (≥ 85 years), and higher comorbidity score. Variation was noted based on geographic region and primary cancer. CONCLUSION: During a period with quality initiatives launched by the American Society for Radiation Oncology, American Board of Internal Medicine, and National Quality Forum, use of 10 or fewer fractions for bone metastasis increased by 14.2%, but single-fraction regimens increased by only 1.6%, highlighting opportunities for quality improvement.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.1200/JOP.18.00588,,,

The objectives of the Novel Integration of New prostate radiation schedules with adJuvant Androgen deprivation (NINJA) clinical trial are to compare two emerging SBRT regimens for efficacy with technical substudies focussing on MRI only planning and the use of knowledge-based planning (KBP) to assess radiotherapy plan quality. Methods and analysis Eligible patients must have biopsy-proven unfavourable intermediate or favourable high-risk PC, have an Eastern Collaborative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1 and provide written informed consent. All patients will receive 6 months in total of androgen deprivation therapy. Patients will be randomised to one of two SBRT regimens. The first will be 40 Gy in five fractions given on alternating days (SBRT monotherapy). The second will be 20 Gy in two fractions given 1 week apart followed 2 weeks later by 36 Gy in 12 fractions given five times per week (virtual high-dose rate boost (HDRB)). The primary efficacy outcome will be biochemical clinical control at 5 years. Secondary endpoints for the initial portion of NINJA look at the transition of centres towards MRI only planning and the impact of KBP on real-time (RT) plan assessment. The first 150 men will demonstrate accrual feasibility as well as addressing the KBP and MRI planning aims, prior to proceeding with total accrual to 472 patients as a phase III randomised controlled trial. Ethics and dissemination NINJA is a multicentre cooperative clinical trial comparing two SBRT regimens for men with PC. It builds on promising results from several single-armed studies, and explores radiation dose escalation in the Virtual HDRB arm. The initial component includes novel technical elements, and will form an important platform set for a definitive phase III study.

METHODS: Patients who were treated with SBRT to nonspine bone metastases were identified by retrospective chart review. An independent musculoskeletal radiologist evaluated response to treatment using computed tomography (CT) scans. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were treated to 42 nonspine bone metastases. The most common primary cancer cites were renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (33.3%), lung (24.2%), and prostate (18.2%). Bone metastases were either mainly lytic (57.1%), mainly sclerotic (28.6%), or mixed (14.3%). When lytic and sclerotic lesions were evaluated according to RECIST 1.1, local control (LC) was 83%, 85%, 88%, and 80% for those with CT imaging between months 1 to 3, 4 to 6, 7 to 9, and 10 to 12, respectively. When evaluated by the MDA criteria by density, LC within each time period was slightly greater. Overall LC decreased considerably when evaluated by MDA in terms of size. CONCLUSIONS: Consensus definitions of response are required as they have implications on clinical trials and disease management. Without consistent response criteria, outcomes from clinical trials cannot be compared and treatment efficacy remains undetermined.",exclusion,No comparator,,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2015.07.2288,,,

Patients and Methods: From 2012 to 2017, 154 patients (92 with unfavourable intermediate-risk or high-risk PCa) were treated with helical TomoTherapy delivering 43.8-45.2 Gy in eight fractions over 3 weeks. Of these, 73% received hormonotherapy (51% neoadjuvant). Result(s): The median (range) follow-up was 48 (19-84) months. For the whole series, crude BDFS and 5-year BDFS rates were 97.4% and 94.3%, respectively. The corresponding figures for unfavourable intermediate-risk and high-risk PCa were 96.7% and 90%, respectively. The crude metastasis-free survival rate was 98% for the unfavourable intermediate-risk and high-risk group. For the whole series, the 5-year cumulative urinary/intestinal grade 2+ late toxicity was 17.8/7.4%. No grade 4-5 toxicity was observed. One patient experienced late grade 3 toxicity (urinary). Conclusion(s): This eight-fraction UHRT regimen can be safely delivered to patients with unfavourable intermediate-risk/high-risk PCa. Its relapse rates are similar to those reported for the combination of external beam radiotherapy plus brachytherapy, however, the observed toxicity profile is milder. The disease survival rates compare favourably with historical controls in some other forms of radiotherapy, with similar side effects.

Usually, prostate SBRT has been delivered every other day in order to favor normal tissue recovery, thus minimizing side-effects. Flattening filter free (FFF) delivery is a treatment modality able to reduce treatment beam-on time, decreasing patient positioning uncertainties. We reported feasibility, side effects and biochemical control of FFF SBRT delivered in 5 consecutive days in a cohort of patients affected by localized PC. Patients and Methods: The study, approved by the Ethical Committee, started on January 2014. Inclusion criteria were: age <=80 years, World Health Organization performance status <=2, histologically-proven prostate adenocarcinoma, low-to-intermediate risk according to D'Amico criteria, no distant metastases, no previous surgery other than TURP, no other malignant tumor in the previous 5 years, a pre-SBRT International Prostatic Symptoms Score (IPSS) ranged between 0 and 7. The SBRTschedules were: 35 Gy for low risk and 37.5 Gy for intermediate risk PC in 5 fractions, delivered in 5 consecutive days. SBRT was delivered with volumetric modulated radiation therapy (VMAT). Toxicity assessment was performed according to CTCAE v4.0 scale. Neoadjuvant/ concomitant hormonal-therapy was prescribed according to risk classification. Result(s): Fifty-two patients were enrolled at the time of analysis. Median age was 73 years (55-83), Median follow-up was 33 months (range=6-55 months). Thirty-four (65.3%) had a low-risk PC and 18 (34.6%) an intermediate-risk PC. Median initial PSA was 5.9 ng/ml (range=1.8-15.7 ng/ml). Median Gleason score was 6 (6-7). Median IPSS pre-SBRT was 4.5 (range=0-7). All patients completed the treatment as planned. Acute G1-2 toxicity occurred in 18 (34.6%) patients and was distributed as follows: 8 (15.3%) cases of G1 gastrointestinal toxicity, 1 (1.9%) patients had G2 gastrointestinal toxicity, 5 (9.6%) patients reported G2 genitourinary toxicity and 11 (21.1%) G1 genitourinary toxicity. Patients may have experienced more than one toxicity. Late G1 gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in 5 (9.6%) patients. No G3 toxicities occurred. At the last follow-up median IPSS was 3 (1-19) and median PSA was 0.315 ng/ml (range=0.04-7.965 ng/ml). Biochemical control was 98%. Conclusion(s): The results of our study showed that FFF SBRT in 5 fractions for low-to-intermediate PC is feasible and well tolerated.

Materials/Methods: From 08/2012 through 12/2015, 170 patients (pts) from 9 institutions with cT1c-3aN0M0 PCa and a risk of nodal involvement <=20% were randomized according to two different o schedules: either 9 days (arm A, 84 pts), or 28 days, once-a-week, the same week-day (arm B, 86 pts).The prescribed dose was 36.25 Gy (7.25 Gy x 5) in both arms, with a urethra sparing of 32.5 Gy (6.5 Gy x 5). SBRT was delivered with VMAT or IMRT using Novalis linacs and the ExacTrac IGRT technology. Genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (CTCAE v4.03 grading scale), IPSS, and QoL scores (EORTC QLQ-PR25) were assessed at baseline, at the 5th fraction (5 fx), 12th weeks (W12) and every 6 months since SBRT. Result(s): 82 and 83 pts, respectively, from arms A and B, were retained for this analysis (5 out of 170 randomized pts were never treated). A toxicity stopping rule was activated during the first 3-months of pts' FU though was never triggered. Grade-2 GU toxicity rates at baseline, 5 fx, and W12 were 2%, 17%, and 11% vs. 5%, 19% and 6% for pts in arms A and B, respectively (mainly moderate irritative and voiding symptoms). Only one case of obstructive grade-3 GU toxicity was observed at W12 in arm B. Two cases of grade-2 GI toxicity (2.5%) were observed at 5 fx in arm A. Grade-2 GU toxicity decreased up to a 4 % rate in both arms at the last FU. One case of grade-3 GU toxicity was observed in arm A. The incidence of grade-2 GI toxicity was below 3 % in both arms. Concerning IPSS, the rate of pts satisfied at baseline and 18-months were 80 % and 90 % for arm A and 77 and 88 % for arm B, respectively. No changes in EORTC QLQ-PR25 scores were observed in both arms during the first 18 months. Median PSA decreased from 8.3 and 7 ng/ ml at baseline to 0.53 and 0.46 ng/ml at month 18 for arms A and B, respectively.

In these patients (pts) the use of aggressive local treatment, as radiotherapy, may be potentially justified rather than a systemic approach. We report clinical experience of a small group of pts with Ol-PCa recurrence and treated with SBRTon positive lesions at 18Fcholine PET/CT (18F-CH). Matherials and Methods: From 2011 to September 2015, 18 pts with Ol-PCa recurrence at 18F-CH, were treated with SBRT on PET-positive lesions (mean age: 69 years; range: 56-81). All pts underwent radical prostatectomy at time of first diagnosis and 11 of them also received adjuvant/salvage radiotherapy (RT). At staging, we found 3 high-risk PCa, 9 very high-risk PCa, and 1 intermediate-risk PCa; Gleason Score (GS) was less than 7 in 1 pts, equal to 7 in 8 pts, and exceeding 7 in 9 pts. Median time to clinical relapse after primary treatment (surgery +/- RT) was 26.2 months (range: 3-141). Nine pts received one or more lines of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) before RT. Mean and median PSA before SBRT was 3.01 ng/ml and 1.9 ng/mL (range: 0.69-14.9), respectively. SBRT was delivered on 18F-CH positive nodal recurrence (N-MTS) in 16 pts, and in 2 pts with positive bone metastases (B-MTS); it was delivered in association with ADT in 6 pts, while the treatment was exclusive in the other 13 pts. We analyzed outcomes in terms of local control (LC), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): All pts were alive at a mean and median follow-up (15.5 and 18.3 months, respectively) (range: 2,5-58). Fourteen pts were treated with SBRT to 1 site (abdominal node: 12 pts; bone lesion: 2 pts), while 4 pts were treated to 2 different sites (all nodal). One-Year OS was 100% while mean and median PFS were respectively 19.7 and 13.1 (CI95% 5.3-21) months. One-year PFS were 52.7%, while LC was 100%. In terms of PFS, we have not found significant statistical prognostic factors: only adiuvant ADT and no concomitant treatments (SBRT exclusive) seemed to have a positive impact on PFS with a 1-year PFS of 60.0% for hormone-naive pts. Conclusion(s): In pts with Ol-PCa recurrence, 18F-CH has proved to be useful in plannig SBRT, a non invasive loco-regional approach, with the aim of reducing side effects of more invasive treatments.",exclusion,No comparator,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00259-016-3484-4,,,

However, (68) Ga-PSMA-PET may also have diagnostic utility in the setting of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We investigate the differential role of (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and PSMA-PET/CT scanning in patients with oligometastatic RCC. In particular, we focus on the utility of PSMA-PET for diagnostic evaluation of isolated or limited metastases planned for local surgery or radiation, as well as the potential utility of PSMA-PET for therapeutic response assessment in patients receiving stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR). METHODS: We present a retrospective series of eight patients in which comparative imaging modalities are evaluated against PSMA-PET scanning. FDG-PET and PSMA-PET scans were performed prior to definitive treatment (either surgery or SABR) of limited recurrent disease. Response assessment after SABR was performed with both PET imaging modalities at multiple time points in a subset of four patients. RESULTS: Prostate specific membrane antigen uptake is typically more intense than FDG in RCC. In all but two cases, one of which was papillary carcinoma, FDG-PET and PSMA-PET are concordant for detection of sites of disease. We demonstrate for the first time the differential kinetics of post-treatment response using PSMA and FDG-PET, with a more rapid metabolic response observed on FDG-PET. Both modalities demonstrate response earlier than morphological appearances on CT or MRI imaging. CONCLUSIONS: Our series suggests that PSMA shows early promise as a diagnostic and therapeutic response assessment tool in patients with metastatic RCC receiving definitive local therapies.",exclusion,"other study, no comparator",,10.1111/1754-9485.12590,,,

METHODS: This is a retrospective review of 22 patients treated with SABR for skeletal metastases for oligometastases (OM) or oligoprogression (OP) since October 2012. There are a total of 27 treatments with 20 spinal and seven non-spinal metastases. Treatment outcome including local control (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), pain control, treatment-related toxicity and failure pattern are described. Patients are assessed by interval computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography-CT, magnetic resonance imaging or bone scintigraphy by physicians' discretion. Toxicities are graded by common toxicities criteria version 4.03. RESULT: The median age of the patients is 64 years. Primary sites include lung (50%), breast (32%), nasopharynx (9%), prostate (4.5%) and colon (4.5%). Twelve patients with OM and 10 with OP are included. Dose to most spinal and non-spinal metastases is 35 and 50 Gy, respectively, in five fractions. With a median follow up of 15.6 months, there are three local failures (1-year LC 91.2%). The median PFS and OS are 10.1 and 37.3 months, while PFS of OP and OM group is 6.6 and 10.6 months, respectively. Two-third of symptomatic patients have at least 1-year complete pain control. There are two vertebral fractures and one grade 3 esophagitis. CONCLUSION: Our series shows excellent LC of SABR to skeletal metastases with limited toxicities in OM and OP diseases.

random-journal.pdf,ProM250,,2017,English,pro.m:#5;pro.p:#5,What are the best ingredients to deliver the optimal radiotherapy for prostate cancer,"Optimisation for prostate radiotherapy involves understanding the natural history of prostate cancer, its prognosticators, the underlying radiobiology and strategies for radiotherapy treatment as well as how best to deliver the therapy regimes devised. Prostate cancer presents with a large spectrum of risk factors that drives its natural history as such the presenting prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, the summed Gleason score and the local tumour nodal and metastasis (TNM) staging. Taken together this combination of prognostic factors still provides the most reliable disease stratification compared to new tests or potential biomarkers that still require validation. It is well recognised that more reliable and sensitive predictive and prognostic factors are needed to distinguish risk groups within each risk stratification due to the large heterogeneity that exists within them. Using this approximately set of factors, prostate cancer can be divided into low, intermediate and high to very high risk groups for localised to regional disease that may receive radiotherapy curatively. This further guides the treatment volumes needed to achieve the best curative rate as well as the treatment strategies ie external beam photon therapy alone or in combination with high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy or HDR monotherapy or proton therapy In addition, over the past one to two decades, the understanding of prostate radiobiology has changed from accepting the standard alpha-beta ratio of 10 assigned for the majority of cancer diseases to a much lower alphabeta ratio much more akin to that of late reacting tissues. This lower alpha-beta ratio of around 1.2 to 2.5 has driven the radiotherapy rationale for using larger dose per fraction or hypofractionation. Earlier trials have suggested that this may provide a therapeutic benefit. Recently in the past year, 2 very large randomised trials have provided outcome equivalence for the use of moderate hypofractionation compared to conventional fractionation. The first randomised trial of over 800 cases from USA in early stage disease compared 2.75Gy to 1.8Gy dose fractions in a non-inferiority study can reported equivalence for the schedules. The second non-inferiority UK/International trial recruited nearly 3300 cases and reported equivalence of 3Gy to 2Gy dose fractions for early to intermediate stage prostate cancer. These outcomes have now established a new standard for the radiotherapeutic management of early to intermediate stage localised prostate cancer. These results should not be confused with the Dutch study looking for superiority of 3.3Gy over 2Gy dose fractions where the primary endpoint was not achieved. It remains to be determined if larger dose fractions (>= 5Gy) delivered over 1 week such as that used in stereotactic radiotherapy may provide further benefit. Trials are currently on going and their results are eagerly awaited. As important as the dose fractionation are the therapy regimes and the potentially combinations listed above. It is recognised that local failure often occurs at the site of dominant clonagenic numbers thus the utilisation of simultaneous integrated boosts with hypofractionation has potential. This is being assessed in several studies such as the FLAME study where toxicity was demonstrated to be similar to standard and conventional regimes. Important questions that need to be addressed include identification of appropriate treatment volumes and potential regions of dose escalation or even dose de-escalation. Just as important will be methods of ensure that these shorter treatment regimes are delivered both accurately and reliably. These aspects will be reviewed by the co-lecturers within this symposium.",exclusion,review,,,,,

Patients with this disease profile who could benefit from treatment with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) were selected and their responses to these techniques were rated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, controlled, unicentric study, involving 46 consecutive patients from our centre who presented biochemical relapse after adjuvant, salvage or radical treatment with external beam radiotherapy, or brachytherapy. After initial tests (bone scintigraphy, CT, pelvic MRI), 35 patients with oligometastases or without them were selected. 11 patients with multiple metastases were excluded from the study. WB-DW-MRI and choline-PET/CT was then performed on each patient within 1 week. The results were interpreted by specialists in nuclear medicine and MRI. If they were candidates for treatment with ablative SBRT (SABR), they were then evaluated every three months with both tests. RESULTS: Choline-PET/CT detected lesions in 16 patients that were not observable using WB-DW-MRI. The results were consistent in seven patients and in three cases, a lesion was observed using WB-DW-MRI that was not detected with choline-PET/CT. The Kappa value obtained was 0.133 (p = 0.089); the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of WB-DW-MRI were estimated at 44.93, 64.29, 86.11, and 19.15%, respectively. For choline-PET/CT patients, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 97.10, 58.33, 93.06, and 77.78%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Choline-PET/CT has a high global sensitivity while WB-DW-MRI has a high specificity, and so they are complementary techniques. Future studies with more enrolled patients and a longer follow-up period will be required to confirm these data. The initial data show that the best technique for evaluating response after SBRT is choline-PET/CT.

Efficacy and impact on treatment strategy.,"PURPOSE: The primary aim of this retrospective, single-centre analysis was to assess the performance of (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in prostate cancer (PCa) patients in early PSA failure after radical prostatectomy (RP). The secondary aim was to assess the potential impact of (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT on treatment strategy. METHODS: (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT is performed in our institution within an investigational new drug (IND) trial in PCa patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR). The records of all patients enrolled between March 2016 and July 2017 were evaluated. These records were retrospectively analysed according to the following inclusion criteria: (a) RP as primary therapy, (b) proven BCR, ©) PSA levels in the range 0.2-0.5 ng/ml at the time of the (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT investigation, and (d) no salvage radiotherapy (S-RT) performed after recurrence. The performance of (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT was evaluated in terms of detection rate on a per-patient and a per-region basis (local vs. distant lesions). We further performed an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The patient cohort was grouped into three subpopulations, blinded to the (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT results, according to the patients' characteristics and different patterns of treatment: (1) S-RT (with or without systemic treatment), (2) stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) (with or without systemic treatment), and (3) systemic treatment. The treatment strategy was re-evaluated for each patient taking into consideration the (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT images. RESULTS: We enrolled 119 PCa patients (mean age 66 years, range 44-78 years) with a mean PSA level at the time of (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT of 0.34 ng/ml (median 0.32 ng/ml, SD ±0.09, range 0.20-0.50 ng/ml). (68)Ga-PSMA-1 1 PET/CT was positive in 41 of the 119 patients, resulting in an overall detection rate of 34.4%. (68)Ga-PSMA-11 uptake was observed in the prostate bed (3 patients, 2.5%), in the pelvic lymph nodes (21, 17.6%), in the retroperitoneal lymph nodes (4, 3.4%) and in the skeleton (21, 17.6%). Regarding ITT, 81 patients (68.1%) were considered possible candidates for S-RT only in the prostate bed and none of the patients (0%) for SBRT. According to the (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT results, the intended treatment was changed in 36 patients (30.2%). According to the PET/CT results, S-RT was recommended in 70 patients (58.8%), only to the prostate bed in 58 (48.7%) and SBRT in 29 (24.4%). The intended RT planning was modified in 36 (87.8%) of 41 patients with a positive (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT result. CONCLUSION: In our patient series with PSA levels <0.5 ng/ml, (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT had a detection rate of 34.4%. In the ITT analysis, 30.2% of patients had a change in the intended treatment. These data support the hypothesis that (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT is a useful procedure in the management of PCa patients showing early recurrence after RP, and should be implemented in routine clinical practice.",exclusion,Other study design,,,10.1007/s00259-018-4066-4,,,

Patients with oligometastatic disease could eventually be managed by treating all the active lesions with local therapy, i.e. either surgery or ablative stereotactic body radiotherapy. This study aims to assess the impact of [(18)F]Choline ([(18)F]FMCH) PET/CT and the use stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in patients (pts) with oligometastatic prostate cancer (PCa). METHODS: Twenty-nine pts with oligometastatic PCa (≤3 synchronous active lesions detected with [(18)F]FMCHPET/CT) were treated with repeated salvage SBRT until disease progression (development of > three active synchronous metastases). Primary endpoint was systemic therapy-free survival measured from the baseline [(18)F]FMCHPET/CT. RESULTS: A total of 45 lesions were treated with SBRT. After a median follow-up of 11.5 months (range 3-40 months), 20 pts were still in the study and did not receive any systemic therapy. Nine pts started systemic therapy, and the median time of the primary endpoint was 39.7 months (CI 12.20-62.14 months). No grade 3 or 4 toxicity was recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated salvage [(18)F]FMCHPET/CT-guided SBRT is well tolerated and could defer the beginning of systemic therapy in selected patients with oligometastatic PCa.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,PM1,10.1186/s13014-016-0586-x,,,

Radiotherapy is a widely used form of therapy that is used in half of all cancer patients. Advances in understanding the fundamentals of tumor and radiation biology, in medical physics and computer science as well as technical developments have continuously improved the effectiveness and healing success of radiotherapy. Patients benefit from new treatment concepts such as hypofractionated radiotherapy for breast and prostate cancer, leading to a reduction in the duration of treatment by several weeks. Selected patients with early stages of breast cancer can be treated with partial breast irradiation with focus on the tumor bed after breast conserving surgery increasing tolerability and comfort. High dose stereotactic radiotherapy over five to six sessions of radiation or only one fraction (radiosurgery) have expanded treatment options for common tumor entities leading to long-lasting tumor control resulting in improved survival and quality of life for those affected. In early lung cancer stereotactic radiotherapy is an alternative to primary tumor surgery. For patients with oligometastatic tumor disease stereotactic radiotherapy allows a curative approach by effectively treating metastases. In patients with brain metastases whole-brain irradiation is replaced by stereotactic irradiation of the individual metastases with fewer side effects. Recently, promising results for improved tumor control with the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy have been presented. Radioimmunotherapy represents a new therapy combination. However, final assessment of its efficacy and side effects profile is still missing. In order to gain therapeutic certainty, further prospective study data are necessary.",exclusion,review,Llegir per a informació general sobre RT,PM2,10.1024/0040-5930/a001086,,,

Radiation therapy is one of the reference analgesic treatments. The objective of this study was to compare the current practices of a French radiotherapy department for the treatment of uncomplicated bone metastases with data from the literature in order to improve and optimize the management of patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective monocentric study of patients who underwent palliative irradiation of uncomplicated bone metastases was performed. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients had 116 treatments of uncomplicated bone metastases between January 2014 and December 2015, including 44 men (48%) and 47 women (52%) with an average age of 63years (25-88years). Primary tumours most commonly found were breast cancer (35%), lung cancer (16%) and prostate cancer (12%). The regimens used were in 29% of cases 30Gy in ten fractions (group 30Gy), in 21% of cases 20Gy in five fractions (group 20Gy), in 22% of cases 8Gy in one fraction (group 8Gy) and in 28% of cases 23.31Gy in three fractions of stereotactic body irradiation (stereotactic group). The general condition of the patient (P<0.001), pain score and analgesic (P<0.001), oligometastatic profile (P=0.003) and practitioner experience (P<0.001) were factors influencing the choice of the regimen irradiation. Age (P=0.46), sex (P=0.14), anticancer treatments (P=0.56), concomitant hospitalization (P=0.14) and the distance between the radiotherapy centre and home (P=0.87) did not influence the decision significantly. A total of three cases of spinal compression and one case of post-therapeutic fracture were observed, occurring between one and 128days and 577days after irradiation, respectively. Eight percent of all irradiated metastases were reirradiated with a delay ranging between 13 and 434days after the first irradiation. The re-irradiation rate was significantly higher after 8Gy (P=0.02). The rate of death was significantly lower in the stereotactic arm (P<0.001) and overall survival was significantly greater in the stereotactic arm (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: This study showed that patients' analysed was comparable to the population of different studies. Predictive factors for the choice of the treatment regimen were identified. Non-fractionnated therapy was underutilised while stereotactic treatment was increasingly prescribed, showing an evolution in the management of patients.",exclusion,Not dealing with the intervention of interest (dealing with bone metastasis),,PM3,10.1016/j.canrad.2017.09.006,,,

METHODS: Forty patients with localized prostate adenocarcinoma received SBRT for 5 doses totaling 36.25 Gy (n = 20) or IMRT for 42 doses totaling 75.6 Gy (n = 20). We compared the post-therapeutic PSA levels and related toxic reactions between the two groups of patients and recorded the rates of 5-year overall survival and freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF). RESULTS: The minimum level of PSA was 0.41 (0－1.25) μg/L at 2 years and 0.22 (0.1－1.4) μg/L at 3 years after radiotherapy in the SBRT group, significantly lower than 0.62 (0－2.4) μg/L and 0.47 (0－2.5) μg/L in the IMRT group (P < 0.05), while the time to the minimum PSA level was markedly shorter in the IMRT than in the SBRT group (27.9 ［1.0－40.8］ vs 33.6 ［2.7－41.6］ mo, P < 0.05). The change rate of the PSA level was remarkably higher in the SBRT than in the IMRT group at 2 and 3 years after treatment (－0.06 and －0.05 μg/L/mo vs －0.04 and －0.02 μg/L/mo, P < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed in the 5-year overall survival between the SBRT and IMRT groups (91.1% vs 86.7%, P = 0.158).

PCa expresses antigens that could be recognized by the immune system. We therefore hypothesized that stereotactic dose escalation to the DIN is safe, may increase local control, and may initiate tumor-specific immune responses. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with localized PCa were treated with stereotactic extreme hypofractionated doses of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions to the whole prostate while simultaneously escalating doses to the magnetic resonance image-visible DIN (45 Gy, 47.5 Gy, and 50 Gy in 5 fractions). The phase 1a part was designed to determine the recommended phase 1b dose in a ""3 + 3"" cohort-based, dose-escalation design. The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicities defined as ≥grade 3 gastrointestinal (GI) or genitourinary (GU) toxicity (or both) by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4) up to 90 days after the first radiation fraction. The secondary endpoints were prostate-specific antigen kinetics, quality of life (QoL), and blood immunologic responses. RESULTS: Nine patients were treated in phase 1a. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed at either level, and therefore the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Further characterization of tolerability, efficacy, and immunologic outcomes was conducted in the subsequent 11 patients irradiated at the highest dose level (50 Gy) in the phase 1b expansion cohort. Toxicity was 45% and 25% for grades 1 and 2 GU, and 20% and 5% for grades 1 and 2 GI, respectively. No grade 3 or worse toxicity was reported. The average (±standard error of the mean) of the QoL assessments at baseline and at 3-month posttreatment were 0.8 (±0.8) and 3.5 (±1.5) for the bowel (mean difference, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-5), and 6.4 (±0.8) and 7.27 (±0.9) for the International Prostate Symptom Score (mean difference, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-1.9), respectively. A subset of patients developed antigen-specific immune responses against prostate-specific membrane antigen (n = 2), prostatic acid phosphatase (n = 1), prostate stem cell antigen (n = 4), and prostate-specific antigen (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: Irradiation of the whole prostate with 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions and dose escalation to 50 Gy to the DIN was tolerable and determined as the recommended phase 1b dose. This treatment has promising antitumor activity, which will be confirmed by the ongoing phase 2 part. Preliminary QoL analysis showed minimal impact in GU, GI, and sexual domains.

We hypothesized that higher radiation dose levels would be associated with improved tumor control outcomes. We report toxicity outcomes as well as PSA relapse-free survival and 2-Year biopsy results among patients treated on a prospective dose escalation study using high-dose 5-fraction stereotactic body radiosurgery (SBRT) for patients with low and intermediate risk prostate cancer. Purpose/Objective(s): One hundred thirty-six patients were accrued to a Phase I dose escalation study to determine the tolerance of escalating radiation dose levels of SBRT for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. Secondary objectives of this study were to determine tumor control outcomes with dose-escalation. The initial dose level was 32.5 Gy in 5 fractions delivered every other day. After 30 patients were accrued and at least 50% of these were followed for a minimum of 3 months, the dose level was escalated by 2.5 Gy increments. In this fashion 30 patients received a prescription dose of 32.5 Gy, 35 patients were treated to 35 Gy, 36 patients to 37.5 Gy and 35 patients to 40 Gy. Eligibility criteria included only low and intermediate risk patients, and patients treated with neo-adjuvant androgen deprivation were excluded. The median follow-up for the 4 dose levels were 66 months, 54 months, 36 months, and 30 months, respectively. Result(s): The incidence of acute grade 2 rectal toxicities for dose levels 1-4 were 0%, 5.7%, 3.2%, and 3.2%, respectively. No grade 3 or 4 acute rectal toxicities were observed. The incidence of acute grade 2 urinary toxicities for dose levels 1-4 were 13.3%, 8.6%, 13.9%, and 6.5%, respectively. Only 1 patient at the 40 Gy dose level experienced a grade 3 acute toxicity (urinary retention requiring Foley catheter placement). The incidence of late grade 2 rectal toxicities for dose levels 1-4 were 3.3%, 0%, 2.8%, and 0%, respectively. No grade 3 or 4 late rectal toxicities were observed. The incidence of late grade 2 urinary toxicities for dose levels 1-4 were 13.3%, 14.3%, 8.3%, and 9.7%, respectively. Only one late grade 3 urinary toxicity (urethral stricture) developed in the 32.5 Gy dose arm after treatment which was corrected with transurethral resection. No grade 4 late urinary toxicities were observed. The median PSA nadir value at 2 years for the dose groups were 0.7 ng/ml, 0.59 ng/ml, and 0.46 ng/ml and 0.48 ng/ml, respectively. The 3-year PSA relapse free survival outcomes for all 4 dose groups are: 83%, 85%, 90%, and 98% (P < 0.001). The incidence of a positive post-treatment biopsy was 45%, 12%, 17%, and 5%, respectively, for the 4 dose arms (P < 0.001).

Detection of cancer locations and impact on subsequent therapy,"Aim: A complete biochemical response immediately after radical prostatectomy (RP) is an indicator of optimal prostate cancer (PCa) control. However, patients with persistent high PSA levels after RP showed less favourable cancer control and survival rates over time. Thus, the precise localization of residual disease after RP is crucial for improving patients' outcome. The primary aim of this study was to assess the role of 68Ga- PSMA-11 PET/CT for detecting PCa location(s) in patients with biochemical persistence (BCP) after RP. Secondary aim was to evaluate its impact on adjuvant radiotherapy (ART) or salvage radiotherapy (SRT) planning. Method(s): 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT is performed in our institution through a prospective, single-center, open-label study approved by local ethical committee (prot. P-5315). Two hundred-eleven PCa patients were referred to our center from November 2016 to December 2018. We performed a retrospective sub-analysis in BCP patients matching these inclusion criteria: 1) RP as primary therapy; 2) PSA-nadir >0.1 ng/mL at 8 weeks after RP; 3) No adjuvant/salvage therapy or hormonal-therapy (ADT) performed after RP; 4) PET scan performed within 12 months from RP. Twenty-one patients matched these criteria and were considered in this analysis (median age 69.6 years; range 52-80). Patients presented with International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade <=3 (n=8/21) and >=4 (n=13/21), stage >=pT3a (n=11/21), pN1 (n=3/21) and R1 disease (n=9/21), respectively. Median/mean PSA-nadir were 0.2/0.5 +- 0.7 ng/mL (range 0.1-3.3); median/mean PSA doubling time were 3.1/4.7 +- 4.7 months (range 0.6-19.4); median/mean PSA velocity were 0.8/6.5 +- 11.8 ng/mL/year (range 0-30.2). Result(s): 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT detection rate was 52.3% (CI95% 32.4%-71.7%). Median/mean PSA at the time of PET scan were 0.5/1.3 +- 2.1 ng/mL (range 0.21- 8.9). Locally confined disease only (prostate bed) was detected in 4.7% of cases, pelvic nodes were detected in 14.3%, while at least one distant lesion (extra-pelvic nodes and/or bone lesions) was detected in 33.3%. ART/SRT in prostate bed was the intended treatment before PET scan in all cases. ART/SRT plan was reviewed in a tumor board integrating 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT results. ART/SRT planning was confirmed as intended before PET scan in 11/21 patients (10 PET negative and 1 PET positive with prostate bed relapse). 3/21 performed ART/SRT in prostate bed and additional stereotactic radiotherapy on PET positive findings. ART/SRT was aborted in 3/21 patients and ADT was administrated instead of ART/SRT. In 1/21 case ART/SRT was aborted and pelvic lymph-node dissection was performed. In 3/21 cases ART/SRT planned target volume was modified including only PET positive pelvic nodes withouth standard radiotherapy in prostate bed. Conclusion(s): In this patient-series, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT proved its role in BCP setting detecting disease outside prostate bed in 47.6% of cases. In these patients adjuvant/salvage therapy plan was modified due to the integration of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT results into the decision-making process. These data may suggest the presence of extended disease not detected by conventional imaging prior to surgery and highlight the importance of PET imaging in BCP setting.",exclusion,Other study design,,,,,,

We aim to compare the healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL) deterioration at 12 months in favorable-risk PCa patients treated with SABR, HDR monotherapy and HDR boost. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients treated as part of 7 prospective clinical trials were included in this analysis. All patients had low-or intermediaterisk PCa. Three dose escalation strategies were considered: 1)SABR [35-40 Gy/5 fractions], 2)HDR monotherapy [19 Gy/1 fraction or 27 Gy/2 fractions] and 3)HDR boost [Single 15 Gy HDR + external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) 37.5 Gy/15 fractions or 20 Gy/2 fractions HDR + EBRT 45 Gy/25 fractions]. HRQoL was prospectively measured at baseline and 12 months in all trials, using the Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC). A minimally important difference (MID) was defined as a deterioration of HRQoL scores at 12 months compared to baseline $ 0.5 standard deviation of baseline score. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression using generalized estimating equations were used to compare the proportion of patients having MID between treatment groups. To test the robustness of the results, a set of sensitivity analyses was conducted. Dynamic changes over time were compared using general linear mixed models after assuming individual patient and trial with random effect. A two-tailed p-value # 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): Six hundred and forty-eight patients were included; 288, 173 and 187 respectively in the SABR, HDR monotherapy and HDR boost group.

In the bowel domain, the odds of having bowel MID were 65% lower if patients were treated with HDR monotherapy (19% vs. 40%; OR: 0.354. 95% CI: 0.278-0.449, p<0.001) compared to HDR boost, however no significant difference was found between SABR and HDR boost (39% vs. 40%, p=0.85). These findings were robust to a variety of sensitivity analyses. Dynamic changes of normalized EPIC scores between the 3 groups are presented in the figure below. Conclusion(s): In the absence of a randomized clinical trial, this analysis suggests that monotherapeutic approaches should be preferred in the setting of favorable-risk PCa to preserve patients HRQoL. Ultimately, the questions of efficacy, toxicity, and HRQoL will be best answered by a randomized clinical trial.",exclusion,Not the right comparator (brachytherapy),,,,,,

We isolated the portfolio of trials that investigate the primary immunomodulatory properties of RT and examined recent trends in clinical trials that combine immunotherapy and RT (ITRT). Method(s): We queried clinicaltrials.gov for trials initiated since 2002 using both radiation and immunotherapy as mandated interventions. We designated the trials that examine the specific aspects of RT or its abscopal properties as ""Primary RT Immunomodulation"" trials. Chi-squared analysis determined differences between primary RT immunomodulation trials and those that incorporate RT as a secondary intervention. Joinpoint regression modeling determined the rate of change of the introduction of new trials over time. Result(s): One hundred and ninety trials met inclusion criteria. Targeted immunostimulatory agents, including checkpoint inhibitors, were the most common immunotherapy (n = 79 [41.6%]). Sixty-six (34.7%) trials included RT as the primary intervention, with 50 (75.6%) of these utilizing stereotactic body radiation (SBRT). All ITRT trials increased at a rate of 14.8% per year. Primary RT immunomodulation trials increased at a rate of 26.8% per year. Primary RT immunomodulation trials were more likely to utilize targeted immunostimulatory agents (p < 0.01), and SBRT (p < 0.01), and more likely to involve metastatic sites (p < 0.01). The number of ITRT studies increased drastically in the latest two years of the study. Conclusion(s): The number of new ITRT clinical trials is increasing rapidly. This increase in quantity may improve the clinical application of the immunomodulatory properties of RT.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",exclusion,review,Llegir per si podem recuperar algun estudi dels 50 que cita en què utilitzen SBRT,PM13,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13566-018-0351-x,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten patients were treated definitively for localized prostate cancer with SBRT to a dose of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions prescribed to a volume encompassing the prostate only. Dose-volume constraints were applied to the rectum, bladder, penile bulb, femoral heads, and prostatic and membranous urethra. Three-field passively scattered proton plans were retrospectively generated using target volumes from the same patients. Dosimetric indices were compared between the SBRT and proton plans using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: All dose constraints were achieved using both ultra-hypofractionated passively scattered proton and SBRT planning. Proton plans demonstrated significant improvement over SBRT in mean dose delivered to the penile bulb (5.2 CGE vs. 11.4 Gy; p=0.002), rectum (6.7 CGE vs. 10.6 Gy; p=0.002), and membranous urethra (32.2 CGE vs. 34.4 Gy; p=0.006) with improved target homogeneity resulting in a significant reduction in hot spots and volumes of tissue exposed to low doses of radiation. Compared to proton planning, SBRT planning resulted in significant improvement in target conformality with a mean index of 1.17 versus 1.72 (p=0.002), resulting in a dose reduction to the volume of bladder receiving more than 90% of the PD (V32.6, 7.5% vs. 15.9%; p=0.01) and mean dose to the left (7.1 Gy vs. 10.4 CGE; p=0.004) and right (4.0 Gy vs. 10.9 CGE; p=0.01) femoral heads. CONCLUSION: Target and normal tissue dose constraints for ultra-hypofractionated definitive radiotherapy of localized prostate cancer are readily achieved using both CK SBRT and passively scattered proton-based therapy suggesting feasibility of either modality.",exclusion,Other study design,,,10.3109/0284186X.2014.953260,,,

Clearly novel combinations are needed and a deeper understanding of immune resistance. Using a multi-arm, multi-stage platform design, the PORTER study will adaptively test multiple immunotherapeutic combinations to activate the innate and adaptive immune systems. Coupled with deep immune biomarker profiling, this design will enable rapid insights into the immune responses for each combination, providing data for potential larger definitive trials, while generating hypotheses for new cohorts. Methods PORTER is an open-label, non-randomized, exploratory platform study designed to assess the safety and antitumor activity of multiple immunotherapy combinations in participants with mCRPC who have received prior secondary androgen inhibition therapy. Each cohort has a two-stage design (initial n = 15, expansion n = 15) with a decision to expand based on the safety, clinical activity, and biomarker results observed in the initial stage. Cohort A is open and recruiting, testing the combination of bempegaldesleukin (?BEMPEG?, NKTR-214; a CD-122 preferential IL-2 pathway agonist) with nivolumab (PD-1 inhibitor), postulating that this will increase PD-L1 expression, intratumoral T and NK cells, and induce an IFN gamma signature. Cohort B will combine CDX-301 (Flt3L), poly-ICLC (PAMP-adjuvant), nivolumab and stereotactic body radiation therapy, in 1-5 metastatic sites, inducing immunogenic cell death, mobilizing and activating dendritic cells increasing tumor antigen presentation, and overcoming adaptive immune resistance in mCRPC. Cohort C will evaluate INO-5151, a DNA vaccine encoding PSA, PSMA, and IL-12 delivered via intramuscular electroporation, in addition to CDX-301 and nivolumab. This is a multi-pronged approach to mobilize and activate dendritic cells, stimulate anti-tumor CD8 T cells, and circumvent adaptive immune resistance.

Materials/Methods: From January 2011 to June 2013, 68 men were treated at 5 institutions on an institutional review boardeapproved trial with a primary QOL endpoint. SBRT used 5 fractions of 7.4 Gy to 37 Gy over 15 to 19 days. The clinical target volume was the prostate with a 3- mm planning target volume (PTV) and 2-mm action level. Daily bladder and bowel preparations were used. Dosimetric goals mirrored RTOG 0126 after a/b correction (bioeffective dose 3 Gy) with urethral constraints based on high-dose-rate monotherapy. QOL was evaluated by EPIC 26 with mean changes examined by paired t test. A minimally detectable decline (MDD) in QOL was defined as 7, 6, 5, and 11 points for urinary incontinence (UI), urinary obstructive (UO), bowel (BS), and sexual (SS) domains. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess associations between dosimetry and MDD or greater changes in QOL. Result(s): Median follow-up was 24 months (range 20-46). EPIC summary domains are in the table. There was not a statistically significant mean change for urinary QOL at any time. Significant mean BS changes were observed at 6 and 12 months but only the decline at 12 months met the threshold for an MDD. Mean declines in SS were observed at all times but only reached an MDD at 24 months. Despite no changes in mean urinary scores a detectable change in UI by MDD was seen in 17% and 18% at 6 and 24 months. At 6 months 41% had an MDD for UO with only 19% at 24 months. Bowel MDD was 33% at 6 months and 23% at 24 months. An MDD for SS was seen in 39% at 6 and 43% at 24 months. By ROC curve analysis Vrectum <=100% was associated with BS MDD at 6 (P=.049) and 24 months (P=.03) as was rectal absolute V90% (P=.02) and absolute V50% (P=.02) at 24 months. Absolute bladder volumes receiving 10 to 37 Gy were associated with MDD for UI at 24 months (P=.01-.03). Neither PTV nor urethral mean or max doses were associated with urinary QOL. No doses predicted sexual MDD. Conclusion(s): Prostate SBRT with real time tracking and urethral constraints led to no mean changes in urinary QOL; but absolute bladder dose/volumes correlated with the minority experiencing UI changes. Average bowel QOL decreased at 6 to 12 months but resolved by 24 months. Rectal V90-100 correlated with MDD. Electromagnetic transponder guided SBRT has minimal changes in QOL at 2 years. Nevertheless, optimized radiation planning may improve both urinary and bowel QOL. (Table presented).",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,,,,

In this work, we present a novel geometric method of margin derivation based on CBCT-derived anatomical data. METHODS: Twenty patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer were selected for retrospective review. Individual volumes of interest (prostate, prostate and seminal vesicles and pelvic lymph nodes) were delineated on five representative CBCTs and registered to the planning CT using two registration protocols: bone match or prostate-based soft tissue match. Margins were incrementally expanded around composite CTV structures until 95% overlap was achieved. RESULTS: CTV-PTV margins of 5.2, 6.5 and 7.6 mm were required for prostate, prostate and seminal vesicles and pelvic lymph nodes respectively using a prostate matching protocol. For the prostate and seminal vesicle structures, margins calculated using our method displayed good agreement with a conventional margin recipe (within ±1.0 mm). CONCLUSIONS: We have presented an alternative method of CTV-PTV margin derivation that is applicable to SABR treatments with more than one isocentric target. These results have informed an institutional trial of prostate and pelvic nodal SABR in men with high-risk localized prostate cancer.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,10.1186/s13014-017-0859-z,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Men scoring ≥3 on the Vulnerable Elderly Scale (VES) or refusing conventionally fractionated treatment for high-risk prostate cancer were eligible to participate. Androgen suppression was delivered for 12 months, and radiation therapy was delivered using 25 Gy to pelvic nodes delivered synchronously with 40 Gy to the prostate given as 1 fraction per week over 5 weeks. The phase 1 component included predetermined stopping rules based on 6-month treatment-related toxicity, with trial suspension specified if there were ≥6 of 15 patients (40%) or ≥3 of 15 (20%) who experienced grade ≥2 or ≥3 gastrointestinal (GI) or genitourinary (GU) toxicity, respectively. RESULTS: Sixteen men were enrolled, with 7 men meeting the criteria of VES ≥3 and 9 men having a VES <3 but choosing the condensed treatment. One man was not treated owing to discovery of a synchronous primary rectal cancer. Four patients (26%) experienced grade ≥2 toxicity at 6 weeks after treatment. There were 9 of 15 (60%) who experienced grade ≥2 GI or GU toxicity and 4 of 15 (26%) grade ≥3 GI or GU toxicity at 6 months, and 5 of 15 (30%) grade ≥2 GI and GU toxicity at 6 months. A review of the 15 cases did not identify any remedial changes, thus the phase 1 criteria were not met. CONCLUSION: This novel condensed treatment had higher than anticipated late toxicities and was terminated before phase 2 accrual.

Methods and Materials: Patients with localized spine metastases free from VCF associated with loss of vertebral height with a pain score >=4 using the visual analog scale were enrolled. Spine SABR was performed with 20 Gy delivered to the gross disease and 14 Gy to the contiguous bone marrow in a single fraction. Immediate, prophylactic vertebroplasty was performed within 1 month after spine SABR. The primary endpoint was pain response at 3 months compared to the historical control with external beam radiation therapy from Radiation Therapy Oncology Group study 9714. Secondary endpoints included pain response at 1 month, duration of pain response, vertebroplasty rate, VCF rate, local control, and overall survival. Result(s): Thirty-five patients were enrolled, of whom 29 were deemed eligible and underwent single-fraction spine SABR. Twenty-three of these patients subsequently underwent prophylactic vertebroplasty. The 3-month pain response was significantly improved compared to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group study 9714: 95% versus 51% (P <.0001). The local control with a median follow-up of 9.6 months was 92%. The freedom from VCF was 90% at 1 year. Spine SABR was well tolerated with no grade 2 or higher toxicities. A single patient with disease extending from the vertebral body into the spinal canal developed vertebroplasty-related myelopathy, which was corrected with surgery. Conclusion(s): Single-fraction SABR immediately followed by prophylactic vertebroplasty improves pain response compared with conventional radiation therapy while providing long-term pain control and structural stability of the treated spine. Vertebroplasty is well tolerated as a prophylactic measure in patients without loss of vertebral height after spine SABR. Pain response and VCF rates are similar to patients undergoing SABR alone. Thus, patients who would benefit most from the addition of vertebroplasty need to be further identified.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",exclusion,Not dealing with the intervention of interest (dealing with spine metastasis),,PM15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.01.072,,,

Material(s) and Method(s): Fraction sizes of 8 Gy, 8.5 Gy, and 9 Gy were defined as levels 1, 2, and 3. The prescribed dose was delivered to at least 95% of the planning target volume. Image-guided, intensity-modulated radiotherapy was delivered to all patients. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as acute toxicity of Grade 3 or higher. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the level at which >=30% of patients showed DLT. The recommended dose (RD) was defined to be one dose level below the MTD. If no patients at level 3 showed DLT, level 3 was defined as the recommended dose (RD). Result(s): Nine patients were enrolled in each level. All patients were low or intermediate risk. Median durations of follow-up for patients at levels 1-3 were 48.9 months, 42.6 months, and 18.4 months, respectively. Protocol treatment was completed for all patients. No patient showed DLT at each dose level. Level 3 was therefore designated as the RD for the phase II study. Although most toxicities were Grade 1, genitourinary toxicity was common compared to gastrointestinal toxicity. Three-year biochemical control rate was 90.3%.

We conducted a clinical trial of stereotactic hypofractionated radiation therapy delivered in once-weekly fractions on patients with all-risk non-metastatic disease to test feasibility, acute toxicities and patient-reported outcomes. Material(s) and Method(s): In this phase I/II study, 30 patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma, any Gleason score, T1-4N0 and prostate-specific antigen <=60 ng/ml were treated with volumetric intensity modulated arc radiation therapy to a dose of 35 Gy in five fractions delivered once weekly. Patients with high-risk disease also received elective nodal irradiation to a dose of 25 Gy in five fractions simultaneously. Androgen deprivation was offered to intermediate- and high-risk patients. The primary outcome was acute toxicity. Secondary outcome measures included biochemical control and late toxicity. Patient-reported outcomes were measured using the International Prostate Symptom Score and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (QLQ). Result(s): All 30 patients completed treatment per-protocol. Most patients had T3 (60%) and Gleason 7 (50%) tumours. The median prostate-specific antigen was 17 ng/ml. High-risk disease was present in 20 patients (66.7%). There was a low incidence of acute toxicities (grade 2 + urinary 3.3%, grade 2 rectal 0%). Within the EORTC QLQ framework, only the urinary symptom score showed a clinically meaningful worsening from a mean of 20/100 at baseline to 34/100 at the end of treatment (P < 0.001), but reduced to 24/100 at 6 months (P = 0.08). With a median follow-up of 41.5 months, two patients each reported grade 2 late urinary and rectal toxicity. The 3- and 4-year biochemical control rates were 96.7 and 87.9%, respectively.

Historically, salvage HDR has, but recently, advances in imaging have allowed for improved intraprostatic recurrence localization. We hypothesized that by using diagnostic multiparametric MRI and fluciclovine PET with MRI-based treatment planning, the salvage HDR therapeutic ratio could be improved by targeting the focal lesion in a single fraction. The FSHARP trial is currently studying this approach and we report the initial dosimetry and preliminary experience of patients enrolled on this study. Materials/Methods: FSHARP (NCT0331297) is a Phase I/II trial of salvage focal single fraction HDR for radiorecurrent prostate cancer in patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer after any form of definitive radiotherapy. The primary endpoint is 3-month RT-related CTCAE v4.03 grade >=3 genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity, with an initial 7 patient safety lead-in. Eligibility criteria include: initial diagnosis of cT1-T3a N0 M0 prostate adenocarcinoma, no evidence of metastases, and biopsy-proven local recurrence. All patients require a multiparametric MRI and biopsy of any target lesions. Patients undergo transrectal ultrasound-guided catheter placement followed by MRI-based treatment planning and HDR treatment. The planning target volume (PTV) is a 0-5 mm expansion around the gross tumor volume (GTV) avoiding surrounding critical structures. The prescription is to the periphery with the highest dose possible up to 30 Gy while not violating critical structure constraints and prioritizing GTV > PTV coverage. We performed a descriptive analysis of patient characteristics, dosimetry, and the acute EPIC-26 patient-reported quality of life of patients currently enrolled on the trial. Result(s): 11 of a planned 24 patients have been treated on trial and the initial safety lead-in has been completed, with enrollment ongoing. Prior definitive treatment included external beam radiotherapy (n=8), low dose rate brachytherapy (n=2), and stereotactic body radiotherapy (n=1), with a median of 67 months from the completion of prior radiotherapy. Median pre-salvage PSA was 6.3 (range: 2.6-13.5). The median number of HDR catheters was 17 (range: 13-22), and the median prescribed peripheral dose was 19 Gy (19-22). Median GTV was 5.4 cc (2.01-44.72). Median PTV was 23.7 cc (8.78-76.69). Median GTV D90 was 21.3 Gy (17.13-35.91), PTV D90 was 19.6 Gy (16.3-23.9) Conclusion(s): Accrual to the FSHARP trial is ongoing.

Importantly, biomarkers to determine patients who benefit most from complete ablation are unknown. We hypothesize that stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR) will improve oncologic outcomes in men with OMPC. Method(s): In this phase II randomized trial, men with recurrent hormone-sensitive OMPC (1 -3 radiation fields) were stratified by primary management (radiotherapy vs surgery), PSA doubling time, and prior androgen deprivation therapy and randomized 2:1 to SABR or observation (OBS). The primary endpoint was progression at 6 months by PSA (> 25% increase and > nadir + 2 ng/mL), conventional imaging (RECIST 1.1 criteria or new lesion on bone scan), or symptomatic decline. Tissue, liquid and imaging correlatives were analyzed as biomarkers. Result(s): From 5/2016-3/2018, 54 patients were randomized. Progression at six months occurred in 19% of SABR patients and 61% of observation patients [p=0.005]. SABR improved median PFS (not reached vs 5.8 months, HR 0.30, p = 0.0023). Total consolidation of PSMA radiotracer-avid disease decreased the risk of new lesions at six months (16% vs 63% p = 0.006). No toxicity > grade 3 was observed. T-cell receptor sequencing identified increased clonotypic expansion (p = 0.03) following SABR and correlation between baseline clonality and progression with SABR only. Analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and germline mutations identified a mutation profile that was associated with benefit from SABR. Conclusion(s): SABR for OMPC improves outcomes and is enhanced by total consolidation of disease identified by PSMA-targeted PET. SABR induces a systemic immune response, and baseline immune phenotype and tumor mutation status may predict the benefit from SABR.

The primary clinical endpoint will be progression at 6 months from randomization with the hypothesis that SABR to all metastases will forestall progression by disrupting the metastatic process. Secondary clinical endpoints will include local control at 6 months post-SABR, toxicity and quality of life, and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-free survival (ADT-FS). Further fundamental analysis of the oligometastatic state with be achieved through correlation with investigational (18)F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging and measurement of circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA, and circulating T-cell receptor repertoires, facilitating an unprecedented opportunity to characterize, in isolation, the effects of SABR on the dynamics of and immunologic response to oligometastatic disease. METHODS/DESIGN: Patients will be randomized 2:1 to SABR or observation with minimization to balance assignment by primary intervention, prior hormonal therapy, and PSA doubling time. Progression after 6 months will be compared using Fisher's exact test. Hazard ratios and Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression free survival (PFS), ADT free survival (ADT-FS), time to locoregional progression (TTLP) and time to distant progression (TTDP) will be calculated based on an intention-to-treat. Local control will be assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. Withdrawal from the study prior to 6 months will be counted as progression. Adverse events will be summarized by type and grade. Quality of life pre- and post- SABR will be measured by Brief Pain Inventory. DISCUSSION: The ORIOLE trial is the first randomized, non-blinded Phase II interventional study in the North America evaluating the safety and efficacy of SABR in oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.

random-journal.pdf,ProP28,"H., Hasan",2020,eng,pro.m:#2,A phase II randomized trial of RAdium-223 dichloride and SABR Versus SABR for oligomEtastatic prostate caNcerS (RAVENS),"Background: Metastasis directed therapy (MDT) for patients with oligometastatic disease is associated with improvements in progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to systemic therapy alone. Additionally, within a prostate-cancer-specific cohort, MDT is able to forestall initiation of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with hormone-sensitive, oligometastatic prostate cancer (HSOPCa) compared to observation. While MDT appears to be safe and effective in HSOPCa, a large percentage of men will eventually have disease recurrence. Patterns of failure in HSOPCa demonstrate patients tend to have recurrence in the bone following MDT, raising the question of sub-clinically-apparent osseous disease. Radium-223 dichloride is a radiopharmaceutical with structural similarity to calcium, allowing it to be taken up by bone where it emits alpha particles, and therefore might have utility in the treatment of micrometastatic osseous disease. Therefore, the primary goal of the phase II RAVENS trial is to evaluate the efficacy of MDT + radium-223 dichloride in prolonging progression free survival in men with HSOPCa. Method(s): Patients with HSOPCa and 3 or less metastases with at least 1 bone metastasis will be randomized 1:1 to stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR, also known as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)) alone vs SABR + radium-223 dichloride with a minimization algorithm to balance assignment by institution, primary intervention, prior hormonal therapy, and PSA doubling time. SABR is delivered in one to five fractions and patients in the SABR + radium-223 dichloride arm will receive six infusions of radium-223 dichloride at four-week intervals. The primary end point is progression free survival. The secondary clinical endpoints include toxicity and quality of life assessments, local control at 12 months, locoregional progression, time to distant progression, time to new metastasis, and duration of response. Discussion(s): The RAVENS trial will be the first described phase II, non-blinded, randomized study to compare SABR +/- radium-223 dichloride in patients with HSOPCa and 3 or less metastases with at least one bone metastasis. The primary hypothesis is that SABR + radium-223 dichloride will increase median progression-free survival from 10 months in the SABR arm to 20 months in the SABR + radium-223 dichloride arm.

A hydrogel spacer is used to reduce the rectal toxicity, but the clinical data of SBRT with hydrogel spacer are limited. The aim of this prospective single-center phase II study was to determine the efficacy and safety of FFF-VMAT SBRT combined with hydrogel spacer for localized prostate cancer. Materials/Methods: Men with localized prostate cancer were eligible for the study. A hydrogel spacer was inserted into the perirectal space between prostate and rectum before the initiation of SBRT. All patients underwent the planning CT scans before and after the spacer placement. Patients received 36.25 Gy to 95% of the PTV in 5 fractions every other day excluding weekends with 6MV single arc FFF-VMAT. The primary endpoint was acute toxicities during and within 3 months after the completion of SBRT. Toxicities were assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03. The secondary endpoints were International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and quality of life (QOL) assessed by the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire. Target and normal tissue dosimetry were compared before and after the hydrogel spacer insertion. Result(s): Between February 2017 and July 2018, forty patients with localized prostate cancer were enrolled. The median age was 70 years (55-79). Three, 25, 6, and 6 patients had low-, intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk prostate cancer according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk classification. Twenty-three patients (58%) received concomitant androgen deprivation therapy. The hydrogel spacer placement was successful in 39 cases (98%). Seven (18%) and eighteen patients (45%) developed grade 2 acute gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities, respectively. No grade 3 acute toxicities were observed. Median IPSS temporarily increased at 2 weeks and 1 month after RT when compared to the pretreatment baseline (P < 0.05, 0.05, respectively), and returned to the baseline value in 3 months. EPIC urinary and bowel scores significantly declined at 2 weeks and 1 month after RT (P <0.05, 0.05, respectively), and no difference was observed at 3 months post-RT. Spacer use was associated with lower rectum dose for mean dose, maximum dose, and V100% to V50% (all P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): FFF-VMAT SBRT with a hydrogel spacer can be safely administered with acceptable acute toxicity. Hydrogel spacer insertion significantly reduced the dose to the rectum.Copyright © 2019",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.06.1851,,,

These men have normal traditional imaging and a disease-free interval usually measured in years from their definitive treatment. Recent data supports the use of metastasis-directed stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in oligometastatic PCa. Based on our institutional data in 57 patients treated with SBRT alone in the PSMA era, the median PSA progression free survival (PFS) is 11 months. Despite 100% local control, 80% relapsed by 18 months. Improving the PFS for these men is an important clinical need. Achieving this without the introduction of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) will likely improve quality of life and minimise the adverse consequences of androgen deprivation. Radiotherapy results in cell stress and release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) with activation of antigen presenting cells. This stimulates a tumour antigen specific T-cell response and abscopal effect which can be heightened with PD-(L)1 inhibition. Most PD-(L)1 inhibition trials in PCa are in men with a high burden of castrate resistant disease. However, data suggests the castrate state can impair host anti-tumour immune response. PD-(L)1 inhibition combined with SBRT in androgen-intact men may result in improved PFS compared with our historical cohort treated with SBRT alone. Method(s): This is a non-randomized, open label, phase II study of durvalumab (1500 mg IV every 4 weeks) starting 1 month prior to SBRT in men with recurrent PCa not immediately requiring ADT and with Ga68-PSMA PET detected oligometastasis. SBRT will be delivered with 30Gy/3# to lymph nodes or 24Gy/2# to bone metastasis. Durvalumab will be continued to a maximum of 12 months. Primary outcomes will be freedom from biochemical failure and toxicity. Secondary objectives include biochemical response rate, magnitude of response, overall survival, time and response to subsequent treatments and quality of life.

The present randomized phase II study aimed to compare 2 SSRS schedules to determine which results the lowest rate of grade 3 or higher protocol-specified adverse events at 4 months. Materials/Methods: Patients with biopsy-proven non-hematogenous malignancy and limited un-irradiated spine metastases not requiring upfront spine surgery were eligible. Patients were randomized to receive either 16 Gy in 1 fraction or 24 Gy in 3 fractions on every other day. This study was designed to detect a protocol-specified adverse event rate > 20% at a 10% significance level (1-sided) and 90% power. Secondary analysis included time to treatment failure, which was defined as presence of grade 3 or higher adverse events or unequivocal local progression of treated spine(s) indicative of re-irradiation or surgical intervention. Designating the preferable of the 2 schedules was based on rules of protocol-specified adverse events and treatment failure rate for each arm. Result(s): Between November 2015 and October 2018, 50 patients (pts) were enrolled for SSRS to 75 metastatic spinal lesions, including 41 lung cancer, 2 breast cancer, 2 head and neck cancer, 2 liver cancer, 2 prostate cancer, and 1 colon cancer. The median age was 62 years old (range 36-79). There were 1 cervical, 41 thoracic, 31 lumbar, and 2 sacral sites for SSRS. Twenty-six patients were randomized to the single-fraction (SF) arm, and 24 patients were randomized to the multi-fraction (MF) arm. The median follow-up time was 11.73 months (range 0.67-39 months). At 4 months, none of the 25 evaluable patients in the SF arm experienced any protocol-specified grade 3 or higher toxicity, but 1 out of the 21 evaluable patients in the MF arm underwent surgical intervention due to progressive compression fracture. During longer follow-up, 2 patients in the SF arm and five additional patients in the MF arm developed treatment failure. The median time to treatment failure was 13.5 months for SF arm, and 8 months for MF arm. The one-year treatment failure rate was significantly worse in the MF arm (SF 5.6% versus MF 14.3%, p=0.04). Conclusion(s): Both SF and MF SSRS seem safe and the SF arm has met its primary endpoint. The interim analysis suggests 16 Gy in single fraction might be the preferable SSRS schedule and warrants longer follow-up as well as further investigation.Copyright © 2019",exclusion,Other tumor treated (spinal),,PM26,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.06.477,,,
random-journal.pdf,ProP32,"A.M.E., Bruynzeel",2019,eng,pro.p,A Prospective Single-Arm Phase 2 Study of Stereotactic Magnetic Resonance Guided Adaptive Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Early Toxicity Results.,"PURPOSE: Use of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is increasing in patients with localized prostate cancer, but concerns about early and late gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity exist after moderately or extremely hypofractionated radiation therapy schemes. Magnetic resonance guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) was clinically introduced in 2014. MrgRT allows for SBRT delivery with smaller uncertainty margins and permits daily adaptive planning. A phase 2 study in patients with localized prostate cancer was performed to study early GI and GU toxicity after SBRT using MRgRT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: One hundred one patients with clinical stage T1-3bN0M0 prostate cancer were enrolled in this prospective phase 2 study. All but 4 patients had intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer, and 82.2% received adjuvant hormonal treatment. MRgRT was delivered in 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy to the target volume using daily plan adaptation with simultaneous relative sparing of the urethra to a dose of 6.5 Gy per fraction. Early toxicity was studied using both clinician- (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) and patient-reported outcome measurements (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30, Quality of Life Questionnaire PR25, and International Prostate Symptom Scoring). RESULTS: The maximum cumulative grade ≥2 early GU and GI toxicity measured by any symptom at any study time point was 23.8% and 5.0%, respectively. No early grade 3 GI toxicity was observed. Early grade 3 GU toxicity was 0% and 5.9% according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and scoring systems, respectively, as a result of different grading of radiation cystitis. The low incidence of early GI toxicity was confirmed by patient-reported outcome data. GU grade ≥2 toxicity peaked to 19.8% at the end of MRgRT, followed by a return to the baseline average score at 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study of MRgRT in patients with localized prostate cancer observed a low incidence of early GI and GU toxicity, both in clinician- and patient-reported outcome measurements.",exclusion,Other study design (phase I/II),,,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.08.007,,,

This is a long and inconvenient treatment for patients. Brachytherapy boost treatment studies indicate that escalation of biological dose of radiotherapy (RT) can improve outcomes in HR-PrCa. However, brachytherapy is an invasive treatment associated with increased toxicity and requires specialized resources. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a promising, non-invasive alternative to brachytherapy. However, its impact on patient quality of life (QoL) and RT-associated toxicity has not been investigated in a randomized setting. In this study, we investigate SBRT as a boost treatment, following pelvic CF-EBRT, in patients with HR-PrCa treated with ADT. One hundred patients with locally advanced PrCa will be randomized to receive daily CF-EBRT of 45 to 46 Gy in 23 to 25 fractions followed by either daily CF-EBRT of 32 to 33 Gy in 15 to 16 fractions (control arm) or SBRT boost treatment of 19.5 to 21 Gy in 3 fractions (1 fraction per week) (experimental arm). The primary objective of the PBS trial is early bowel and urinary QoL (expanded prostate index composite [EPIC], up to 6 months after RT). This phase II randomized study (PBS) provides an appropriate setting to investigate effectively the impact of SBRT boost on QoL and toxicity in patients with HR-PrCa, before this modality can be compared against the current standard of care in larger phase III protocols.",inclusion,,,,"10.1016/j.clgc.2019.12.020random-journal.pdf,

Most data to support locally-directed treatment, such as stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), for oligometastases are from retrospective institutional reports. Following the success of a recently completed and reported phase II trial demonstrating important clinical outcomes, herein we review the current landscape of ongoing clinical trials in this context. Materials and methods: A review of currently activated and registered clinical trials was performed using the clinicaltrials.gov database from inception to February 2019. A search of actively recruiting trials, using the key words oligometastases, SABR, and various related terms was performed. Search results were independently reviewed by two investigators, with discrepancies settled by a third. Data abstracted from identified studies included study type, primary disease site, oncologic endpoints, and inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results: Of the initial 216 entries identified, 64 met our review eligibility criteria after full-text review. The most common study type was a phase II clinical trial (n = 35, 55%) with other study designs ranging from observational registry trials to phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A minority of trials were randomized in design (n = 17, 27%). While most studies allowed for metastases from multiple primary disease sites (n = 22, 34%), the most common was prostate (n = 13, 15%), followed by breast, gastrointestinal, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and renal (n = 6, 9% each). In studies with a solitary target site, the most common was liver (n = 6, 9%) followed by lung (n = 3, 5%). The most common primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) (n = 20, 31%) and toxicity (n = 10, 16%). A combined strategy of systemic therapy and SABR was an emerging theme (n = 23, 36%), with more recent studies specifically evaluating SABR and immunotherapy (n = 9, 14%). Conclusion: The safety and efficacy of SABR as oligometastasis-directed treatment is increasingly being evaluated within prospective clinical trials. These data are awaited to compliment the abundance of existing observational studies and to guide clinical decision-making.",exclusion,,Incloure com a font per detectar altres estudis en curs,PM28,10.3389/fonc.2019.00543,,,

We report an update of a multicentre, Canadian randomized phase II study to investigate the impact of overall treatment time on quality of life (QOL), efficacy, and toxicity. METHODS: Men with intermediate risk prostate cancer were randomized to 40 Gy in 5 fractions delivered every other day (EOD) versus once per week (QW). Primary outcome was proportion of patients experiencing a minimally clinically important change (MCIC) in acute bowel QOL using EPIC. Secondary outcomes were toxicity, biochemical failure (BF), other QOL domains, and the rate of salvage therapy. FINDINGS: 152 men from 3 centers were randomized; the median follow-up was 62 months. Results are described for EOD versus QW. Acute bowel and urinary QOL was reported previously. Late changes in QOL were not significantly different between the two arms. There were 1 (1.3%) vs 3 (2.7%) late grade 3 + GI toxicities (p = 0.36) and 5 (6.7%) vs 2 (2.7%) late grade 3 GU toxicities (p = 0.44). Two and 5 patients had BF (5-year failure rate 3.0 vs 7.2%, p = 0.22); 0 and 4 patients received salvage therapy (p = 0.04). 5-Year OS and CSS was 95.8% and 98.6% with no difference between arms (p = 0.49, p = 0.15). 3 patients in the QW arm developed metastases. INTERPRETATION: Although we previously reported that weekly prostate SABR had better bowel and urinary QOL compared to EOD, the updated results show no difference in late toxicity, QOL, BF, or PSA kinetics.

Purpose/Objective(s): since November 2015, 30 patients were enrolled in an IRB approved prospectively randomized study to receive either 45Gy in 5 daily fractions (Hypo-SBRT) or 24Gy SDRT. Patients with a baseline IPSS score >15, a previous transurethral prostate resection, or a gland size >100 cc were not eligible. Treatment protocols were based on VMAT-IGRT techniques with urethral sparing and real-time motion management with beacon transponders, and the CTV included the prostate gland and seminal vesicles, and a 2 mm margin for PTV expansion. Accurate anatomical reproducibility was achieved via the placement of an endorectal balloon filled with air (150 cc) and a Foley catheter loaded with the becon trasponders. This setup conferred excellent organ motion mitigation and online tracking ensured treatment delivery was always within the 2 mm PTV/CTV margin. Acute toxicity within the first three months was defined as a primary endpoint. Genito-urinary (GU) and gastro-intestinal (GI) toxicity were graded according to the NCI CTCAE v.4 and QoL was assessed by EPIC and IPSS questionnaires. Result(s): a total of 15 patients were accrued to each protocol arm, and a minimum follow-up of 3 months was achieved in all patients (range, 3-15). Treatment acceptance and protocol compliance were complete. No grade >=2 acute GI or GU toxicities were observed in either group. G1 GU and GI toxicities in the hypo arm were 18% and 0%, respectively and 41% and 8%, respectively in the SDRT arm. There were no significant differences in mean EPIC scores in all domains between the two groups. At one-month post treatment, a 6% and 8% drop in the EPIC urinary domain scores occurred in the hypo and SDRT arm, respectively. The scores returned to baseline at the 3 months in both groups. Similarly, at 1-month median IPSS values in the hypo and SDRT arm increased from 7 to 11 and from 7 to 10, respectively, but returned to the baseline value of 7 at 3-months. These observations recapitulated the acute toxicity profiles observed in a phase I/II single arm hypofractionated study (5x9Gy daily, in 200 cases) and a phase I pilot study of 24Gy SDRT in radiation-surgery-naive prostates failing androgen ablation (28 patients) using the same technique as described above, both completed before initiation of the presently reported trial. Conclusion(s): These early trial endpoints indicate that 24Gy SDRT with urethral sparing and real-time motion management can be consistently and safely delivered and is associated with acceptable treatment-related symptoms. QoL profiles are consistent with the low rates of mild GU and GI toxicities. Other primary endpoints (i.e. late toxicity, biochemical outcomes and 24 months post-treatment biopsy) have not been reached.",inclusion,"Shorter follow-up than required, small number of patients.","Considerar-lo si no tenim prou evidència.

We have performed a phase II study to evaluate the feasibility and acute toxicity of a stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with a dose of 42 Gy in 7 fractions in patients with localized prostate cancer at low/intermediate risk (according to NCCN score) and risk of lymph node involvement <17%. Material(s) and Method(s): Since 2012, 40 patients at low/intermediate risk for localized prostate cancer have been planned for SBRT [Table 1]. Fraction size is 6 Gy for 7 fractions scheduled to be delivered twice a week for a total dose of 42 Gy. Treatment is been delivered with a VMAT technique, with 2 arcs using 6MV photons from a Varian 2300 iX linac, planned with Eclipse 10.0 TPS by the AAA algorithm carried out by 3 different planners. Dose prescription is the average dose to PTV with the request V95%>= 95%. The DVH constraints for OAR's have been derived from literature and local experience. To reduce the organ motion, patients has been premedicated before treatment with Butylscopolamine. The protocol is based on 3 IGRT intraprostatic fiducial markers, with daily online checks by CBCT. The acute and late toxicity has been recorded using the RTOG / EORTC scale and additional data has been collected by means of II-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) E IIEF-5 (International Index of Erectile Function) questionnaires. Result(s): Thirty-two patients have been followed for three months or more while thirteen patients for 12 months or more. At 3 month, 12% of patients reported grades 1 urinary toxicities . At 6 months no patients reported grade 1 urinary toxicities. At 18 months, one patient each reported grade 1 proctitis and grade 1 rectal bleeding which resolved without intervention. Biochemical response was rapid the first 12 months of follow up: mean pre-treatment and 12-month post-treatment values were 3,75 ng/ml and 0.7 ng/ml respectively. By using pharmacological premedication of the patient we have a control of organ motion intrafraction (OMI) <= 2 mm in 98% of treatment sessions. The results of OMI movement are shown in Figure 1. Conclusion(s): Intrafraction motion of the prostate is minimal when the patient follows the special diet and are premedicated before treatment with Butylscopolamine. The proposed scheme is estimated more effective to highdose conventional regimens. The absence of acute toxicity seems to confirm the validity of the adopted NTCP model and could be predictive of late toxicity. At this early follow up point, prostate SBRT results in favorable toxicity and biochemical outcomes and appears to support the strategy of hypofractionation in the management of localized prostate cancer. Further follow up is necessary to validate these early, promising results.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,,,,

New objective methods of predicting overall survival would be beneficial for surgical decision making. Morphometrics quantifies patient frailty and has been successfully used to predict overall survival in patients with lung cancer spinal metastases. This study evaluated whether morphometrics can predict survival in patients with prostate cancer spinal metastases. METHODS: Using a retrospective registry of patients with spinal metastases who underwent stereotactic body radiation therapy, we identified patients with primary prostate cancer. Morphometric measurements of the psoas muscle were taken from most recent lumbar spine computed tomography. Patients were stratified into lowest, middle, and highest tertiles based on psoas muscle area. Primary outcome measure was overall survival from the date of computed tomography scan. RESULTS: We identified 92 patients. Median survival for all patients was 124 days (95% confidence interval, 98-197 days). Patients in the smallest third for average psoas size had significantly shorter survival compared with patients in the largest third: 117 days versus 302 days (hazard ratio 2.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-4.43; P = 0.004). Patients in the middle third for average psoas size also had shorter survival compared with patients in the largest third: 113 days versus 302 days (hazard ratio 2.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-4.25; P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with prostate cancer spinal metastases, morphometric analysis of psoas muscle size can identify patients at risk for shorter survival. This technique can aid in surgical decision making by weighing expected survival and fitness versus potential morbidity of intervention.",exclusion,Other tumor treated (spinal),,PM34,10.1016/j.wneu.2018.03.115,,,
random-journal.pdf,ProP42,"Bernard, Brandon",2016,eng,pro.m:#5;pro.p:#5,Approach to Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer.,"Oligometastatic prostate cancer has increasingly been recognized as a unique clinical state with therapeutic implications. It has been proposed that patients with oligometastases may have a more indolent course and that outcome may be further improved with metastasis-directed local ablative therapy. In addition, there are differing schools of thoughts regarding whether oligometastases represent isolated lesions-where targeted therapy may render a patient disease free-or whether they coexist with micrometastases, where targeted therapy in addition to systemic therapy is required for maximal clinical impact. As such, the approach to the patient with oligometastatic prostate cancer requires multidisciplinary consideration, with surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic therapy potentially of benefit either singularly or in combination. Indeed, mounting evidence suggests durable disease-free intervals and, in some cases, possibly cure, may be achieved with such a multimodal strategy. However, selecting patients that may benefit most from treatment of oligometastases is an ongoing challenge. Moreover, with the advent of new, highly sensitive imaging technologies, the spectrum based on CT of the abdomen and pelvis and technetium bone scan of localized to oligometastatic to widespread disease has become increasingly blurred. As such, new MRI- and PET-based modalities require validation. As some clinical guidelines advise against routine prostate-specific antigen screening, the possibility of more men presenting with locally advanced or de novo oligometastatic prostate cancer exists; thus, knowing how best to treat these patients may become more relevant at a population level. Ultimately, the arrival of prospective clinical data and better understanding of biology will hopefully further inform how best to treat men with this disease.",exclusion,review,Llegir per a informació general sobre oligometastasis,PM35,10.1200/EDBK_159241,,,

Methods and Materials: This retrospective analysis included 27,443 patients representing 134 NRG Oncology's radiation-based clinical trials.trials with primary efficacy results published from 1985-2011. Trials were separated on the basis of the primary endpoint (fixed time vs event driven). The cumulative incidence approach was used to estimate time to attrition, and cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess factors associated with attrition. Result(s): Most patients (69%) were enrolled in an event-driven trial (n = 18,809), while 31% were enrolled in a fixed-time trial (n = 8634). Median follow-up time for patients enrolled in fixed-time trials was 4.1 months and 37.2 months for patients enrolled in event-driven trials. Fixed time trials with a duration < 6 months had a 5 month attrition rate of 4.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.4%, 5.5%) and those with a duration >= 6 months had a 1 year attrition rate of 1.6% (95% CI: 1.2, 2.1). Event-driven trials had 1- and 5-year attrition rates of 0.5% (95% CI: 0.4%, 0.6%) and 13.6% (95% CI: 13.1%, 14.1%), respectively. Younger age, female gender, and Zubrod performance status >0 were associated with greater attrition as were enrollment by institutions in the West and South regions and participation in fixed-time trials. Conclusion(s): Attrition in clinical trials can have a negative effect on trial outcomes. Data on factors associated with attrition can help guide the development of strategies to enhance retention. These strategies should focus on patient characteristics associated with attrition in both fixed-time and event-driven trials as well as in differing geographic regions of the country.Copyright © 2018",exclusion,Not dealing with the intervention of interest,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2018.04.078,,,

Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring - KIM - is an in-house developed advanced image guided radiotherapy technology that provides real-time translation and rotational target motion. The KIM technology has progressed to the multi-center phase II Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) 15.01 Stereotactic Prostate Adaptive Radiotherapy Utilizing KIM (SPARK) trial (NCT02397317). The purpose of this study was to measure the early clinical outcomes from the SPARK trial. Method(s): 48/ 48 patients with localized prostate cancer from five cancer centers have been recruited to the SPARK trial. All patients were treated with KIM-guided gating (38 patients) or KIM-guided MLC tracking (10 patients). The prescription dose was 36.25 Gy in five fractions. Three clinical outcomes were measured (a) patient-reported outcomes using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) instrument, (b) prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and (c) physician-graded toxicity (CTCAE version (d) in the erectile dysfunction (ED), gastrointestinal (GI) and urinary domains. Biochemical failure was defined using the RTOG Phoenix definition. The 17/48 patients with >=12 months of follow-up were included in this analysis. Result(s): Patient reported outcomes at 12-months compared to pre-treatment showed no differences in quality of life in the urinary, bowel, sexual or hormonal domains. The mean PSA dropped from 5.5 ng/L at baseline to 1.3 ng/L at 12 months. There were no biochemical failures observed. The mean erectile dysfunction improved from 1.0 to 0.9. No GI or urinary toxicity grade >=2 was observed. There was no GI toxicity and only one grade 1 urinary toxicity at 12 months follow-up. Conclusion(s): Advanced imaging technology development from bench-to-bedside has been successfully achieved in a phase II prostate cancer SABR clinical trial.

Intensification of systemic treatment is the standard of care. Recently, (68)Ga prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) imaging was introduced to identify oligometastatic prostate cancer patients. In this retrospective, exploratory study, we report on the efficacy of PSMA-PET-guided local ablative radiotherapy (aRT) in 15 oligometastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients, selected from our prospective institutional database and treated between 2013 and 2016. After multidisciplinary discussion, aRT was delivered with two different schedules. Androgen deprivation therapy remained unchanged. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and time to PSA progression were analysed. For comparison, individual time to PSA progression without aRT was estimated by individual PSA doubling time (PSADT). PSA response was observed in 11 patients (73%). Mean time to PSA progression or last follow-up was 17.9mo, as opposed to 2.9mo estimated from the PSADT without aRT (p<0.001). A relevant subset of CRPC patients had a PSA response with aRT to PET-positive lead metastases. A prospective trial is in preparation. PATIENT SUMMARY: In selected patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase during androgen deprivation, metastases were detected with prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography imaging. Fifteen patients with three or fewer metastases were treated with high-dose radiotherapy. Subsequently, PSA values dropped in 11 patients and in six patients no PSA progression was detected for >12mo.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,PM38,10.1016/j.eururo.2018.11.050,,,

Most recurrences in this scenario are characterized by continuous PSA rises and failure of standard imaging (bone scan [BS] and computed tomography [CT]) to detect recurrence sites. We conducted a Phase II trial for men with rising PSA after MLT using 18F-DCFPyL PET-MR/CT followed by targeted ablation of PET positive foci. We report the results of our pre-defined analysis. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients with rising PSA (0.4 - 3.0 ng/mL) after MLT, negative BS/CT and no prior salvage ADT were eligible. All patients underwent 18F-DCFPyL PET-MR followed by immediate PET-CT acquisition. Those with limited disease, where possible, underwent stereotactic ablative RT (SABR) or surgery. No ADT was used. The primary endpoint was biochemical response rate (complete [undetectable PSA] or partial [PSA decline >=50% compared to baseline]). A Simon's two stage study design was employed. Stage 1 included 12 response-evaluable patients, requiring one or more responses in the absence of Grade 3+ toxicities to proceed to Stage 2 (additional 25 response-evaluable patients). Result(s): After a median of 58 months (range 29-120) post MLT, 20 patients underwent PET-MR/CT to have 12 response-evaluable patients. Median PSA at enrollment was 1.3 ng/mL (range 0.4-2.8). Three patients had negative PET-MR/CT, while 17 had positive scans, of which 12 (60%) were amenable to response-evaluable ablation. The median number of detected lesions in those treated was 2 (range 1-5). Ten patients underwent SABR (27-30 Gy / 3 fractions) and two had surgery. One patient (8%) had complete and four (33%) had partial PSA responses at a median of 3.3 months (range 2.8-6.0) after ablation, while the remaining seven (59%) did not have biochemical response. No Grade 3+ toxicities were observed. Conclusion(s): 18F-DCFPyL PET-MR/CT has high detection rates in men with rising PSA after MLT. We observed favorable early results with SABR or surgery (41% RR; no Grade 3+ toxicities). Accrual completion and preliminary results on the entire cohort are expected for Q1 and Q3 2019, respectively.

Including multiple cohorts each with a different primary tumour site, allows efficient evaluation of safety of SBRT and feasibility of conducting subsequent cohort specific phase III trials; however this also presents several challenges for both trial design and management. Methods and Results: Trial eligibility criteria and patient pathways needed to be carefully considered to fit with different standard of care pathways for each cohort, whilst allowing for a combined analysis. Expertise for each cohort during protocol development and on oversight committees was essential. Similarly, at sites, liaising with three different clinical teams was common, necessitating a coordinated approach and more resources. The trial design originally assumed even recruitment across cohorts, but practically, while recruitment to breast and lung cohorts was as predicted, recruitment to prostate exceeded expectations. With a single recruitment target over all cohorts, the larger number of prostate cancer patients recruited impacted on the statistical assumptions. Recruitment to the prostate cohort was temporarily suspended, while engagement with breast and lung communities was increased, amendments to the protocol were made to improve recruitment to these cohorts and discussions around the implications to the trial design were had with the Trial Steering Committee. The control group progression-free survival estimate was revised based on the recruitment ratio seen between the cohorts and therefore the sample size was increased. Discussion(s): Recruitment was completed in February 2019. Frequent collaboration with the trial oversight committees and sites, and close monitoring of recruitment, enabled effective trial design and management to maximise the information gained from the trial, including the feasibility of subsequent phase III trials.",exclusion,Article on challenges of trial protocol,Check whether there are new results published from this clinical study (CORE Study NCT02759783),PM41,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-019-3688-6,,,

Recent clinical data suggest that prostate cancer patients following stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), if well tolerated, have little lasting impact on long-term urinary quality of life. This longitudinal study presents the changes in early urination control for patients who underwent SBRT comparing with a community-based cohort. Materials/Methods: In this two-year study, we studied 75 prostate cancer patients from a prospective clinical trial, and 127 men without cancer diagnosis from a community-dwelling population (Caminemos study; a 100% Latino population with sedentary lifestyle) with a similar mean age (71.7 and 72.9, respectively). Both cohorts assessed frequency of urinary leakage in one-month intervals at baseline, 1, 12, and 24 months. We stratified the data consistently into 5 responses: never, less than one time per week, two to three times per week, once per day, several times per day/ all the time. The combination of this sample allowed us to explore the incidence and severity of urinary leakage in prostate cancer patients prior to and following SBRT treatment using a non-cancer cohort as a comparison group. Longitudinal logistic and Poisson regression models were used to compare the risk and severity of having urinary leakage between the two cohorts. Both models were adjusted by age and race. Result(s): Stereotactic body radiation therapy patients reported higher incidence of urinary leakage at baseline (prior to treatment) compared to the non-cancer population, but the difference was not statistically significant (18.1% and 21.3% respectively, P=.36). The incidence of reporting urinary leakage increased gradually from 1 month to 24 months for both cohorts. At 24 months, the increment was 8.9% for non-cancer population (P=.04), and 13.5% for SBRT patients (P=.03). The time trends between the two cohorts were parallel over the two year study period (P=.74). The patterns of severity were comparable between the two cohorts at each time point, and the difference of time trend between the two cohorts remained constant from 1 to 24 months. The effect estimates remained the same when we further adjusted for comorbidity. Conclusion(s): This two-year data suggests that increasing loss of urinary control, in terms of self-reported urinary leakage, is comparable between prostate cancer patients treated with SBRT and the non-cancer population. The decreasing ability to early urination control is unlikely to be a treatment- related side effect. Rather, the progression of urinary leakage may simply be due to the nature of aging. The current evidence supports excellent urinary quality of life among prostate cancer patients treated with SBRT.",exclusion,Not the right comparator,,,,,,

Leading edge targeted molecular imaging techniques show promise for identification of potentially targetable lesions not apparent on conventional imaging (CT, MRI, or bone scan). We have characterized the impact of the investigational prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based 18F-DCFPyL PET imaging on the detection and radiotherapeutic management of prostate cancer. Purpose/Objective(s): Records from 31 patients who underwent 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging as part of clinical trials at our institution and were subsequently treated with radiotherapy between June 2015 and February 2017 were reviewed. The concordance of this technique with conventional imaging, its ability to detect new sites of disease, and the resultant effects on treatment modality, radiation target volumes, and dose prescription were analyzed and tabulated. Result(s): 18F-DCFPyl PET radiotracer uptake was observed in 30 patients with PSA values ranging from undetectable to 360 ng/mL (median 0.4 ng/mL). Lesions not appreciated on conventional imaging were identified in 71% of the cohort, while 23% of patients had lesions indeterminate on conventional imaging that demonstrated no radiotracer uptake. Changes in radiotherapy management following 18F-DCFPyl PET imaging include: 52% of patients were treated with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) to newly appreciated lesions; pelvic nodes demonstrating uptake were boosted in 23%; and salvage radiotherapy IMRT fields were asymmetrically expanded to boost areas of radiotracer uptake in the prostate bed in 6%. An additional 23% of patients were spared treatment to lesions assessed as less concerning based on lack of radiotracer avidity. Conclusion(s): 18F-DCFPyL PET imaging provides unique diagnostic data complementary to conventional techniques. This can impact initial TNM staging, effect treatment paradigms for recurrent disease, guide radiotherapy treatment planning by identifying lesions not otherwise appreciated and elucidating the character of indeterminate lesions. Importantly, radiotracer uptake can be seen at low and even undetectable PSA levels, potentially allowing earlier detection and treatment of low-volume metastases, a major goal in the evolving treatment of oligometastatic prostate cancer. Recognized limitations of this preliminary report include lack of biopsy confirmation of radiotracer-avid lesions and long term follow up to correlate treatment decisions with clinical outcomes, however these questions are areas of ongoing prospective investigation at our institution.",exclusion,Not dealing with the intervention of interest,Compares two imaging techniques,PM42,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.06.1224,,,

We sought to identify prognostic criteria in oligometastatic patients undergoing definitive hypofractionated image-guided radiotherapy (HIGRT). METHODS: Exclusively extracranial oligometastatic patients treated with HIGRT were pooled. Characteristics including age, sex, primary tumor type, interval to metastatic diagnosis, number of treated metastases and organs, metastatic site, prior systemic therapy for primary tumor treatment, prior definitive metastasis-directed therapy, and systemic therapy for metastasis associated with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and treated metastasis control (TMC) were assessed by the Cox proportional hazards method. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) identified prognostic risk strata for OS and PFS based on pretreatment factors. RESULTS: 361 patients were included. Primary tumors included non-small cell lung (17%), colorectal (19%), and breast cancer (16%). Three-year OS was 56%, PFS was 24%, and TMC was 72%. On multivariate analysis, primary tumor, interval to metastases, treated metastases number, and mediastinal/hilar lymph node, liver, or adrenal metastases were associated with OS. Primary tumor site, involved organ number, liver metastasis, and prior primary disease chemotherapy were associated with PFS. OS RPA identified five classes: class 1: all breast, kidney, or prostate cancer patients (BKP) (3-year OS 75%, 95% CI 66-85%); class 2: patients without BKP with disease-free interval of 75+ months (3-year OS 85%, 95% CI 67-100%); class 3: patients without BKP, shorter disease-free interval, ≤ two metastases, and age < 62 (3-year OS 55%, 95% CI 48-64%); class 4: patients without BKP, shorter disease-free interval, ≥ three metastases, and age < 62 (3-year OS 38%, 95% CI 24-60%); class 5: all others (3-year OS 13%, 95% CI 5-35%).

Materials/Methods: 405 patients were enrolled on prospective studies of SBRT (8 Gy x 5 fractions) for localized prostate cancer treated in a single institution between 2012 and 2017. Per imaging protocol, all the patients underwent planar imaging that detects implanted fiducial markers prior to treatment for inter-fraction motion correction, followed by planar image guidance before each treatment field for intra-fraction motion correction. We identified six patients who experienced CTCAE v4.03 grade >=3 genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity and randomly selected 199 other patients to form a subpopulation for motion analysis. Daily inter- and intra- fractional shift data were obtained to estimate the PTV margins based on the classic van Herk formula. Inter- and intra-fractional motion was compared between patients with severe toxicities and the rest of group as control. Result(s): The inter-fractional margins were estimated to be 0.99, 1.52 and 1.45cm in lateral (LR), longitudinal (SI) and vertical (AP) directions, respectively. To account for intra-fractional motion, the required margins are 0.19, 0.27 and 0.31cm in LR, SI and AP directions, respectively. Large intra-fractional motions were mostly observed in the SI and AP directions with 8.5% and 12.5% of patients experiencing average intra-fractional motion range > 3mm in SI and AP directions, respectively, compared with 1% experiencing shifts >3 mm in the LR direction. No significant differences in inter- or intra-fractional motion was observed between the toxicity and control groups. Conclusion(s): Both inter- and intra-fractional margins estimated from this study are in line with the values reported from conventional fractionated prostate treatment. The intra-fractional prostate motion was generally small with slightly larger margins required for the SI and AP directions. No significant differences in intra- and inter-fractional motions were found between patient experiencing severe toxicity and control patients, affirming the efficacy of the current image guidance protocol and suggesting that other factors such as organ deformation and intrinsic radiosensitivity may contribute to severe toxicity after SBRT.Copyright © 2019",exclusion,Other study design,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.06.788,,,

Hypofractionated SBRT as a boost to conventional ex-ternal beam radiation therapy (EBRT) allows increased radiation dosage with decreased frequency of delivery. This analysis reports on early prostate-cancer-specific quality of life outcomes in patients with localized non-metastatic high risk prostate cancer treated with hypofractionated SBRT boost on a Phase 2 in-house clinical trial. We hypothesize that hypofractionation will increase dose-equivalent delivered to tumor with comparable toxicity profile as measured by quality of life outcomes. Methodology: From September 2011 to November 2015, 12 patients with localized high risk prostate cancer were treated with androgen dep-rivation therapy (ADT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to the pelvis (45 Gy) and hypo-fractionated SBRT boost. Robotic SBRT delivered a total dose of 21 Gy in three fractions. Quality of life was assessed using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26 (EPIC 26) and the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions test (EQ-5D). These parameters were recorded at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 months, 2, 3 and 5 years after treatment. Here, we report on early outcomes of the study at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months after treatment. A two tailed paired t-test was used to compare the data before and after treatment. Result(s): Twelve patients underwent EBRT with hypofractionated SBRT boost. After the first 10 patients treated reached 6 months of follow-up, interim safety analysis revealed no grade 3-5 rectal toxicity. A mean baseline EPIC-26 urinary irritation/obstructive score of 80.2 decreased to 71.4 at 1 month post-treatment (p = 0.19) but returned to baseline with 81.3 at 3 months post-treatment (p = 0.82). At baseline, 25% of men described their urinary function as a moderate to big problem, and that proportion increased to 50% 1 month following completion of SBRT before decreasing to 33.3% at 18 months. Zero percent of men described their bowel function as a moderate to big problem at baseline. The proportion increased to 8.3% 1 month post-treatment before going back to baseline at 18 months. Conclusion(s): Hypofractionated SBRT boost for the treatment of high risk prostate cancer was well tolerated as determined by urinary irritation, incontinence and bowel function and bother. Symptoms were comparable to those observed following traditional EBRT.

The immediate (concomitant) use of ADT in this clinical setting potentially augments the efficacy of SBRT by improving systemic disease control. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of these two treatment strategies. Material(s) and Method(s): Eighty-eight patients with up to three oligometastases and controlled primary disease who had been treated using SBRT with immediate or delayed ADT were included in this retrospective analysis. Progression-free survival (PFS), widespread failure-free survival (WFFS) and freedom from further interventions (FFFI) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard regression methods. Toxicity was evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. Result(s): Thirty-nine patients (44.3%) were treated with SBRT and immediate ADT (continuous ADT, n = 7; intermittent ADT, n = 32) and 49 (55.7%) with SBRT and delayed ADT. The median follow-up was 24 months (interquartile range 13.5-37.0 months). PFS in the immediate and delayed ADT groups were 26 months and 16 months, respectively (P < 0.007). The median WFFS in the immediate ADT group was not reached compared with 21 months in the delayed ADT group (P = 0.025). The 1- and 2-year FFFI in the immediate ADT group were 88% and 64.1%, respectively, significantly higher than those in the delayed ADT group (63.8% and 30.2%, respectively, P < 0.002).

random-journal.pdf,ProP56,"Wang, J",2016,English,pro.p,Combined pretreatment serum testosterone concentration and risk stratification enhances interpretation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics in localized prostate cancer after stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT),"Purpose/Objective(s): The literature suggests that post treatment PSA response differs with risk strata after SBRT. However, questions remain regarding implications to existing risk stratification system. The present study seeks to elucidate whether the conjunction of pre-treatment serum testosterone and the established risk stratification may improve interpretation of PSA after SBRT and adds value in post treatment management. Materials/Methods: 75 patients treated with SBRT for localized prostate cancer at UCLA between 2010 and 2014 were analyzed. Post-treatment PSA was examined at the 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24month follow-up time points. Sixty-seven (89%), and 50 (66%) remained evaluable out to 1 year and 2 years respectively. Baseline testosterone level at 300 ng/dL was used as the cut-off point to stratify patients into low and high subsets. Risk stratification followed the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines. A linear mixed effect model was adopted to examine the PSA kinetics longitudinally. Age and race were adjusted for in the model. To examine the interaction between pretreatment testosterone level and the established risk stratification, a product term was added to the mixed effect model. Result(s): The mean age was 70.5, ranging from 46.5 to 93. There were 31 (41%) patients in the low risk group, and 44 (59%) in the intermediate risk group. There were 32 (43%) patients in the lower testosterone group, and 43 (57%) in the higher testosterone group. No significant difference was found between low and intermediate risk groups on follow-up PSAs. Patients with higher baseline testosterone had higher PSA at 3 and 21 months. In the adjusted mixed effect model, the conjunction of testosterone and risk stratification showed that patients in the intermediate risk group and with higher baseline testosterone had higher PSAs for all of the 9 time points compared to all other patients (Table 1). (Table Presented) Conclusion(s): The present study confirmed the conjunction of testosterone and risk stratification as a significant predictor for PSA kinetics after SBRT. This finding suggests that introducing pre-treatment testosterone to the existing risk predictive model may be useful in clinical management considerations.",exclusion,Other study design,Article on predictive variables of treatment success,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2016.06.1336,,,

In a prospective cohort of men with newly-diagnosed prostate cancer, we compared patient-reported urinary and bowel symptoms from baseline (pre-treatment) to 2 years after brachytherapy, IMRT, and SBRT. Materials/Methods: A population-based cohort of men was enrolled from 2011 to 2013 in collaboration with the North Carolina Cancer Registry using Rapid Case Ascertainment; all patients were enrolled prior to treatment and followed prospectively. Additional men who were to receive SBRT were enrolled in collaboration with several centers across the US. Patient-reported quality of life was assessed using the validated Prostate Cancer Symptom Indices, which includes scales measuring bowel problems, urinary incontinence, and urinary obstruction/irritation. In each scale, patient answers were transformed to a score from 0 (no symptom) to 100 (maximum symptoms). Change score (24 months after treatment minus baseline) were calculated among patients who received each of the 3 radiotherapy modalities; statistical significance of the differences among groups was assessed using ANOVA. Result(s): The Bowel Problem score changed minimally from baseline to 24 months after treatment for all 3 radiotherapy modalities (Table). Urinary incontinence scores increased (worsened) and were not significantly different among the 3 groups (PZ66). Urinary obstruction/irritation outcomes were significantly different across modalities, with worsening after brachytherapy, minimal change (SBRT) or slight improvement (IMRT) at 24 months compared to baseline (P<.001). Conclusion(s): Modern radiation treatment modalities for localized prostate cancer do not cause significant patient-reported bowel problems at 24 months after treatment compared to baseline. Brachytherapy causes more urinary obstruction/irritation symptoms compared to IMRT and SBRT.

PICOS/PRISMA methods were used to identify published English-language comparative studies on PubMed (from 1980 to 2015) that included men treated on prospective studies with a primary endpoint of patient outcomes, with ⩾70 patients, and ⩾5year median follow up. Twenty-six studies met inclusion criteria; of these, 16 used EBRT, and 10 used BT. Long-term freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) rates were roughly equivalent between conventional and hypofractionated RT with intensity modulation (evidence level 1B), with 10-year FFBF rates of 45-90%, 40-60%, and 20-50% (for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively). SBRT had promising rates of BF, with shorter follow-up (5-year FFBF of >90% for low-risk patients). Similarly, BT (5-year FFBF for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients have generally been >85%, 69-97%, 63-80%, respectively) and BT+EBRT were appropriate in select patients (evidence level 1B). Differences in overall survival, distant metastasis, and cancer specific mortality (5-year rates: 82-97%, 1-14%, 0-8%, respectively) have not been detected in randomized trials of dose escalation or in studies comparing RT modalities. Studies did not use patient-reported outcomes, through Grade 3-4 toxicities were rare (<5%) among all modalities. There was limited evidence available to compare proton therapy to other modalities. The treatment decision for a man is usually based on his risk group, ability to tolerate the procedure, convenience for the patient, and the anticipated impact on quality of life. To further personalize therapy, future trials should report (1) race; (2) medical comorbidities; (3) psychiatric comorbidities; (4) insurance status; (5) education status; (6) marital status; (7) income; (8) sexual orientation; and (9) facility-related characteristics.",exclusion,,Incloure com a font per detectar altres estudis randomitzats,PM48,10.1016/j.ctrv.2016.06.006,,,

We assessed plans of SABR with volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) that used a flattening filter (FF) beam and an FFF beam and compared the verification results of dosimetric quality assurance for all pretreatment plans. A total of 20 patients with prostate cancer were enrolled in the study. SABR plans using VMAT with two full arcs were optimized in the Eclipse treatment planning system. All plans prescribed 42.7 Gy in 7 fractions of 6.1 Gy each. Four SABR plans were computed for each patient: two with FF beams and two with FFF beams of 6 and 10 MV. For all plans, the cumulative dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for the target volumes and organs at risk (OARs) were recorded and compared. Pretreatment quality assurance (QA) was performed using the I'mRT MatriXX system and radiochromic EBT3 film to verify treatment delivery, and gamma analysis was used to quantify the agreement between calculations and measurements. In addition, total monitor units (MUs) and delivery time were investigated as technical parameters of delivery. All four plans achieved adequate dose conformity to the target volumes and had comparable dosimetric data. The DVHs of all four plans for each patient were very similar. All plans were highly conformal with CI < 1.05 and CN > 0.90, and the doses were homogeneous (HI = 0.08-0.15). Sparing for the bladder and rectum was slightly better with the 10 MV FF and FFF plans than with the 6 MV FF and FFF plans, but the difference was negligible. However, there was no significant difference in sparing for the other OARs. The mean agreement with the 3%/3 mm criterion was higher than 97% for verifying all plans. For the 2%/2 mm criterion, the corresponding agreement values were more than 90%, which showed that the plans were acceptable. The mean MUs and delivery time used were 1701 ± 101 and 3.02 ± 0.17 min for 6 MV FF, 1870 ± 116 and 2.01 ± 0.01 min for 6 MV FFF, 1471 ± 86 and 2.68 ± 0.14 min for 10 MV FF, and 1619 ± 101 and 2.00 ± 0.00 min for 10MV FFF, respectively. In the current study, the dose distributions of the prostate SABR plans using 6 and 10 MV FFF beams were similar to those using 6 and 10 MV FF beams. However, this study confirmed that SABR treatment using an FFF beam had an advantage with respect to delivery time. In addition, all pretreatment plans were verified as acceptable and their results were comparable. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that the use of an FFF beam for prostate SABR is a feasible and efficient technique, if carefully applied.",exclusion,Not the right comparator,,,10.1120/jacmp.v16i6.5728,,,

Primary endpoint was incidence of SBRT induced late toxicities. Secondary endpoints included various measures of treatment efficacy including cumulative incidence of developing of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and overall survival (OS). Materials/Methods: Synchronous and metachronous metastatic disease presentations were eligible if there were <= 5 metastases, with <= 3 metastases in any single organ system. Conventional scans (CT/bonescan +/- MRI) were used to stage patients at baseline, although novel PET imaging was optional. SBRT was delivered to all sites of disease, including the prostate if not previously treated. SBRT dose was site dependent but was generally 30-35 Gy in 5 fractions for lymph nodes and non-spine bone, 24 Gy in 2 fractions for spine, and 35 Gy in 5 fractions to the prostate. Patients received ADT for 1 year before moving to an intermittent approach. ADT was not to be restarted until the PSA reached >= 10 ng/mL or earlier if clinically indicated. Toxicity (CTCAE v4.0) and PSA measurements were collected every 4 months during follow-up. Conventional scans were performed at a minimum of once per year, although more frequent imaging was allowed at the discretion of the physician. Result(s): 30 patients were accrued with a median age of 74 years. Median follow-up time was 34 months (range 15 - 51). Median baseline PSA was 8.0 ng/mL (range 1.0 - 148.6). 46.7% of patients had Gleason score of 8-10. 9 patients had synchronous disease presentation. Only 3 patients were staged with novel PET imaging. 47 metastases were irradiated, with 36 being in bone. 2 patients developed acute grade 3 GI toxicities. 1 patient developed late grade 3 GU toxicity and 1 patient developed a late SBRT induced bone fracture. There were no grade 4/5 toxicities. Median PSA nadir was 0.03 ng/mL. 46.6% of patients reached a PSA nadir of <= 0.02 ng/mL, while 93% of patients reached a PSA nadir of < 1 ng/mL. The cumulative incidence (CI) of restarting ADT was 47.5% at 3 years. In those who restarted ADT, the median time to the event was 25.8 months. The CI of developing CRPC was 17.2% at 3 years. In those who developed CRPC, the median time to the event was 17.7 months. The CI of local failure of irradiated sites was 10.1% at 3 years. The CI of developing new metastases was 26.3% at 3 years. OS was 89.5% at 3 years. Conclusion(s): The incidence of grade >= 3 toxicity was low when combining SBRT with intermittent ADT in patients with hormone sensitive oligometastatic prostate cancer. Efficacy appears to be promising compared to historical outcomes of using ADT alone, especially with regards to the development of CRPC.

random-journal.pdf,ProP62,"M., Warren",2015,English,pro.m:#5;pro.p:#5,"Computed tomography guided placement of high activity, low dose rate (HALDR) brachytherapy seeds","Objectives: The trend to fewer, high dose per fraction stereotactic treatments for primary and salvage therapy has grown rapidly in the last decade. Modern technologies are capable of delivering sculpted dose with rapid dose fall off, mimicking dose gradients associated with brachytherapy approaches. One approach that is seldom used but holds great promise employs ultra-simple implants using high activity sources. This technique would be well suited for retreatment from the normal tissue standpoint since dose is delivered over months at a low dose rate. Preliminary responses in refractory tumors suggest efficacy and safety, and a vast potential for combination therapy approaches. HALDR approach allows for CT or ultrasound guided implants to be delivered by small gauge needles to any part of the body. Method(s): HALDR brachytherapy is minimally-invasive, less disruptive in side effects, and requires a small time commitment to the procedure. For heavily pretreated solid tumors, seeds placed within the tumor under CT guidance, with an overnight stay for observation is far easier than heroic resections in a prior radiated field. Three clinical examples will be presented. Result(s): Patient 1 is a 54 yo man with prostate cancer post prostatectomy treated with radiation for rising PSA. He later has a bladder neoplasm and under goes cystectomy. A small cell neoplasm of the bladder is found and subsequently treated with chemotherapy. 4 months after completion he develops a small cell metastasis adherent to the pelvic side wall. He is retreated with beam radiation and chemotherapy with a partial response. 4 months later the mass progresses and no further chemotherapeutic options remain. He underwent placement of 3 high activity I-125 sources by CT guidance delivering approximately 5 cGy/hr. He has a partial response by serial CT and continues with stable disease 36 months after implant. Patient 2 was a 50 yo woman with a head and neck sarcoma treated initially with neck dissection and post-operative radiation therapy and chemotherapy. 2 years later there is recurrence treated with partial resection, chemotherapy, and salvage external beam therapy. 1.5 years later she develops two discrete nodules in the neck ranging from 4-5 cm. She undergoes CT guided I-125 high activity seed implant with dramatic response of both lesions. 8 months later, she develops two other recurrences treated with high activity sources and again achieves excellent palliation for 6 months. Patient 3 is a 66 year old male with a pancreatic tail adenocarcinoma who had a PET CT that showed an SUV of 10.5. After treatment with chemotherapy he had minimal change in the size of the neoplasm and underwent CT guided placement of two external beam markers and two I-125 seeds (22.9 cGycm2/hr for a total of 103 Gy). 19 days later a repeat PET CT demonstrated that the lesion had decreased in size and now had an SUV of 4.4. Conclusion(s): CT guided placement of HALDR brachytherapy is a promising backup and alternative to hypofractionated SBRT approaches for salvage of refractory local ized solid tumors. In preliminary reports and experience such low dose rate therapy has been well tolerated even in patients treated with initial full dose with external beam and SBRT salvage, confirming the normal tissue sparing effects of low dose rate implants. Since most practitioners may employ this in very limited number of patients, an international registry may be necessary to further define the potential of this approach in anticipation of prospective trials.",exclusion,Not dealing with intervention of interest,,PM52,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2015.03.007,,,

The term oligometastases describes an intermediate metastatic state, in which cancer exists as a limited number of metastases at first, before cells acquire the ability to metastasise more widely. For the large majority of solid cancers, once metastatic disease has been diagnosed the chances of cure are small. There are several situations where this is not the case, but it is not known if stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for oligometastatic disease will alter outcomes or whether the toxicity burden of this treatment is justified. SBRT is targeted radiotherapy which destroys cancer cells in the area of the body it is aimed at however low dose radiation may be received by surrounding tissue.
random-journal.pdf,It is difficult to quantify incidence of patients with multiple primary cancers developing at intervals that are representative of oligometastatic stage IV disease, (defined for the purposes of this trial as ≤ 3 metastatic sites). However an increase in the use of surveillance imaging, together with improved diagnostic sensitivity has led to the diagnosis of patients with asymptomatic oligometastatic relapse becoming a more common clinical occurrence. The CORE study is a randomized controlled trial that will be conducted in patients with cancer in one of three primary sites where oligometastatic disease relapse is a common clinical scenario: breast, prostate and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study will evaluate the use of SBRT in this patient population.

METHODS: Patients received radical radiotherapy as either 33.5 Gy/5 fr for SBRT or 75.6 Gy/35 fr for VMAT. International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Prostate Cancer Module (QLQ-PR25) forms were used to assess QOL. RESULTS: Of the 48 patients (28 in SBRT and 20 in VMAT) included in the study, 40 (20 in SBRT and 20 in VMAT) were evaluated for QOL status. PSA control rate was 100% and PSA nadir value was 0.5 ng/dl in both arms during the median follow-up period of 23 months. The magnitude of PSA bounce was higher in the SBRT arm than in the VMAT arm (P = 0.01). The PSA decline rate in the VMAT arm was higher than in the SBRT arm (P = 0.028).

A lack of randomised data limits interpretation preventing evaluation of the true benefit of adding SBRT to systemic therapy. The potential therapeutic benefit of adding SBRT to standard therapy may vary between tumour sites and there is insufficient evidence currently to predict which cancers may benefit most from such an approach. CORE will investigate whether the addition of SBRT to standard therapy improves survival outcomes, focusing on common primary tumour sites where oligometastatic disease is encountered (Breast, prostate and NSCLC). CORE will aim to demonstrate: Feasibility of recruitment; Deliverability of the study in a multi-centre setting; Activity of SBRT based on progression free survival across three tumour types. Method(s): CORE is a CRUK funded, phase II/III multi-centre, nonblinded, randomised controlled trial in patients with breast, prostate or NSCLC primary cancer comparing standard of care (SOC) with or without SBRT for extra-cranial metastases. Eligible patients will have either primary breast, prostate or NSCLC presenting with <= 3 extra-cranial, metachronous, oligometastases all suitable for SBRT. Patients randomised 1:1 to either SOC or SOC + SBRT. Choice of SOC at local clinician's discretion, defined prior to randomisation. Patients randomised to SBRT+SOC will receive dose and fractionation regimen dependent on metastatic site and proximity to critical normal tissues. Treatment will occur within 6 weeks of randomisation. All patients will be reviewed every 3 months with clinical examination and tumour markers (where applicable) during years 1 and 2 and 6 monthly thereafter to 5 years.

Over a third of prostate cancer (PCa) patients treated with radical prostatectomy and postoperative radiotherapy experience disease recurrence; these patients are considered incurable by current standards. Often the recurrence cannot be localised by conventional imaging (CT and bone scan). Combined anatomical imaging with CT and/or MR with positron emission tomography (PET) using a novel second-generation prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) probe, [ 18 F]DCFPyL, is a promising imaging modality to unveil disease deposits in these patients. A new and earlier molecularly defined oligorecurrent (OR) state may be amenable to focal-targeted ablative curative-intent therapies, such as stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) or surgery, thereby significantly delaying or completely avoiding the need for palliative therapies in men with recurrent PCa after maximal local treatments. Methods and analysis This ongoing single-institution phase II study will enrol up to 75 patients total, to include up to 37 patients with response-evaluable disease, who have rising prostate-specific antigen (range 0.4-3.0 ng/mL) following maximal local therapies with no evidence of disease on conventional imaging. These patients will undergo [ 18 F]DCFPyL PET-MR/CT imaging to detect disease deposits, which will then be treated with SABR or surgery. The primary endpoints are performance of [ 18 F]DCFPyL PET-MR/CT, and treatment response rates following SABR or surgery. Demographics and disease characteristics will be summarised and analysed descriptively. Response rates will be described with waterfall plots and proportions. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was obtained from the institutional Research Ethics Board. All patients will provide written informed consent. [ 18 F]DCFPyL has approval from Health Canada.

Recent randomized trials have also demonstrated benefit from combination docetaxel with ADT for men with naive metastatic prostate cancer. The use of local consolidative treatment in conjunction with neoadjuvant chemo-hormonal therapy in this setting, however, has not previously been described. We present the initial surgical outcomes of a novel protocol. Material(s) and Method(s): A phase II study conducted at our institution began accruing patients in 2016. Men with newly-diagnosed synchronous oligometastatic prostate cancer (T1-4, N0-1, M1a-b) consisting of <=5 metastatic lesions were treated with the following therapies: (1st) systemic chemo-hormonal therapy with up to 6 months of neoadjuvant ADT and up to 6 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy, (2nd) consolidation with radical prostatectomy (RP) +/- adjuvant radiation therapy (XRT), and (3rd) stereotactic radiation (SBRT) to oligometastatic lesions. Patients who underwent prior therapy for localized prostate cancer or to a metastatic site, or who received prior systemic therapy, were excluded. Surgical outcomes and complications were evaluated. Result(s): To date, 28 patients have enrolled in the study and 14 have undergone RP. For men undergoing surgery, median age was 60 years with median follow-up of 7 months. Patients had a median 2.5 sites of metastases (range, 1-5) and PSA 13.5 (range, 3.6-953) at diagnosis. All patients received 6 months of ADT and 6 cycles of Docetaxel; median PSA following systemic therapy was 0.4 (range, <0.1-5.1). Median operative time, blood loss, and length of hospitalization were 181 min (range, 116-230), 275 ml (range 100-1,800), and 1 day (range 1-3), respectively. Seven patients underwent open and seven underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with a 7.1% peri-operative transfusion rate (1 patient) in the open group and none in the robotic group. One patient (7.1%) experienced a Clavien grade II complication (hematuria). The majority of men (10 patients, 71.4%) had >=ypT3a disease and 7 (50%) had positive surgical margins.

RESULT(S): To date, 18 patients have enrolled in the study: 17 have undergone RP and 1 is currently receiving neoadjuvant systemic therapy. For men undergoing surgery, median age was 58.0 years (IQR 55.0-64.0) with median follow-up of 10.1 months (IQR 4.1-13.2).

METHODS: The (a) and (b) arms investigated primary and metastatic lung cancer differentiated by site of onset, arm (c) included primary or metastatic lesions outside the thorax, the (d) and (e) arms were for in-field reirradiation of recurrence, and finally, the (f) and (g) arms were for boost irradiation to the lesions after an adjuvant RT prescribed dose. A 4 months cut-off after previous irradiation course was fixed to distinguish the boost from the retreatment (<4 vs >4 months, respectively). Patients were prospectively enrolled in study arms according to tumor site, clinical stage and previous treatment. The total dose prescribed to the isocenter, ranged from 20 to 50 Gy according to the protocol design and the doses per fraction ranged from 4 to 10 Gy in 5 days. RESULTS: A total of 281 patients (M/F: 167/114; median age: 69 years) with 376 lesions underwent SBRT. No acute toxicity was reported in 175 patients (62.3%) while 106 (37.7%) experienced only low-grade (G < 2) acute toxicity. Four patients (all previously irradiated in the same site) showed >Grade 2 toxicity within 6 months from SBRT. With a median follow-up of 19 months, 204 patients (72.6%) did not experience late toxicity, and 77 (27.4%) experienced low grade late toxicity. On per-lesion basis, the 12-and 24 months actuarial local control inside the SBRT field were 84.3 and 73.7 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: SBRT delivered in five consecutive fractions up to the doses evaluated is well tolerated. The MTD was reached in four (a, b, c and f) of the seven study arms. Recruitment for (d), (e) and (g) arms is still ongoing.

Method(s): Two sequential phase I/II studies of 5-fraction SABR for the treatment of low and intermediate risk (LR and IR) prostate cancer have been conducted. In the first trial, 84 LR patients(pts) received 35 Gy in 5 fractions, once per week over 29 days (Group 1). In the second trial, 30 pts (18 LR, 11 IR) received 40 Gy in 5 fractions, once per week over 29 days (Group 2). Treatment was delivered to the prostate with intensity modulated radiotherapy using daily image guidance and a 4mm (Group 1) or 5 mm (Group 2) CTV-PTV margin. PSA nadir and bRFS(nadir+2 definition) were compared between the two groups. Acute (CTCv3.0), late (RTOG) and cumulative toxicity for late grade >=2 GU/GI toxicities were also compared. Result(s): Median follow up was 74 (IQR 67-81) and 36 (IQR 32-39) months. Median PSA nadir was 0.4 ng/ml and 0.3 ng/ml. Time to PSA nadir was 54 and 32.5 months. 44.0% in group 1 and 30% in Group 2 experienced benign PSA bounce. There were 3 and 0 PSA failures in Groups 1 and 2. 2-, 4-and 6-year bRFS was 100%, 98.7% and 95.9% and 100%, 100% and not reached in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p=0.91). The only acute grade 3 toxicity was noticed in Group 1 (1 pt, GU). Late grade 4 GI toxicity was noted in Group 1 (1 pt, GI, fistula). Up to 4 years of follow-up, Group 2 pts have had a greater percentage of grade 2+ cumulative GU (5.0% vs 24.2%) and GI (7.6% vs 26.2%) toxicities. Conclusion(s): Pts receiving a dose escalated SABR had slightly lower PSA nadir and similar bRFS - longer follow up is needed to better estimate biochemical outcomes in Group 2.

This study compares long-term quality of life (QOL) from two prospective trials of prostate SBRT to investigate the effect of increasing dose (NCT01578902 and NCT01146340). Material(s) and Method(s): Patients with localized prostate cancer received SBRT 35 or 40 Gy delivered in five fractions, once per week. QOL was measured using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite at baseline and every 6 months. Fisher's exact test and generalized estimating equations were used to analyze proportions of patients with clinically significant change and longitudinal changes in QOL. Result(s): One hundred fourteen patients were included, 84 treated with 35 Gy and 30 treated with 40 Gy. Median QOL follow-up was 56 months [interquartile range (IQR) 46-60] and 38 months (IQR 32-42), respectively.

Method(s): This study included 8 patients with localized prostate cancer. Dosimetric assets of 4 delivery techniques for stereotactic body radiotherapy were evaluated: robotic CyberKnife, noncoplanar intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and 2 intensity-modulated arc therapy techniques (RapidArc and Elekta volumetric-modulated arc therapy). All the plans had equal treatment margins and a prescription dose of 35 Gy in 5 fractions. Result(s): Statistically significant differences were observed in homogeneity index and mean doses of bladder wall and penile bulb, all of which were highest with CyberKnife. No significant differences were observed in the mean doses of rectum, with values of 15.2 +/- 2.6, 13.3 +/- 2.6, 13.1 +/- 2.8, and 13.8 +/- 1.6 Gy with CyberKnife, RapidArc, volumetric-modulated arc therapy, and noncoplanar intensity-modulated radiotherapy, respectively. The highest dose conformity was realized with RapidArc. The dose coverage of the planning target volume was lowest with noncoplanar intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Treatment times and number of monitor units were largest with CyberKnife (on average 34.0 +/- 5.0 minutes and 8704 +/- 1449 monitor units) and least with intensity-modulated arc therapy techniques (on average 5.1 +/- 1.1 minutes and 2270 +/- 497 monitor units). Conclusion(s): Compared to CyberKnife, the RapidArc, volumetric-modulated arc therapy, and noncoplanar intensity-modulated radiotherapy produced treatment plans with similar dosimetric quality, with RapidArc achieving the highest dose conformity. Overall, the dosimetric differences between the studied techniques were marginal, and thus, the choice of the technique should rather focus on the delivery accuracies and dose delivery times.Copyright © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1533034616682156,,,

The goal of this study was to evaluate correlations between short-term QOL outcomes and dosimetric parameters to guide future prostate SBRT planning. Methods and materials: From 2010 to 2013, QOL data were prospectively collected from 75 patients enrolled in a prostate SBRT clinical trial. A comparison was made between Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite scores for patients with the top 25th percentile versus the bottom 75th percentile of the following dose-volume histogram parameters: planning target volume V100; bladder V50 and V100; and rectum V50, V80, V90, and V100. A linear mixed-effect model was used to estimate the difference between the 2 strata for each parameter. Result(s): Median follow-up was 12 months. Patients with planning target volume V100 volumes >120 cm3 had the worst reduction in urinary QOL. Urinary QOL was also decreased significantly in patients with bladder V100 volumes >5.5 cm3. Bowel QOL was decreased significantly in patients with rectal V90 and V100 volumes >4.2 and >1.5 cm3, respectively. Conclusion(s): Patients with large prostate size or large volumes of rectum and bladder that receive >=. 90% of the prescribed radiation dose are more susceptible to short-term QOL decrements after prostate SBRT.

Here we report the dosimetric predictors of late toxicity and quality of life (QOL) in a pooled cohort of patients from four phase II trials. Method(s): The combined cohort included all three prostate cancer risk groups. The prescription dose was 35-40 Gy in 5 fractions. Toxicity (CTCAE) and QOL (EPIC) were collected. Multiple dosimetric parameters for the bladder, rectum and penile bulb were collected. Univariate (UVA) followed by multivariate (MVA) logistic regression analysis was conducted to search for significant dosimetric predictors of late GI/GU toxicity, or minimal clinically important change in the relevant QOL domain. Result(s): 258 patients were included with median follow up of 6.1 years. For QOL, bladder Dmax, V38, D1cc, D2cc, D5cc and rectal V35 were predictors of urinary and bowel MCIC on UVA. On MVA, only bladder V38 remained significant. For late toxicity, various parameters were significant on UVA but only rectal Dmax, V38 and bladder D2cc were significant predictors on MVA. Conclusion(s): This report confirms that the high-dose regions in the bladder and rectum are more significant predictors of late toxicity and QOL after prostate SABR compared to low-dose regions.

We now report prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics following high-dose SBRT in patients treated with radiation alone. Methods and materials Ninety-one patients were enrolled on the phase 1/2 dose escalation study of SBRT for localized prostate cancer. All patients with at least 36 months of follow-up and without hormone therapy were included in this analysis (n = 47). Treatment response parameters evaluated include time to nadir, nadir value, occurrence of PSA bounces (rise of >=0.2 ng/mL followed by a subsequent fall), magnitude of bounces, duration of bounces, and correlation of bounces with clinical outcomes. Results Median follow-up was 42 months (range, 36-78 months). Treatment dose levels were 45 Gy (n = 10), 47.5 Gy (n = 8), and 50 Gy (n = 29) in 5 fractions. Biochemical control rate was 98%. Median PSA at follow-up was 0.10 +/- 0.20 ng/mL. Median time to nadir was 36 +/- 11 months. A total of 24/47 (51.1%) patients had >=1 PSA bounce. Median magnitude of PSA rise during bounce was 0.50 +/- 1.2 ng/mL. Median time to first bounce was 9 +/- 7.0 months. Median bounce duration was 3 +/- 2.3 months for the first bounce and 6 +/- 5.2 months for subsequent bounces. Prostate volumes <30 mL were associated with a decreased likelihood of bounce (P =.0202), and increasing prostate volume correlated with increasingly likelihood of having >=2 bounces (P =.027). Patients reaching PSA nadir of <=0.1 ng/mL were less likely to experience any bounce (P =.0044). Conclusions Compared with other SBRT experiences, our study demonstrated a higher PSA bounce rate, a similar or shorter median time to bounce, and a very low nadir.

Objective(s): To evaluate tolerance and tumor control outcomes in low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients treated with high-dose SBRT following our phase 1 trial. Design, setting, and participants: A total of 551 patients with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer were treated with SBRT. Intervention(s): Treatment with 37.5-40 Gy SBRT in five fractions directed to the prostate and seminal vesicles. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Outcome measurements included acute toxicities (<3 mo after radiotherapy [RT]) and late toxicities (>3 mo after RT) and tumor control evaluation (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] levels at 3-6-mo intervals and post-treatment prostate biopsy at 2 yr). Results and limitations: Acute grade 2 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities occurred in 1.8% of patients, and late grade 2 and 3 GI toxicities were observed in 3.4% and 0.4% of patients, respectively. Acute grade 2 genitourinary (GU) toxicities occurred in 10% of patients, and grade 3 acute GU toxicities were observed in 0.7% of patients. Late grade 2 and 3 GU toxicities were observed in 21.1% and 2.5% of patients, respectively. The use of a hydrogel rectal spacer was significantly associated with reduced late GI toxicity and lower odds of developing late GU toxicity. The median follow-up was 17 mo, and 53% of those with at least 2 yr of follow-up (103/193) had a biopsy performed. The 5-yr cumulative incidence of PSA failure was 2.1%, and the incidence of a positive 2-yr treatment biopsy was 12%. Limitations to this report include its retrospective nature and short follow-up time. Conclusion(s): Favorable short-term outcomes were achieved with high-dose SBRT for low- and intermediate-risk disease. Severe late toxicities were observed and favorable tumor control was found.

Fortunately, with the development of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), treatment of lung cancer usher in a new era, resulting in a hit of precise therapy and molecule sequencing. However, it is inevitable for patients to gain acquired resistance of EGFR TKI. Several studies have been demonstrated that there were approximately 30% heterogeneous cells in primary tumors. And emerging studies illuminated that main pattern of treatment failure was the recurrence of primary site. Moreover, it was proved that despite of the drug‐resistance cells in progressive site, continual prescription of EGFR TKI in oligometastasis lung cancer could make a difference for patients in progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), owing to the residual responsive cells in another sites. Therefore, to explore an unique method to control heterogeneous cells in primary site so as to delay or prevent acquired resistance when taking EGFR TKI orally may be of great benefit and therapy. It is known to all that stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), with the advantage of hypofractionation and rapid release, succeed in several cancers, such as early lung cancer, prostatic, liver cancer and so on, for local control. Numerous reports explained SBRT played an irreplaceable role in progressive NSCLC patients after oral targeted medicine, regardless of EGFR or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutation. And the radiosensitivity of EGFR TKI in vitro and vivo may account for these inspiring results. What's more, it has reported that SBRT could induce inflammatory cell death, activate dendritic cell as well as accelerate antigen presentation in the draining lymph node, leading to antigen‐specific adaptive immune response. Nevertheless, although the potential effects of SBRT on advanced NSCLC are obviously, few studies explore the preventive benefits of early SBRT combined with oral EGFR TKI on advanced lung cancer by eliminating the heterogeneous cells in primary site. In addition, the investigators' previous phase II study of SBRT combined with oral EGFR TKI had revealed its safety and potentially improvement of PFS for 6 months. In this trial, the investigators put sight into assessing the efficacy of early application of SBRT to primary site in the advanced NSCLC patients and provide a hypothesis that early SBRT could strengthen the anti‐tumor effect of EGFR TKI through eradicating the heterogenity of initial tumor cells.",exclusion,Other tumor treated (lung),,PM69,,,,

METHODS: Inclusion criteria of the present multicentre retrospective analysis were: (1) oligorecurrent PC, defined as the presence of 1-3 lesions (bone or nodes) detected with choline positron emission tomography or CT plus bone scan following biochemical recurrence; (2) oligo-CRPC, defined as metastases (bone or nodes) detected after a prostatic-specific antigen rise during androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Primary end points were: distant progression-free survival (DPFS) and ADT-free survival in oligorecurrent PC patients; DPFS and second-line systemic treatment-free survival in oligo-CRPC patients. RESULTS: About 100 patients with oligorecurrent PC (139 lesions) and 41 with oligo-CRPC (70 lesions), treated between March 2010 and April 2016, were analysed. After a median follow-up of 20.4 months, in the oligorecurrent group 1- and 2-year DPFS were 64.4 and 43%. The rate of LC was 92.8% at 2 years. At a median follow-up of 23.4 months, in the oligo-CRPC group 1- and 2-year DPFS were 43.2 and 21.6%. Limitations include the retrospective design.

Both stereotactic body RT (SBRT) and elective pelvic nodal RT (ENRT) have been used in this setting and are considered valid, even if still investigational treatment options. However, the best way to irradiate patients with an exclusive oligometastatic nodal disease remains debated. Most subsequent relapses after only SBRT for nodal recurrences are nodal and oligometastatic. The concept of spatial cooperation between SBRT and ENRT is also attractive in this kind of clinical scenario. Hence, in this area we present our preliminary results in terms of early outcomes and toxicity data combining ENRT and SBRT on the pelvic nodal relapses after primary treatment for PCa. Material(s) and Method(s): From April 2017 to March 2018, 12 patients with 15 isolated lymph nodes of recurrent prostate cancer were treated combining ENRT with SBRT on pelvic nodal relapses in single-institution retrospective study of the University Hospital of Udine (ASUIUD). Patient features are summarized in Table I. All patients underwent Choline-PET or PSMA PET/ CT to assess local failure. The prophylactic lymph nodal delineations followed the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) guidelines. A three-dimensional volumetric margin of 5 mm was grown all around the prophylactic and gross nodal clinical target volume to generate the respective nodal PTV. A SIB schema was designed to deliver 54 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction) to the pelvic lymph nodals, and 60 Gy (2 Gy/fraction) to the positive nodals. The SBRT treatment was designed to deliver in one session 10 Gy to the positive nodes. The delivery techniques employed were IMRT and VMAT. The main focus planning was achieving good target coverage (V95>=95) with optimal organ sparing. For organs at risk, the dose constraints used are derived from QUANTEC Neoadjuvant ADT was administered for to all patients for a median time of 3 months. Routine institutional image-based patient position verification protocols foresaw daily on-line matching by CBCT. The acute and late toxicities were recorded using the RTOG/EORTC scale. Restaging with TC/PET was performed 3 months after the end of treatment. Result(s): The median follow-up duration was 6 months (range=3-12 months). The median age was 70 years (range=61-78 years). The median time from primary cancer treatment to ENRT combined with SBRT was 3.4 years (range=2.4-7.9 years) with a primary Gleason score of >= 8 in 4 patients. All patients were treated to pelvic nodal site. One and two oligometastatic lesions were treated in 75% and 25% of patients, respectively. Median PSA values at the time of the Choline-PET and PSMA PET/ CT were 1.16 ng/ml and 0.59 ng/ml, respectively. All patients completed the prescribed radiation treatment, with no interruption. Acute GU toxicity of grade 1 (increase in urinary frequency) was observed in one patient. The incidence of acute GI and GU toxicity of any grade were 14.2% and 35.7%, respectively. No acute and late toxicity >=2 was noted. Biochemical response seems to be complete at 3 months and 10 patients underwent a restaging with TC/PET 3-6 months after the end of treatment with complete metabolic response. Conclusion(s): Combined treatment modalities are safe in the treatment of nodal metacrochronous oligometastatic castration-naive prostate cancer after primary treatment of PCa. These results may provide a basis for a larger phase II study to examine the role of the elective pelvic nodal irradiation combined with focal nodal SBRT in this population currently treated only with focal nodal SBRT.

However, concerns exist regarding the impact of SBRT on erectile function given the large dose per fraction. Using validated prospective models of erectile function for brachytherapy (BT), conventional radiotherapy (EBRT), and nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (RP), erectile function rates are compared to a prospective cohort of SBRT treated men. Purpose/Objective(s): Between 2008 and 2013, 373 patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with prostate SBRT (35-36.25 Gy in 5 fractions) per an institutional protocol. No men received androgen deprivation therapy. Prospective health-related quality of life (HRQOL) data were collected via the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)-26. Erectile function (EF) was defined as ""firm enough for intercourse"". Individual patient data from the SBRT cohort was entered into the three validated models (EBRT, BT, and RP) from the Prostate Cancer Outcomes and Satisfaction with Treatment Quality Assessment (PROSTQA) multicenter study (JAMA 2011), which adjusted as indicated for patient age, HRQOL, BMI, race, and PSA. Observed and model-expected EF rates were compared. Result(s): The median age was 69, and 33%, 62%, and 4% were low, intermediate and high risk, respectively. Baseline EF was 49%. At 2 years, 84% of patients had follow up with complete HRQOL. Of those, 50% had EF at baseline, and two years post-treatment, 34% had EF (95% CI 29-40%). EF 2-years post-SBRT did not significantly differ from model predicted 2 year rates of erectile function following EBRT (37%, 95% CI 33-40%, p=0.31) or BT (32%, 95% CI 28-35%, p=0.29). EF following SBRT was significantly improved compared to expected rates following RP (16%, 95% CI 15-18%, p<0.01). When restricting analysis to patients with baseline HRQOL 60-100, EF at baseline was 88% and 2-years post-SBRT was 57% (95% CI 49-64%). This did not significantly differ from 2 year expected rates following EBRT (61%, 95% CI 59-64%, p=0.21) or BT (58%, 55-62%, p=0.37), but was improved compared to RP (29%, 95% CI 27-32%, p<0.01). Conclusion(s): Observed EF rates after SBRT are comparable to model-expected rates of EF from other radiation modalities. Furthermore, nerve-sparing RP appeared to result in half the rate of EF 2 years post-treatment compared to radiotherapeutic modalities. Ongoing randomized trials, such as Prostate Advances in Comparative Evidence (PACE) that is comparing SBRT, EBRT, and RP, will provide additional key information to this important question.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2008 and 2013, 373 consecutive men with localized prostate cancer were treated with SBRT at a single academic institution as part of a prospective clinical trial or prospective registry. Prospective longitudinal patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data was collected using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)-26 instrument. Functional erections were strictly defined as 'firm enough for intercourse' according to EPIC-26. Detailed comorbidity data were also collected. Logistic regression models were used to predict 24- and 60-month functional erection rates. Observed erection rates after SBRT were compared with those after other radiation therapies (external beam radiation therapy [EBRT] and brachytherapy) using prospectively validated models. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) follow-up was 56 (37-73) months and the response rate at 2 years was 84%. For those with functional erections at baseline, 57% and 45% retained function at 24 and 60 months, respectively. On multivariable analysis for 24-month erectile function, significant variables included higher baseline sexual HRQoL (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.55 per 10 points, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37-1.74; P < 0.001) and older age (aOR 0.66 per 10 years, 95% CI 0.43-1.00; P = 0.05).

The 24- and 60-month models had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.81 and 0.84, respectively). Erection rates after SBRT were not statistically different from model-predicted rates after EBRT or brachytherapy for the whole cohort and the cohort with baseline erectile function.

random-journal.pdf,ProP86,"M., O'Shaughnessy",2017,English,pro.p:#5,Evaluation of a multimodal strategy to accelerate drug evaluations in early-stage metastatic prostate cancer,"Background: The paradigm of first testing systemic treatments in advanced disease followed by development in earlier disease states and finally large-scale trials evaluating whether the approach, in combination with local therapy, can prevent or delay the time-to-event measures of disease progression or death in patients with ""high-risk"" tumors is no longer practical now that 6 life-prolonging systemic therapies in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer are available. New strategies are needed to rapidly evaluate and prioritize regimens for large-scale phase 3 testing. Method(s): We conducted a pilot study of twenty men with oligometastatic M1a (extrapelvic nodal disease) or M1b (bone disease) at diagnosis. All sites of disease were treated using a multimodal approach that included androgen deprivation (ADT), radical prostatectomy plus pelvic lymphadenectomy (retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy in the presence of clinically positive retroperitoneal nodes), and stereotactic body radiotherapy to osseous disease and/or the primary site. ADT was discontinued in responding patients. Outcomes of each treatment were assessed sequentially. The primary endpoint of ""no evidence of disease"" (NED) was defined by an undetectable PSA with noncastrate levels of testosterone at 20 months. Result(s): Each treatment modality contributed to the outcome: 95% of the cohort achieved an undetectable PSA with multimodal treatment, including 25% of patients after ADT alone and an additional 50% and 20% after surgery and radiotherapy, respectively. Overall, 20% of patients (95% confidence interval 3- 38%) achieved the primary endpoint, which persisted for 5, 6, 27+, and 46+ months. All patients meeting the primary endpoint had been classified with M1b disease at presentation. Conclusion(s): Treatment directed at all sites can eliminate detectable disease in selected patients with metastatic prostate cancer. A multimodal treatment strategy inclusive of the NED endpoint for patients who present with disease that is beyond the limits of curability by any single modality should be considered to enable the evaluation of new approaches in order to prioritize large-scale testing in early stages of advanced disease.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,,,,

We evaluated treatment regret and patients' perceptions of their treatment experiences to better inform our understanding of a treatment's value. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with localized prostate cancer treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), or high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy between 2008 and 2014 with at least 1 year of follow-up were surveyed. The questionnaire explored the decision-making experience, expectations of toxicities versus the reality, and treatment regret by means of a validated tool. RESULTS: Three hundred twenty-nine consecutive patients were surveyed, with an 86% response rate (IMRT, n=74; SBRT, n=108; HDR, n=94). The median patient age and posttreatment follow-up time were 68 years and 47 months, respectively. Eighty-two percent of patients had T1c disease with either Gleason 6 (42%) or Gleason 7 (58%) pathologic features and a median initial prostate-specific antigen of 5.8 ng/mL. Thirteen percent expressed regret with their treatment. Among patients with regret, 71% now wish they had elected for active surveillance. The incidence of regret was significantly different between treatment modalities: 5% of patients treated with SBRT expressed regret versus 18% with HDR and 19% with IMRT (P<.01). On multivariable logistic regression, patients treated with HDR versus SBRT were 7.42 times more likely to have regret, and patients treated with IMRT versus SBRT were 11.11 times more likely to have regret (P<.01 and P<.01, respectively). Significantly more patients treated with SBRT selected that their actual long-term toxicities were significantly less than originally expected, compared with IMRT and HDR patients (SBRT 43% vs IMRT 20% vs HDR 10%, P<.01). CONCLUSIONS: We found significant differences in patients' experiences between SBRT, IMRT, and HDR, with significantly less treatment regret and less toxicity than expected among SBRT patients.

The interest in this technique is based on the favourable radiobiological characteristics of prostate cancer and supported by advantageous logistic aspects deriving from short overall treatment time. The clinical validity of short-term treatment schedule is proven by a body of non-randomised studies, using both isocentric (LINAC-based) or non-isocentric (CyberKnife(®)-based) stereotactic body irradiation techniques. Twenty clinical studies, each enrolling more than 40 patients for a total of 1874 treated patients, were revised in terms of technological setting, toxicity, outcome and quality of life assessment. The implemented strategies for the tracking of the prostate and the sparing of the rectal wall have been investigated with particular attention. The urinary toxicity after prostate stereotactic body irradiation seems slightly more pronounced as compared to rectal adverse events, and this is more evident for late occurring events, but no worse as respect to conventional fractionation schemes. As far as the rate of severe acute toxicity is concerned, in all the available studies the treatment was globally well tolerated. While awaiting long-term data on efficacy and toxicity, the analysed studies suggest that the outcome profile of this approach, alongside the patient convenience and reduced costs, is promising.

Literature data indicating that this is the case for a moderately hypofractionated regimen was first reported from Italy by Arcangeli. This study was however quite small. At ECC 2015 Dearnaley presented the results from the UK threearmed CHHiP-trial comprising 3,200 patients. This threearmed trial showed non-inferiority between the 74 Gy conventional arm (37 fr; 2 Gy/fr) and the 60 Gy moderately hypofractionated arms (20 fr; 3 Gy/fr) while the experimental arm given 57 Gy arm (19 fr; 3Gy/fr.) had lower efficacy. Patients had predominately intermediate risk tumours and most patients received 6 month of neoadjuvant and concomitant castration treatment. Previously published toxicity data from the trial showed similar results for the trial arms. Results from other moderately hypofractionated schedules have also been reported recently. RTOG 0415 with only low-risk patients, showed that 70 Gy in 28 fr over 5.6 weeks is non-inferior to 73.8 Gy in 41 fr over 8.2 weeks for low risk PCa patients.

In the experimental arm, MR-guided de-escalation is performed within prostate adjacent to one neurovascular bundle (NVB). In this dosimetric pilot study, we assess the ability to salvage failures in the spared prostate with focal HDR brachytherapy. Materials/Methods: Three prostate cancer patients treated with combination HDR/EBRT unrelated to the protocol were used for modeling since they had both MR/CT with rectal spacer simulation and transrectal ultrasound images (TRUS) with modified peripheral loading needle placement. For the theoretical neurovascular-sparing plans, two PTVs were created: PTV30 (30Gy/5fx) = prostate + 3mm excluding NVB; PTV45 (45Gy/5fx) = PTV30 minus a 5mm avoidance on one side's neurovascular elements (contralateral to disease). Diffuse or focal (apical, mid, or base) failures in the spared area of prostate receiving <= 30Gy were modeled for salvage. PTV for salvage was defined as (GTV + 5mm) + (all initially spared prostate + 3mm) and restricted to gland and covered to 27Gy/2fx using only the already present needle locations on TRUS images. Constraints were based on existing HDR salvage protocols and included urethra D100% < 110% and rectal V80% < 0.2mL. Result(s): Coverage for simulated failures was maintained without sacrificing organ at risk (OAR) constraints. Urethral doses were highest in diffuse and focal base failures, but were within pre-specified constraints. Conclusion(s): We demonstrate that salvage brachytherapy after neurovascular-sparing SAbR is feasible and does not compromise target coverage or OAR constraints. While salvage after SAbR is not well described, this protocol establishes a realistic model for salvage HDR in the setting of anatomy-driven de-escalation in prostate cancer radiotherapy.

We hypothesized that dose-escalated SBRT could be safely administered across multiple institutions, with grade 3+ toxicities not exceeding 10%. With median follow up greater than five years, we report toxicity, survival, and relapse-free survival (RFS) outcomes. Materials/Methods: After completing rigorous credentialing requirements, 21 community, regional, and academic hospitals enrolled 309 evaluable patients with biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate, confirmed by central pathologic review: 172 low-risk (CS T1-T2a, Gleason 6, PSA < 10 ng/mL) and 137 intermediate-risk (CS T1c-T2b with either GleasonZ7 and PSA < 10 ng/mL, or Gleason 6 and PSA between 10 and 20 ng/mL). All patients were treated with a non-isocentric robotic SBRT platform using real-time tracking of implanted fiducials. The prostate was prescribed 40 Gy in 5 fractions of 8 Gy and seminal vesicles received 36.25 Gy. Normal tissues were rigidly constrained (rectal V36 Gy <1 cc; bladder V37 Gy <5-10 cc). No patient had concomitant or adjuvant androgen ablation therapy. Toxicities were assessed using CTCAE v3 criteria. Patient-reported quality of life outcomes were recorded and reported elsewhere. Biochemical failure was assessed using the ASTRO consensus and the nadir + 2 definitions. Actuarial survival outcomes were calculated using Kaplan Meier methods. The study populations yielded a 90% power of identifying excessive (>10%) rates of grade 3+ GU or GI toxicities at the one-sided 5% significance level. Result(s): Median follow-up was 61 months. Five grade 3+ toxicities (1.6%) were reported, far below the 10% rate deemed excessive. There were no grade 4 or 5 toxicities. All reported grade 3 toxicities were GU; these occurred between 11 and 51 months after treatment. Toxicities rates are summarized below. Five patients (1.6%) developed urinary retention which required a temporary catheter placement. Seven patients were diagnosed with bladder cancers between 21 and 50 months after treatment. For the entire population, actuarial 5-year overall survival was 95.6%. Actuarial 5-year nadir +2 RFS was 97.1% for all patients, and was 97.3% and 97.1% for the low-and intermediate-risk groups, respectively. Actuarial 5-year ASTRO RFS was 92.3% and 91.3% for these respective risk groups. Conclusion(s): With appropriate treatment delivery and constraints, doseescalated prostate SBRT can be safely administered across multiple institutions. Toxicity rates and RFS rates compare favorably to other radiotherapies.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 136 patients were enrolled in a phase 1 dose-escalation study to determine the tolerance of escalating radiation dose levels of SBRT for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. The initial dose level was 32.5 Gy in 5 fractions, and doses were then sequentially escalated to 35 Gy, 37.5 Gy, and 40 Gy. Eligibility criteria included only patients with low and intermediate risk, and the maximum prostate volume was 60 cm(3). Patients treated with neoadjuvant androgen deprivation were excluded. The median follow-up in survivors for the 4 dose levels was 5.9, 5.4, 4.1, and 3.5 years, respectively. RESULTS: The incidence of acute grade 2 rectal toxicities for dose levels 1 to 4 were 0%, 2.9%, 2.8%, and 11.4% respectively. No grade 3 or 4 acute rectal toxicities were observed. The incidence of acute grade 2 urinary toxicities for dose levels 1 to 4 were 16.7%, 22.9%, 8.3%, and 17.1%, respectively. No grade 3 or 4 acute urinary toxicities were observed. No grade 2 or higher rectal toxicities were observed. The incidence of late grade 2 urinary toxicities for dose levels 1 to 4 was 23.3%, 25.7%, 27.8%, and 31.4%, respectively. Only 1 late grade 3 urinary toxicity (urethral stricture) developed in the 40-Gy dose arm; the stricture was corrected with transurethral resection. No grade 4 late urinary toxicity was observed. The 5-year cumulative incidence of prostate-specific antigen failure for dose levels 1 to 4 was 15%, 6%, 0%, and 0%. The incidence of a 2-year positive posttreatment biopsy was 47.6%, 19.2%, 16.7%, and 7.7%, respectively for the 4 dose arms (P = .013). CONCLUSIONS: SBRT doses ranging from 32.5 to 40 Gy in 5 fractions were well tolerated without severe urinary or rectal toxicities.

In the experimental arm, MR-guided de-escalation is performed within prostate adjacent to one neurovascular bundle (NVB). In this dosimetric pilot study, we assess the ability to salvage failures in the spared prostate with focal HDR brachytherapy. Materials/Methods: Three prostate cancer patients treated with combination HDR/EBRT unrelated to the protocol were used for modeling since they had both MR/CT with rectal spacer simulation and transrectal ultrasound images (TRUS) with modified peripheral loading needle placement. For the theoretical neurovascular-sparing plans, two PTVs were created: PTV30 (30Gy/5fx) = prostate + 3mm excluding NVB; PTV45 (45Gy/5fx) = PTV30 minus a 5mm avoidance on one side's neurovascular elements (contralateral to disease). Diffuse or focal (apical, mid, or base) failures in the spared area of prostate receiving <= 30Gy were modeled for salvage. PTV for salvage was defined as (GTV + 5mm) + (all initially spared prostate + 3mm) and restricted to gland and covered to 27Gy/2fx using only the already present needle locations on TRUS images. Constraints were based on existing HDR salvage protocols and included urethra D100% < 110% and rectal V80% < 0.2mL. Result(s): Coverage for simulated failures was maintained without sacrificing organ at risk (OAR) constraints. Urethral doses were highest in diffuse and focal base failures, but were within pre-specified constraints. Conclusion(s): We demonstrate that salvage brachytherapy after neurovascular-sparing SAbR is feasible and does not compromise target coverage or OAR constraints. While salvage after SAbR is not well described, this protocol establishes a realistic model for salvage HDR in the setting of anatomy-driven de-escalation in prostate cancer radiotherapy.

However, large, prospective studies are still required to evaluate the efficacy of this approach in different patient groups. This is the interim analysis of a prospective, single institution study of men relapsing with up to five synchronous lesions following definitive local treatment for primary PCa. Our aim was to determine the proportion of patients not requiring treatment escalation following SBRT. In total, 199 patients were enrolled to receive fractionated SBRT (50 Gray in 10 fractions) to each visible lesion. Fourteen patients were castration resistant at enrolment. The proportion of patients not requiring treatment escalation 2 years following SBRT was 51.7% (95% CI: 44.1-59.3%). The median length of treatment escalation-free survival over the entire follow-up period was 27.1 months (95% CI; 21.8-29.4 months). Prior androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) predicted a significantly lower rate of freedom from treatment escalation at 2 years compared to no prior ADT (odds ratio = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.08-0.54, p = 0.001). There was no difference in the efficacy of SBRT when treating 4-5 vs. 1-3 initial lesions. A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline was induced in 75% of patients, with PSA readings falling to an undetectable level in six patients. No late grade three toxicities were observed.

No standard local treatment exists for patients with an intraprostatic recurrence after radiotherapy. Stereotatic body radiotherapy (SBRT) could be a curative treatment for local recurrence. The phase I/II primary objective is the selection of the recommended dose for salvage-SBRT and to estimate the efficacy. Methods and analysis We plan to perform a multicentre prospective phase I/II study including at least 47 patients. Eligible patients are patients with biochemical recurrence occurring at least 2 years after external radiotherapy for prostatic adenocarcinoma by the Phoenix definition (prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir +2 ng/mL) and histologically proven intraprostatic recurrence only (stage T1-T2 on relapse, PSA level <=10 ng/mL, PSA doubling time >10 months, absence of pelvic or metastatic recurrence proven by choline or PSMA positron emission tomography scan, and pelvic and prostatic assessment by multiparametric MRI). The phase I primary objective is the selection of the recommended dose for salvage-SBRT (5x6, 6x6 or 5x5 Gy) based on dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The dose of salvage-SBRT will be selected using a time-To-event continual reassessment method based on DLT defined as grade >=3 gastrointestinal or urinary toxicity or any other grade 4 adverse event. The phase II primary outcome is to estimate the efficacy of the salvage-SBRT in terms of biochemical relapse-free survival rate (Phoenix definition: increase in serum total PSA >=2 ng/mL above the nadir). Phase II secondary outcomes are acute and late toxicities, quality of life, clinical progression-free survival defined as the time interval between the date of registration and the date of clinical progression or death irrespective of the cause.

random-journal.pdf,ProP100,"Gurka, Marie K",2015,eng,pro.p,Hematuria following stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for clinically localized prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Hematuria following prostate radiotherapy is a known toxicity that may adversely affect a patient's quality of life. Given the higher dose of radiation per fraction using stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) there is concern that post-SBRT hematuria would be more common than with alternative radiation therapy approaches. Herein, we describe the incidence and severity of hematuria following stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for prostate cancer at our institution. METHODS: Two hundred and eight consecutive patients with prostate cancer treated with SBRT monotherapy with at least three years of follow-up were included in this retrospective analysis. Treatment was delivered using the CyberKnife® (Accuray) to doses of 35-36.25 Gy in 5 fractions. Toxicities were scored using the CTCAE v.4. Hematuria was counted at the highest grade it occurred in the acute and late setting for each patient. Cystoscopy findings were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Hematuria-associated bother was assessed via the Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC)-26. RESULTS: The median age was 69 years with a median prostate volume of 39 cc. With a median follow-up of 48 months, 38 patients (18.3%) experienced at least one episode of hematuria. Median time to hematuria was 13.5 months. In the late period, there were three grade 3 events and five grade 2 events. There were no grade 4 or 5 events. The 3-year actuarial incidence of late hematuria ≥ grade 2 was 2.4%. On univariate analysis, prostate volume (p = 0.022) and history of prior procedure(s) for benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) (p = 0.002) were significantly associated with hematuria. On multivariate analysis, history of prior procedure(s) for BPH (p < 0.0001) and α1A antagonist use (p = 0.008) were significantly associated with the development of hematuria. CONCLUSIONS: SBRT for prostate cancer was well tolerated with hematuria rates comparable to other radiation modalities. Patients factors associated with BPH, such as larger prostate volume, alpha antagonist usage, and prior history of procedures for BPH are at increased risk for the development of hematuria.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,10.1186/s13014-015-0351-6,,,

We report our preliminary results using SBRT in monotherapy or pre-external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) boost in patients with localized prostate cancer (LpC). The primary end point was the evaluation of both acute and late toxicities; secondary end point was the observation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with LpC having prostate volume ≤90 cm(3) were enrolled in the present study. Patients were treated with SBRT alone or in combined modality (SBRT + EBRT). SBRT was performed using a CyberKnife System (Accuray Incorporated, Sunnyvale, California) and fiducial tracking system. RESULTS: From February 2008 to July 2013, 21 patients for monotherapy (38 Gy/4 fractions) and 5 for combined modality (9.5 Gy/2 fractions plus 46 Gy/23 fractions EBRT) were enrolled. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was administered in 16 of the 26 patients. The median pretreatment PSA was 9.4 (range, 4.5-14.3) ng/mL. All patients completed the planned therapy. Acute Grade 1 toxicity was observed in 18 patients, genitourinary (GU) in 12 / 26 patients, and gastrointestinal (GI) in 6 / 26 patients. Acute Grade 2 GU toxicity was reported in 1 / 26 patients, and Grade 2 GI toxicity was observed in 2 / 26 patients. The median PSA nadir was 0.15 (range, 0.02 = 1.4) ng/mL. Late toxicities were observed in 5 / 26 patients: Grade 1 GU (3 of 26), Grade 2 GU (1 of 26), and Grade 1 GI (1 of 26). Median follow-up was 21.5 (range, 8-65) months. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results of SBRT ""simulating"" HDR for LpC confirm a minimal toxicity and an optimal PSA response.

External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is non-invasive, standard of care and delivered in either conventional fractionation over 8 weeks or with moderate hypo-fractionation over about 5 weeks. Recent advances in radiotherapy technology have made extreme hypo-fractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) of prostate cancer feasible, which has not yet been introduced as a standard treatment method in Germany. Initial results from other countries are promising, but long-term results are not yet available. The aim of this study is to investigate feasibility and effectiveness of SBRT for prostate cancer in Germany. Methods/design: This German bi-center single group trial (HYPOSTAT) is designed to evaluate feasibility and effectiveness, as measured by toxicity and PSA-response, respectively, of an extreme hypo-fractionated SBRT regimen with five fractions of 7 Gy in treatment of localized low and intermediate risk prostate cancer. The target volume includes the prostate with or without the base of seminal vesicles depending on risk stratification and uncertainty margins that are kept at 3-5 mm. SBRT treatment is delivered with the robotic CyberKnife system, which was recently introduced in Germany. Acute and late toxicity after one year will be evaluated according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v. 4.0), Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) Scores. The quality of life will be assessed before and after treatment with the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire. Hypothesizing that the proportion of patients with grade 2 side effects or higher is less or equal than 2.8%, thus markedly lower than the standard EBRT percentage (17.5%), the recruitment target is 85 patients. Discussion(s): The HYPOSTAT trial aims at demonstrating short term feasibility of extreme hypo-fractioned SBRT for the treatment of prostate cancer and might be used as the pilot study for a multi-center multi-platform or for randomized-controlled trials comparing conventional radiotherapy with SBRT for localized prostate cancer in the future. The study concept of patient enrollment, follow up and evaluation by multiple public university clinics and actual patient treatment in dedicated private radiosurgery practices with high-tech radiation equipment is unique for clinical trials.

We report interim results for an ongoing, multi-institution phase 2 trial evaluating efficacy and safety of SBRT for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Materials/Methods: Patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer, defined as low-risk (cT1b-T2a, Gleason 2-6, and prostate-specific antigen [PSA] <=10) or intermediate-risk (cT2b, Gleason 2-6, and PSA <=10; cT1b-T2a, Gleason 2-6, and PSA 10-20; or cT1b-T2a, Gleason 7, and PSA <=10), with prostate volume <=100 mL and life expectancy of >=10 years were enrolled. Patients received hypofractionated SBRT, consisting of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions delivered on nonconsecutive days using a medical linear accelerator treatment delivery system (57.1%) or robotic radiosurgery (42.9%). Primary endpoints include late gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity and biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS) using the Phoenix definition of >2 ng/mL above nadir. PSA bounce was defined as >=0.2 ng/mL above nadir with a subsequent decrease. Result(s): Forty-two consecutive patients were analyzed from 2011 to 2013. Median age was 66 years with a median KPS of 100%. Overall, 19 (45.2%) and 23 (54.8%) met low- and intermediate-risk criteria. The following characteristics were noted: T1c (73.8%), initial PSA <10 (81.0%), Gleason 3+3 (50.0%), prostate volume (median 45 mL), and percent core positivity (median 25.0%). At a median follow-up of 18.6 months (range 2.7-43.1 months), the estimated 18-month bPFS was 97.1% (95% CI 91.6%-100.0%). No patients developed acute or late grade 3-5 toxicity. Acute and late grade 2 GI toxicity rates were 2.4% (crude) and 0.0% (18-month estimate). Acute and late grade 2 GU toxicity rates were 42.9% (crude) and 27.0% (18-month estimate). Mean urethral dose trended toward correlation with late grade 2 GU toxicity (HR 1.21, P=.097). PSA bounce occurred in 15 (35.7%) patients and was significantly associated with mean urethral dose (HR 1.31, P=.024). Compared to pretreatment scores, mean AUA scores increased 1 week after treatment (difference +5.1, P<.001) and normalized by 18 months (difference -0.2, P=.719). SHIM scores decreased at 1 month (difference -2.6, P=.025) with no significant difference thereafter. Conclusion(s): Based on early interim results in a multi-institutional phase 2 trial, SBRT appears to be a safe and efficacious treatment option for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients. Although these results need to be validated upon trial completion, urethral dose appears to be a significant predictor of PSA bounce, which may also translate to correlation with late GU toxicity. As done with brachytherapy, urethral constraints may be critical to decrease late GU toxicity.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,,,,

There is a need for more data about SBRT, especially in high-risk PCa patients. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the safety and the short-term efficacy of robotic SBRT in a clinical patient cohort with localized PCa including also high-risk patients (D'Amico risk stratification). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 240 consecutive patients with clinically localized PCa were treated primarily with SBRT to total doses of 35 Gy or 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions using a robotic SBRT device (CyberKnife(®)). All risk groups (D'Amico risk stratification) were represented as follows: 48 (22%), 59 (27%) and 111 (51%) of the patients representing low-, intermediate- and high-risk group, respectively. Data on acute and intermediate-term toxicities and early PSA responses were analyzed. RESULTS: Neither acute grade 3 or higher GU nor rectal toxicity was observed. Regardless of the fact that 29 (13.3%) patients experienced intermediate-term toxicity requiring diagnostic interventions, the rates of intermediate-term grade 3 GU, rectal and infectious toxicity were low, 1.8%, 0.9% and 1.4%, respectively. A biochemical relapse was observed in ten (4.6%) patients. With the median follow-up time of 23 months the biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS) rate was 100%, 96.6% and 92.8% in low-, intermediate- and high-risk group, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The toxicity of robotic SBRT in a large clinical cohort of PCa patients was tolerable and the early PSA response was good in all risk groups.

Material and Methods This study was based on a prospective analysis of 42 patients enrolled between May 2013 and November 2014. For planning, the GTV included the prostate with the 1/3 proximal seminal vesicles without margin; a margin of 5 mm in all directions around the GTV was applied to define the PTV. All patients were treated with IG-SBRT, utilizing VMAT technique with a 2 full arcs arrangement and photons with beam energy of 6 MV, according to pre-established treatment dose specifications and DHV constraints: in particular, for PTV, plans were optimised aiming to obtain V95%>95% D98%>94%, V2%<108%; concerning the rectum, the requirements were: mean<18Gy, V20<35%, V32 <10%, V37<5%,D1%<40Gy while for the bladder, the goal was to keep mean dose <14 Gy and V21 <40%, V33 < 30%, V38 <13%,D1%<40Gy. Routine institutional image-based patient position verification protocols foresaw daily on-line matching by CBCT. The acute and late toxicities were recorded using the RTOG/EORTC scale. Additional data were collected by means of I-PSS e IIEF-5 questionnaires. Biochemical failure was determined using the Phoenix definition. Results The median follow-up duration was 27 months (range: 24 to 36 months). The median age was 74 years (range: 57-80 years). Most dosimetric parameters for the OARs are well within the protocol constraints, with the n otable exception of maximal doses to rectum and bladder (exceeding in about 20% of cases), but we did not find any statistical correlation with late toxicities. Acute GU toxicity of grade 2 (increase in urinary frequency) was observed in 7% patients. The incidence rates of late GI and GU toxicity of any grade were 14.2% and 35.7%, respectively. The late GU toxicity of grade >= 2 was 4.7%. No GE late toxicity >= 2 was noted. Previous abdominal surgery appeared to be statistically significant (p= 0.004; Fisher's test) for the increase of probability of late GE toxicity. The 3-year local recurrence-free survival rate was 98%, only one patient had clinical abdominal lymph node failure. Among the dosimetric data, only V21 (mean value: 22.1%; range: 8.5-55.2%) revealed to be statistically significant for the late GU (p= 0.035; Wilcoxon Mann Whitney Test). Conclusion Our experience with VMAT-based SBRT in low-and intermediate-risk prostate cancer demonstrates favorable efficacy in tumor control and toxicity profile with no decrease in QOL as determined by I-PSS, IIEF.

random-journal.pdf,ProP106,"A., Magli",2015,English,pro.p,Image-guided hypofractionated radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer with 42Gy in 7 fractions: Radiobiology and preliminary clinical results of a phase-II study,"Introduction: The evolution of radiation technology, which integrates 3-dimensional anatomy, conformal dose coverage and image guidance combined with a a better understanding of prostate cancer radiobiology and fraction sensitivity of the tumor relative to nearby normal tissue, has led to hypofractionated radiation therapy schedules. Clinical data now exist from several studies, including randomized trials using various moderately hypofractionated regimens, with dose-per-fraction ranging from 2.5 Gy per fraction for 70 Gy and 3.1 Gy per fraction for 62 Gy (1, 2) up to, more recently, extreme hypofractionation schemes of 7.25 Gy per fraction for 36.25 Gy or 10 Gy for 5 fraction (3) using stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) approaches. Hypofractionation for prostate cancer, and in particular SBRT, results in a means of radiobiological dose escalation and potentially represents a therapeutic gain. It also affords a more economical course of definitive radiation therapy, improves patient access to care and enhances patient convenience. Aim(s): We have performed a phase II study concerning hypofractionated radiotherapy (HRT) with a dose of 42 Gy in 7 fractions, in patients with localized prostate cancer at low/intermediate risk (according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) score) and risk of lymph node involvement <17% ( Roach Index) in order to evaluate the feasibility and acute toxicity. Material(s) and Method(s): Since 2012, 40 patients at low/intermediate risk for localized prostate cancer have been planned for HRT (Table I). Fraction size is 6 Gy for 7 fractions scheduled to be delivered twice a week for a total dose of 42 Gy. Treatment has been delivered with a VMAT technique, with 2 arcs using 6MV photons from a Varian 2300 iX linac. Planning was performed with Eclipse 10.0 TPS with the AAA algorithm by 3 different planners. Dose prescription is the average dose to PTV with the request V95%>=95%. The dose-volume histogram (DVH) constraints for organs at risk (OARs) have been derived from literature and local experience. Constraints for acute urinary toxicity have been recently introduced after the paper of Carillo et al. (4). To reduce the organ motion, patients have been premedicated before treatment with butylscopolamine. The protocol is based on 3 image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) intraprostatic fiducial markers, with daily online checks by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). The acute and late toxicity is recorded using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) scale. Additional data are collected by means of International Prostate Symptom Score (II-PSS) and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaires. Result(s): Thirty-two patients have been followed for three months or more. Urinary toxicities were most common. At 3 month, 12% of patients reported grades 1 urinary toxicities (RTOG/EORTC scale). At 6 months no patients reported grade 1 urinary toxicities. At 18 months, one patient reported grade 1 proctitis and grade 1 rectal bleeding, which resolved without intervention. Thirteen patients have been followed for 12 months or more. Biochemical response was rapid the first 12 months of follow-up: mean pre-treatment and 12-month post-treatment values were 3.75 ng/ml and 0.7 ng/ml, respectively. The results of organ motion intrafraction (OMI) movement are shown in Figure 1. By implementing principals of manipulation and premedication of the patient we have a control of OMI <=2 mm in 98% of treatment sessions. Conclusion(s): Intrafraction motion of the prostate is minimal when patients follow the special diet and are premedicated before treatment with butylscopolamine. The proposed scheme is estimated more effective to high-dose conventional regimens. The absence of acute toxicity seems to confirm the validity of the adopted normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model and could be predictive of late toxicity. At this early follow-up point, prostate HRT results in favorable toxicity and biochemical outcomes and appears to support the strategy of hypofractionation in the management of localized prostate cancer. Further follow-up is necessary to validate these early, promising results. (Figure Presented).",exclusion,Other study design (phase I/II),,,,,,

In this study, we aimed to assess the role of IG-SBRT in terms of local control and safety in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary and secondary endpoints of this prospective observational study were local control and safety related to IG-SBRT. All lesions were treated with 24 Gy as a single fraction or 27 Gy in 3 fractions. After SBRT, Systemic therapies were administered only after the occurrence of more than three synchronous active lesions in oligometastatic patients (patients with less than 4 active synchronous lesions) or new lesions occurrence in patients with more than 3 synchronous lesions. RESULTS: From April 2011 to June 2017, 78 metastatic lesions (32 bone and 46 node) from 51 patients with prostate cancer were treated. After a median follow-up of 18.5 months (range=3-103 months), only 2 lesions (4%) relapsed inside the radiation field. All local recurrences were located on the bone. Estimated 12 and 24 months local control ratios were 98.7 and 97.4%, respectively. Except for one case, toxicity greater than G2 was not recorded. CONCLUSION: IG-SBRT is safe and can be considered as a valid therapy in patients with metastatic prostate cancer requiring a long-lasting metastases control.",exclusion,Other study design,,PM82,10.21873/anticanres.12572,,,

For oligometastases from various primary tumors such as colorectal cancer, sarcomas and renal cell carcinoma, MDT is commonly offered,5-9, 13-15 even though no randomized trials are available comparing MDT with alternative options.13-15 The interest in MDT in PCa has certainly increased with the introduction of more accurate imaging modalities,16, 17 which led to higher detection of oligometastatic PCa recurrence at lower prostate-specific antigen levels.11, 16 However, many questions remain to be solved before MDT is ready for implementation in clinical routine.18.",exclusion,review,Llegir per a informació general,PM83,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajco.12557,,,

Freedom from biochemical failure remains suboptimal, due to poor detection of nodal and distant metastasis. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-PET has revolutionised re-staging in this group, by detecting low-volume metastasis at low PSA levels. PSMA-PET can influence salvage RT by altering target volumes, facilitating stereotactic RT, and omitting RT in widespread disease. Our primary objective is to examine the management impact of 18F-DCFPyL PET in men referred for salvage RT post RP. Secondary endpoints include comparing management impact of CT to PSMA-PET and assessing biochemical control. Method(s): IMPPORT is a prospective multi- centre trial which commenced recruitment in July 2018, with a target of 100 participants. Eligibility criteria includes biochemical recurrence (PSA > 0.2 but < 2.0), prior RP with negative pre-operative staging, and no previous pelvic RT or ADT. Initial management intent is completed followed by diagnostic CTCAP and 18FDCFPyL PET. Images are interpreted by dedicated radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians, blinded to images from the alternative modality. Result release is staggered to radiation oncologists, to allow management intent to be captured post CT alone, then post CT with PSMA-PET results. Result(s): 18 patients are enrolled, and the initial 13 have completed imaging and intent plans. There was change in management seen in 23% (n = 3) post CT, compared to 46% (n = 6) post CT and 18FDCFPyL PET together. In 6 patients with changed management intent post CT and PSMA-PET, addition of pelvic RT with nodal boost and ADT was seen in 3. Of the remaining 3, one had pelvic nodal boost included, one changed to ADT only due to widespread metastasis seen, and one had an inguinal node biopsy and targeted RT. Conclusion(s): IMPPORT has seen promising early results with almost 50% of initial patients demonstrating change in management intent post 18F-DCFPyL PET.",exclusion,Not dealing with the intervention of interest,,PM85,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bju.14723,,,

In addition to the advantages of improved soft-tissue contrast and on-table daily plan re-optimization, marker-less continuous MR-imaging during delivery allows treatment with only minimal (3 mm) safety margins thereby optimally sparing the adjacent rectum and bladder. A prospective phase II study [NCT03961321] investigated the toxicity of this approach during the first year of follow-up. Patient-reported data are the most reliable outcome measures for toxicity and the impact on quality of life, and these are reported here. MS.U., T., A.M.E., B., S.S., O., B.J., S., & R.J.A., V. M.

METHODS: Patients with low to favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, or high-dose rate brachytherapy were surveyed. The questionnaire explored the decision-making experience, treatment experience, and treatment regret. RESULTS: In total, 322 consecutive patients were surveyed with an 86% (n=276) response rate. In total, 48% (n=132) selected their radiation oncologist as the primary information source, 23% (n=62) selected their urologist, 16% (n=44) selected the Internet, 6% (n=17) selected other patients, and 8% (n=21) selected other. In total, 39% of patients who selected the Internet as their primary information source reported their actual treatment experience to be worse than expected versus 13% of respondents who selected their urologist, 12% who selected other patients, and 2% who selected their radiation oncologist (P<0.01). Similarly, 43% who selected the Internet as their primary information source endorsed treatment regret versus 10% who selected their urologist, and 7% who selected their radiation oncologist (P<0.01). On multivariate regression, only patients who selected the Internet as their primary information source were more likely to endorse treatment regret (odds ratio, 46.47; P<0.001) and a worse treatment perception (odds ratio, 83.33; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who used the Internet as their primary information source were significantly more likely to endorse treatment regret and a worse than expected overall treatment experience.

Introduction: The Printout (Using breath analysis to PRedIct Normal TissUe and Tumour response during prostate SBRT) [1] Trial is a prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) pilot study currently being undertaken at the Edinburgh Cancer Centre. The primary objective is to establish the possibility of measuring biomarkers in breath samples to monitor an individual's response to radiotherapy. It is hoped to gain enough data from the pilot to progress to a larger scale study. Responsibility for the running of the trial including patient screening, recruitment, treatment delivery, data collection and management has been delegated to radiographers. Method and Materials: Printout patients attend for a multi parametric MRI scan, transperineal implantation of the raypilot prostate tracking device [2] and a planning CT scan as an outpatient during one day. A SBRT treatment plan is constructed using the rigidly fused MRI and CT scan. A dose of 36.25Gy is delivered in 5 fractions by a Varian Trubeam linear accelerator over 7 days, with breath samples acquired before and after each session. Kilovoltage imaging, CBCT and raypilot are used to monitor and verify treatment position. Patient reported outcome measures (PROMS) questionnaires are completed prior to treatment delivery, immediately on completion of treatment and at regular follow up appointments. Result(s): 5 patients have participated in the trial. Early data suggests hypofractionated SBRT can be delivered safely to the prostate gland using the Raypilot Device as a motion management system. PROMS have reported toxicities which are well tolerated, with the regime itself a very welcome alternative to conventional fractionation. Data regarding heterogeneity factors has yet to be reported. Conclusion/ Discussion: The Printout Trial is the first time radiographers in the department have been involved in both the technical and administration part of trial set up and design. Recruitment, although slow initially, has improved and it is hoped that one patient per month will now be enrolled. The trial has demonstrated the vital role radiographers play in radiotherapy research and also problems which can arise from the regulations surrounding research governance.

Distinguishing PP from true tumor progression is critical. OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence, time of onset, and time range of PP following stereotactic body radiation therapy in patients treated for spinal metastases from either prostate cancer (PC) or renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and associated predictive factors. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on our institution's cancer database from 2009 to 2015. Selection was based on single level, no prior radiation or surgery, ≥2 follow-up spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and metastases arising from either PC or RCC. Gross tumor volume was contoured on pre- and up to 5 posttreatment MRIs. Patients were sorted into groups depending on gross tumor volume response: PP, non-PP, or progressive disease. Clinical and dosimetric variables were compared using either Fisher's exact test or Kruskal-Wallis analyses. RESULTS: Forty-three spinal segments from 31 patients were analyzed. RCC and PC patients showed similar incidence of PP (∼37%). Whether the primary was lytic or sclerotic was a significant predictive factor with more PP in the lytic group (P = .0208). There was a trend of earlier PP onset in RCC (within 6-18 mo) as compared to PC; however, PC segments showed more time-confined presentation of PP (9-12 mo). CONCLUSION: There was a higher incidence of PP in lytic compared to sclerotic primary tumor type. PP in spinal metastatic sites may have variable presentations depending on the primary cancer.",exclusion,Other tumor treated (spinal),,PM88,10.1093/neuros/nyy075,,,

Moderate hypofractionation has been shown to be non-inferior to conventional fractionation. Ultra-hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy would allow shorter treatment courses but could increase acute toxicity compared with conventionally fractionated or moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy. We report the acute toxicity findings from a randomised trial of standard-of-care conventionally fractionated or moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy versus five-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy for low-risk to intermediate-risk localised prostate cancer. Method(s): PACE is an international, phase 3, open-label, randomised, non-inferiority trial. In PACE-B, eligible men aged 18 years and older, with WHO performance status 0-2, low-risk or intermediate-risk prostate adenocarcinoma (Gleason 4 + 3 excluded), and scheduled to receive radiotherapy were recruited from 37 centres in three countries (UK, Ireland, and Canada). Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) by computerised central randomisation with permuted blocks (size four and six), stratified by centre and risk group, to conventionally fractionated or moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy (78 Gy in 39 fractions over 7.8 weeks or 62 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks, respectively) or stereotactic body radiotherapy (36.25 Gy in five fractions over 1-2 weeks). Neither participants nor investigators were masked to allocation. Androgen deprivation was not permitted. The primary endpoint of PACE-B is freedom from biochemical or clinical failure. The coprimary outcomes for this acute toxicity substudy were worst grade 2 or more severe Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) gastrointestinal or genitourinary toxic effects score up to 12 weeks after radiotherapy. Analysis was per protocol. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01584258. PACE-B recruitment is complete and follow-up is ongoing. Finding(s): Between Aug 7, 2012, and Jan 4, 2018, we randomly assigned 874 men to conventionally fractionated or moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy (n=441) or stereotactic body radiotherapy (n=433). 432 (98%) of 441 patients allocated to conventionally fractionated or moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy and 415 (96%) of 433 patients allocated to stereotactic body radiotherapy received at least one fraction of allocated treatment. Worst acute RTOG gastrointestinal toxic effect proportions were as follows: grade 2 or more severe toxic events in 53 (12%) of 432 patients in the conventionally fractionated or moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy group versus 43 (10%) of 415 patients in the stereotactic body radiotherapy group (difference -1.9 percentage points, 95% CI -6.2 to 2.4; p=0.38). Worst acute RTOG genitourinary toxicity proportions were as follows: grade 2 or worse toxicity in 118 (27%) of 432 patients in the conventionally fractionated or moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy group versus 96 (23%) of 415 patients in the stereotactic body radiotherapy group (difference -4.2 percentage points, 95% CI -10.0 to 1.7; p=0.16). No treatment-related deaths occurred. Interpretation(s): Previous evidence (from the HYPO-RT-PC trial) suggested higher patient-reported toxicity with ultrahypofractionation. By contrast, our results suggest that substantially shortening treatment courses with stereotactic body radiotherapy does not increase either gastrointestinal or genitourinary acute toxicity.

In the case of severe axial loading impairment, anterior column reconstruction is indicated. The authors describe the use of interbody distraction to restore vertebral body height and correct kyphotic angulation prior to reconstruction with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), and report the long-term durability of such reconstruction. METHODS A single institution, prospective series of patients with ESCC undergoing single-stage decompression, anterior column reconstruction, and posterior instrumentation from 2013 to 2016 was retrospectively analyzed. Several demographic, perioperative, and radiographic measurements were collected. Descriptive statistics were compiled, in addition to postoperative changes in anterior height, posterior height, and kyphosis. Paired Student t-tests were performed for each variable. Overall survival was calculated using the techniques described by Kaplan and Meier. RESULTS Twenty-one patients underwent single-stage posterior decompression with interbody distraction and anterior column reconstruction using PMMA. The median age and Karnofsky Performance Scale score were 61 years and 70, respectively. Primary tumors included renal cell (n = 8), lung (n = 4), multiple myeloma (n = 2), prostate (n = 2), and other (n = 5). Eighteen patients underwent a single-level vertebral body reconstruction and 3 underwent multilevel transpedicular corpectomies. The median survival duration was 13.3 months. In the immediate postoperative setting, statistically significant improvement was noted in anterior body height (p = 0.0017, 95% confidence interval [CI] -4.15 to -1.11) and posterior body height (p = 0.0116, 95% CI -3.14 to -0.45) in all patients, and improved kyphosis was observed in those with oblique endplates (p = 0.0002, 95% CI 11.16-20.27). In the median follow-up duration of 13.9 months, the authors observed 3 cases of asymptomatic PMMA subsidence. One patient required reoperation in the form of extension of fusion. CONCLUSIONS In situ interbody distraction allows safe and durable reconstruction with PMMA, restores vertebral height, and corrects kyphotic deformities associated with severe pathological fractures caused by tumor. This is accomplished with minimal manipulation of the thecal sac and avoiding an extensive 360° surgical approach in patients who cannot tolerate extensive surgery.",exclusion,Other tumor treated (spinal),,PM91,10.3171/2017.4.SPINE161182,,,

The importance of consolidating all macroscopic tumor deposits in prostate cancer in the modern era is an unanswered question. Stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR) is highly focused, high-dose radiation that is ideally suited for treatment of oligometastatic patients. There are also exciting animal and patient studies suggesting that SABR can activate the immune system against cancer cells. Here we report on interim safety, clinical and translational outcomes of our Phase II randomized trial of SABR to men with recurrent low volume (1-3 metastases) hormone sensitive metastatic prostate cancer. Material and Methods Patients are randomized 2:1 to SABR:observation with minimization to balance assignment by primary intervention, prior hormonal therapy, and PSA doubling time. Progression after 6 months will be compared using Fisher's exact test. Hazard ratios and Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression free survival (PFS), ADT free survival (ADT-FS), time to locoregional progression (TTLP) and time to distant progression (TTDP) will be calculated based on an intention-to-treat. Local control will be assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria. Adverse events will be summarized by type and grade. Quality of life pre- and post- SABR will be measured by Brief Pain Inventory. Further fundamental analysis of the oligometastatic state with be achieved through correlation with germline DNA repair gene mutations using the Color Genomics panel, investigational 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging and measurement of circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA and deep sequencing of circulating T-cell receptor repertoires. Results Since activation in April 2016 we have had enrollment of 37 men and subsequent randomization of 36 out of the target 54. Thus far, as expected only minimal side-effects (no >Grade 3 toxicity) have been observed from the SABR alone. 67% (6/9) of eligible men on the observation arm have progressed at 6-months versus 33% (5/15) for the SABR arm. 2/20 (10%) men tested had germline DNA repair gene mutations (MUTYH c.1187G>A & CHEK2 c1555C>T). CellSearchTM detected only 1 CTC/7.5-ml in two men and the remaining eight men had no CTCs (20% detectability). In contrast, 9/17 (53% detectability) men had detectable CTCs using the HD-CTC platform and 3/4 (75%) interpretable cases showed a response following SABR. Other radiologic and blood correlatives are pending analysis and will be presented. Conclusion The ORIOLE trial (NCT02680587) is the first randomized Phase II study in the Western Hemisphere evaluating the safety and efficacy of SABR in oligometastatic hormonesensitive prostate cancer. Preliminary clinical data is promising and leading-edge laboratory and imaging correlates will allow an unprecedented opportunity to characterize, in isolation, the effects of SABR on the dynamics of and immunologic response of the oligometastatic state.",exclusion,Not the right comparator,,PM92,,,,

However, ADT can be associated with prolonged erectile dysfunction due to delayed testosterone recovery. Darolutamide is a second-generation androgen receptor with low blood-brain barrier penetration. We hypothesize that men who receive Darolutamide with RT rather than ADT with RT are able to achieve surrogate PSA endpoints indicative of long-term disease control while preserving erectile function. Method(s): This is an open label, phase 2B, multi-center, randomized controlled trial. Eligibility criteria include intermediate risk prostate cancer, good erectile quality per the EPIC-26 questionnaire, and archival tissue suitable for submission to Decipher Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Men will be stratified by Decipher score (low/intermediate vs high), RT modality (EBRT vs Brachytherapy/stereotactic body radiation therapy/combination RT), and age (>65 vs <65). Men with a Decipher high score will be strongly encouraged to undergo extreme RT dose-escalation. The primary endpoint is PSA nadir < 0.5 within 6 months from end of treatment (EOT). The hierarchical endpoint is maintenance of good erectile quality at 3 months from EOT. The key secondary endpoint is interval to PSA failure at 3 years from EOT. Endpoints will be analyzed in a fixed-sequence hierarchical method. 220 patients will be accrued over 3 years. Non-inferiority margins for the primary and key secondary endpoints are 9% (90% power) and 4.9% (80% power), respectively. Men will be randomized to 6 months of GnRH agonist plus bicalutamide 50 mg daily with RT or 6 months of darolutamide 600 mg twice daily with RT.

random-journal.pdf,ProP118,"Kole, Thomas P",2016,eng,pro.p,Late urinary toxicity modeling after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in the definitive treatment of localized prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Late urinary symptom flare has been shown to occur in a small subset of men treated with ultra- hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for prostate cancer. The purpose of this study was to use normal tissue complication probability modeling in an effort to derive SBRT specific dosimetric predictor's of late urinary flare. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two hundred and sixteen men were treated for localized prostate cancer using ultra- hypofractionated SBRT. A dose of 35-36.25 Gy in 5 fractions was delivered to the prostate and proximal seminal vesicles. Functional surveys were conducted before and after treatment to assess late toxicity. Phenomenologic NTCP models were fit to bladder DVHs and late urinary flare outcomes using maximum likelihood estimation. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients experienced late urinary flare within two years of completion of treatment. Fitting of bladder DVH data to a Lyman NTCP model resulted in parameter estimates of m, TD50, and n of 0.19 (0-0.47), 38.7 Gy (31.1-46.4), and 0.13 (-0.14-0.41), respectively. Subsequent fit to a hottest volume probit model revealed a significant association of late urinary flare with dose to the hottest 12.7% of bladder volume. Multivariate analysis resulted in a final model that included patient age and hottest volume probit model predictions. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a two-year urinary flare free survival of 95.7% in patients 65 years or older with a bladder D12.7% of 33.5 Gy or less, compared to 74.5% in patients meeting none of these criteria. CONCLUSION: NTCP modeling of late urinary flare after ultra-hypofractionated prostate SBRT demonstrates a relatively small volume effect for dose to the bladder, suggesting that reduction of volume receiving elevated dose will result in decreased incidence of late urinary toxicity. Future studies will be needed to examine the impact of dose to other potential sources of late genitourinary toxicity.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,10.3109/0284186X.2015.1037011,,,

Type of primary, site of metastases, and number of total lesions were analyzed to determine the efficacy of concurrent SBRT and nelfinavir for prostate, sarcoma, and other solid tumor histologies. Purpose/Objective(s): Patients (pts) with <=5 histologic confirmed metastatic lesions (<= 5.0 cm or <=250 cm3) of lung, liver, lymph nodes, or bone, and good performance status (ECOG <= 2) were eligible. Pts were given 1250 mg of nelfinavir twice daily for 7 days prior to and after a single dose of 15 Gy SBRT per lesion. Responses were evaluated based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. Prognostic variables were assessed using log-rank tests and Cox regression analyses. Result(s): Thirty-seven patients with 68 lesions were treated from January 2014-December 2015. Of 37 patients, 19 (51%) had prostate cancer, 8 had sarcoma (22%), 2 had lung (5%), 2 had breast cancer (5%), and 6 other histologies (16%). Of 68 lesions treated, 38 were in bone (56%), 19 were in lung (28%), 8 were in lymph nodes (12%), and 3 were in liver (4%). The median follow-up was 17.9 months (range, 5-31.5 months). The 6-month (6mo) freedom from local progression (FFLP) by treated lesion for prostate, sarcoma, and other primary tumor sites was 91.7%, 56.3%, and 62.5%, respectively (p<0.0001). FFLP by patient for site of metastases in the liver/bone, lymph node, and lung was 77.3%, 100%, and 66.7%, respectively (p=0.11). FFLP by lesion for site of metastases in the liver/bone, lymph node, and lung was 78.0%, 100%, and 63.2%, respectively (p=0.02). Compared with prostate cancer, sarcoma or other primary histologies had higher risk of developing local progression, with HR of 12.1 (p=0.003) and 11.2 (p=0.0027), respectively on univariate analysis. Receiving protocol treatment to 3 or more lesions compared to 1 lesion was associated with a significantly higher FFLP (HR=3.2, p=0.03). Conclusion(s): Local control of the treated lesion after SBRT and nelfinavir was significantly higher in patients with prostate cancer compared to sarcomas and other solid tumor histologies. Additionally, patients who received protocol treatment to one lesion were more likely to be locally controlled than those who received treatment to three or more sites. Prostate cancer patients with less than 3 metastatic lesions may derive the most therapeutic benefit from SBRT delivered to 15 Gy in one fraction in combination with nelfinavir.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,PM93,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.06.1870,,,

The aim of the present study was to compare two cohorts of patients treated with moderate hypofractionation (MHRT) or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Method(s): We included patients treated between 2010 and 2015. Inclusion criteria were: Adenocarcinoma of the prostate; class risks low or intermediate; WHO performance status 0-2. We evaluated rectal, gastrointestinal toxicity and genitourinary. Measures of outcome were biochemical disease-free survival and overall survival. Propensity score was used to approximate the balance in covariates. Result(s): 209 patients were included, treated with MHRT (n = 109) or SBRT (n = 100). Median follow-up time was 37.4 months. Rates of biochemical disease-free survival at 1- and 3 years were 100 and 95%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.868). Rates of overall survival at 1- and 3 years were 100 and 97.1%, respectively with no differences between the two groups (p = 0.312). After propensity scoring matching, no differences were observed in terms of acute and late rectal and gastrointestinal toxicity. While mild genitourinary side-effects were more common in SBRT group (45.5% vs 19.5 %), Grade 2 and 3 toxicity was increased after MHRT (11.7% vs 2.6 %; p = 0.029). Conclusion(s): Moderate hypofractionation and SBRT are two effective and safe options for the treatment of low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The analysis showed no difference in terms of disease's control and survival but increased moderate and severe toxicity after MHRT. Advances in knowledge: Moderate hypofractionation and SBRT are comparable in terms of efficacy while moderate and severe toxicity is more common in the first one.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.",inclusion,,Confirmar si es pot utilitzar MHRT com a comparador,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20190021,inclusion,,

METHODS: Patients with localized prostate cancer treated with SBRT at three academic hospitals were enrolled. Treatment was delivered using Cyberknife with dose range from 35 to 37.5 Gy in 5 fractions. Biochemical failure (BCF) was assessed with Phoenix definition and toxicities were scored with Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) toxicity criteria. The PSA kinetics were analyzed in patients who received no androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and showed no recurrence. RESULTS: Of the total 88 patients, 14 patients (15.9%) received ADT. After median follow-up of 63.8 months, the 5-year BCF free survival (BCFFS) was 94.7%. Two patients experienced late grade ≥ 3 GI toxicities (2.2%). The median nadir PSA was 0.12 ng/mL (range, 0.00-2.62 ng/mL) and the median time to nadir was 44.8 months (range, 0.40-85.7 months). Patients who reached nadir before 24 months showed poorer BCFFS than the others. The rate of PSA decline was maximum in the first year after treatment and gradually decreased with time. The pattern of PSA change was significantly different according to the risk groups (p = 0.011) with the slope of - 0.139, - 0.161 and - 0.253 ng/mL/month in low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: SBRT for localized prostate cancer showed favorable efficacy with minimal toxicities. The time to PSA nadir was significantly associated with treatment outcome.

Methods and Materials: This prospective trial included 40 patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer who underwent low-dose-rate (Pd-103) brachytherapy (prescription dose, 100 Gy), followed 1 month later with ultrahypofractionated stereotactic RT (25 Gy in 5 fractions) to the prostate and seminal vesicles. The primary endpoint was the rate of grade 2+ genitourinary toxicity at 12 months using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 4.0. Secondary endpoints included patient-reported quality-of-life metrics (International Prostate Scoring System [IPSS], International Index of Erectile Function, and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-bowel). Biochemical failure was defined as prostate-specific antigen nadir +2 ng/mL. Posttreatment biopsies were performed at between 24 and 36 months; median follow-up was 36 months. Result(s): The rate of grade 2 urinary toxicity at 12 months was 25% with no grade 3 urinary toxicity noted. Mean IPSS at baseline and 12 and 24 months was 5, 10, and 6.2, respectively. Mean change in IPSS from baseline at 12 months was +5.5 (interquartile range, 1-9.75) and +1.05 (interquartile range, -3 to 3.25) at 24 months. Grade 2 bowel toxicity was 5% at 12 months with no grade 3 bowel toxicity noted. Mean Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-bowel domain scores at baseline and 12 months were 92.8 and 90.3, respectively. Of patients who were potent (International Index of Erectile Function >=21) at baseline, 75% remained potent at 12 months. Of 40 patients, 28 underwent posttreatment prostate biopsy (PPB), which was negative (n = 20) or demonstrated severe treatment effect (n = 8). No patient had a positive PPB or developed biochemical failure during the follow-up period. One patient without a PPB developed osseous metastases at 18 months posttreatment in the absence of biochemical failure.

random-journal.pdf,ProP123,"A., Magli",2018,English,pro.p:#5,Magnetic resonance imaging-guided contouring in stereotactic body radiation therapy in localized disease prostate cancer: Preliminary results of a phase-II study,"Background/Aim: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been established as a safe and effective treatment for prostate cancer. The goal of prostate SBRT is to treat the entire prostate and proximal seminal vesicles, while limiting radiation dose to the adjacent critical structures, including the bladder, rectum, and membranous urethra. Since the prostate apex is commonly involved with cancer, under-dosing this region would likely increase the risk of recurrence. MRI imaging better defines the prostate and reduces the overall target volume compared to Computed Tomography (CT) imaging. In addition, the prostatic-rectal and prostatic-bladder interfaces are better defined by MRI than by CT imaging. Furthermore, the more accurate delineation of the prostatic apex allows for dose reduction to the genitourinary diaphragm (GUD). A phase-II study of SBRT for localized prostate cancer at low-/intermediate- risk (according to NCCN score) and risk of lymph node involvement <17% (Roach Index) was carried out between November 2015 and July 2017. In this report, the preliminary results in terms of acute toxicity are documented. Material(s) and Method(s): This is a prospective analysis of 30 patients treated with SBRT using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique. The plans were created by the EclipseTM Treatment Planning System (ver. 10, Varian Medical Systems). Dose distributions were calculated using a 6-MV beam and the AAA dose calculation algorithm. The SBRT-VMAT plans were set up with two full arc arrangements. The prescription dose was 36.25 Gy, administered in 5 fractions; assuming alpha/beta 1.5 Gy, it corresponded to a biologically effective dose (BED) to the prostate equal to 211.5 Gy. The gross tumor volume (GTV) (prostate with the 1/3 proximal seminal vesicles) was delineated using the MRI T2-weighted (T2w) and FLAIR images, co-registered with planning-CT images. Our local rigid registration method employed the 3 intraprostatic gold fiducial markers (GFM) as landmarks. The GTV was delineated also on CT-images and compared to MR-based GTV, by using the DICE metric. All patients were contoured under the supervision of the same physician (AM). For the planning, an isotropic margin of 6 mm around the MR-based GTV is added to obtain the planning tumor volume (PTV). To study the potential association to the bladder trigone on long-term urinary function, the bladder trigone was MRbased contoured too. An indwelling catheter was inserted to aid in the delineation of the urethra. The request for prescription dose was (V100%)>95% of the PTV. According to our internal protocol, minimum dose (98%) to PTV > 97%, and maximum dose (2%) <110% of the prescribed dose were recommended. The rectal dose- volume goals were V50% <50%, V80% <20%, V90 <10%, V100% <5%. The bladder dose-limits were V50% <40%, V92.4% <12.7%, and V100% <10%. Concerning the urethra and the trigone, the constraints for the maximum dose (Dmax) were Dmax<39.9 Gy and Dmax<38.9 Gy, respectively. The image-guided radiotherapy protocol was based on 3 intraprostatic fiducial markers, with daily online checks by cone beam computed tomography. The acute toxicity gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) were recorded using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer scale. Additional data are collected by means of International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaires. Result(s): Between November 2015 and July 2017, 30 patients were enrolled in this prospective study; the median follow-up duration was 6 months (range, 3-18 months). The median age was 74 years (range=60-81). The mean target registration error was 0.05+/-0.02 mm (SD). The CT-contoured prostate resulted on average 35% larger that the true gland (MR-based volume) with a mean DICE coefficient of 0.79 (range=0.61-0.90), such that posterior portions were always missed and anterior normal tissue always included. The requests for coverage of the PTV were accomplished for all the VMAT plans; dose constraints for each organ at risk were largely fulfilled. Acute GU and GE toxicity of grade 2 were observed in 26% and 10% patients respectively. The patients presented with urinary obstructive symptoms before radiation treatment had a slight increase in the severity of their symptoms, with the complete recovery at 3 months from the end of the radiotherapy. Conclusion(s): The present study showed an important reduction in volume of MR-guided prostate, in agreement with literature data. These reductions are primarily due to reduced variation at the superior and inferior extent of the prostate, and translate into reductions in delivered dose to the rectum. This improved soft tissue visualization on MRI has also been shown to reduce interobserver variation in prostate contouring. The dosimetric data of these first 30 patients are favorable for both target coverage and organs at risk dose limits, indicating that SBRTVMAT planning in conjunction with MRI-based prostate is safe for localized prostate cancer patients at low- or intermediate-risk. Our preliminary moderate acute toxicity results were consistent with these dosimetric data. Finally, despite these encouraging results, longer follow-up periods are necessary to confirm them.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,,,,

The health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes using this novel approach are important in shared decision making for patients. Objective(s): To report HRQoL using both patient- and clinician-reported outcomes at 1 yr following stereotactic MRgRT for patients with localized PC. Design, setting, and participants: A prospective phase 2 trial included 101 patients with localized PC. Intervention(s): All patients received 36.25 Gy in five fractions of MRgRT delivered within 2 wk. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: HRQoL was prospectively assessed at baseline, at the last fraction, at 6 wk, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 mo after treatment, by patient-reported outcome measures using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25 questionnaires, and International Prostate Symptom Score. At the same time points, clinicians reported on symptomatic adverse events (AEs). Effect sizes for changes in HRQoL were calculated with repeated measures analysis of variance. Results and limitations: Availability of HRQoL data exceeded 95% at all study time points. From both questionnaires and the recorded AEs, the largest treatment effects on urinary and bowel symptoms were recorded in the first 6 wk of follow-up. Thereafter, all symptoms decreased and returned to baseline values at 12 mo. No grade >=3 toxicity was reported. No patient reported any relevant limitation due to urinary symptoms, and only 2.2% of patients reported a relevant impact on daily activities due to bowel problems at 1 yr. The majority of patients had intermediate- or high-risk PC for which androgen deprivation therapy (83.2%) was prescribed, thereby precluding study of MRgRT on sexual function. Longer follow-up is awaited in order to evaluate the oncological outcome. Conclusion(s): Delivery of MRgRT for SBRT resulted in low toxicity at 1 yr. Patient Summary: All patients completed magnetic resonance-guided radiation therapy, which was well tolerated with only transient early urinary and bowel symptoms, which resolved 1 yr after treatment, as confirmed by patient-reported outcome measures. The current study in patients with prostate cancer, stereotactic magnetic resonance-guided radiotherapy for optimal target coverage allowed the use of small planning margins, which may account for the low patient- and clinician-reported toxicity rates at 1-yr follow-up.Copyright © 2020 European Association of Urology",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.euo.2020.05.007,,,

A key obstacle is the traditional paradigm in which therapies with significant benefit in mCRPC are then studied in patients (pts) with localized, rising PSA or early metastatic disease using time-to-event (TTE) outcomes (e.g. biochemical recurrence, radiographic progression or death). These trials are costly, lengthy and often give inconclusive results that do not change practice nor provide a methodology to rank regimens based on efficacy. A new strategy is needed that gives a rapid efficacy readout and prioritizes approaches for large-scale testing. Method(s):Metacure is a multi-arm, multi-stage randomized Phase 2 trial in which novel systemic therapies are studied in the context of a multimodality approach, which includes radical prostatectomy + pelvic and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, if applicable, stereotactic radiotherapy (RT) to osseous metastases, and an option for adjuvant RT based on risk factors. The arms include combinations of ADT + apalutamide +/- abiraterone acetate and prednisone. Non-castrate prostate cancer pts with high probability of relapse or death from disease ranging from very high risk localized to low-volume metastatic disease are eligible. The primary endpoint is pathologic complete response and minimal residual disease. The secondary endpoint is undetectable PSA with non-castrate levels of testosterone. Both are binary endpoints that circumvent interpretations of the clinical relevance of TTE outcomes, providing a read-out of success or failure in a shorter time frame with fewer pts. The uniform entry criteria and continuous randomization enables ranking and prioritization of the strategies evaluated for further development in large-scale trials so that only the most effective ones move forward. This multicenter trial is managed by the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium, funded by Janssen and is currently open and actively accruing.

However, there is a lack of data on surgical MDT in visceral/skeletal oligometastatic prostate cancer (PCa). We aimed to assess the role of surgical excision of visceral and skeletal PCa recurrence. METHODS: Seventeen PCa patients experienced metachronous visceral or skeletal oligometastatic recurrence following maximal local treatment. Oligometastatic recurrence was defined as 1-3 lesions, detected with the best imaging technique available at the time of diagnosis. All patients underwent metastasectomy and were followed for a median of 43 months. Postoperative complications were graded using the Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications. Kaplan-Meier plots were used to assess overall survival. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (82%) had visceral lesions, two had bone lesions (12%), and one had an abdominal wall metastasis (6%). Four patients (24%) were under active ADT at the time of metastasectomy. PSA decreased after metastasectomy in 16 (94%) patients. Ten (77%) of the 13 ADT-naïve patients had a PSA decrease of ≥ 50%. Following metastasectomy, 16 (94.1%) patients developed metastatic recurrence of which 11 (64.7%) were again oligometastatic, amenable for repeated MDT. The median time to metastatic recurrence was 14 months (range 6.4-40). We observed 8% Clavien-Dindo grade 3-4 complications in 21 procedures. CONCLUSIONS: In this report, we analyzed the outcomes of surgical excision of visceral and skeletal PCa recurrence following primary treatment. We found that removing metastasis to the bone and viscera can be associated with long-term disease-free periods at a low rate of serious complications.

The primary aim of this approach is to prolong disease free survival and delay the initiation of systemic therapies. This retrospective study is aimed to analyse local control, biochemical progression-free survival (b-PFS), toxicity and systemic therapy-free survival in a cohort of patients treated by a single clinician. Method(s): Eighteen patients (26 lesions) in patients with relapsed oligometastatic prostate cancer (1-3 sites) were treated with SABR, delivered using both cyberknife and VMAT. Doses used were 24 Gy in 2 or 3 fractions for spine and 30-40 Gy in 3 fractions for lymph nodes and other bony metastases. All patients had either a Choline or PSMA-PET scan prior to treatment. Response was assessed with PSA testing and repeat scanning when feasible. CTCAE acute and late toxicity was prospectively recorded. Result(s): Mean age was 68. Previous treatments for the primary prostate cancer included surgery (7 patients), surgery and salvage prostate bed radiotherapy (6 patients), radical radiotherapy (4 patients) and cryotherapy (1 patient). Twelve patients had a single metastatic site, four patients had 2 sites and two patients had 3 sites. Six patients patients were treated with a short course of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in addition to SABR. All patients had a fall in PSA with a mean reduction of 75%. Median pre-SABR PSA was 1.83ug/L and median post-SABR PSA was 0.28ug/L At a median follow-up of 14 months (range 2-28.5), 14 patients (78%) remained systemic therapy free. Three patients with a single pelvic lymph node metastases achieved a sustained undetectable PSA level. All 8 patients who had a post-treatment PET scan showed no residual activity at the treated site. One patient experienced G2 acute bowel toxicity, otherwise there was no toxicity above G1. Conclusion(s): MDT using SABR for relapsed prostate cancer is a safe treatment with promising results in terms of local control, b-PFS and delaying the initiation of systemic therapies.

A subgroup of those patients with mCRPC presents with oligoprogressive disease, with a limited number of progressive lesions while other metastases are still controlled by ongoing systemic treatment. METHODS: In this single arm prospective phase II trial, we aim to include 18 patients with oligoprogressive mCRPC (1-3 metastases and/or local recurrence) who will be treated with metastasis-directed therapy to all visible progressive lesions. Progression is based on conventional imaging, as the use of PSMA PET-CT is considered investigational. However all patients will undergo PSMA PET-CT and the images will be blinded until progression. Primary endpoint is the postponement of the start of next-line systemic treatment (NEST) and the additional clinical value of PSMA PET-CT. Recruitment of patients for this trial started in January 2020 and will be completed approximately by December 2020. DISCUSSION: In this phase 2 trial on oligoprogressive mCRPC, we will investigate the benefit of progression-directed therapy while continuing ongoing systemic treatment. We hypothesize that progression-directed therapy (PDT) with surgery or stereotactic body radiation therapy for these oligoprogressive lesions will postpone the start of next-line systemic treatment and therefore serve as a new or add-on therapy in the spectrum of treatments available for mCRPC. The results of this trial will serve as guidance for a later randomized phase 3 trial. All participants are given an information sheet and are required to give written informed consent. Results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

In a multivariable analysis, patients with one LN at recurrence had longer aMFS after ENRT (hazard ratio: 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.30-0.85, p = 0.009). Late toxicity was higher after ENRT compared with that after SBRT (16% vs. 5%, p < 0.01). Limitations include higher use of hormone therapy in the ENRT cohort and nonstandardized follow-up.random-journal.pdf,

random-journal.pdf,Conclusions: ENRT reduces the number of nodal recurrences as compared with SBRT, however at higher toxicity. Our findings hypothesize that ENRT should be preferred to SBRT in the treatment of nodal oligorecurrences. This hypothesis needs to be evaluated in a randomized trial.random-journal.pdf,

Evidence suggests that radiation-associated toxicity can be predicted by patient-specific germ-line biomarkers. We hypothesized that we could apply microRNA-based germ-line biomarkers that would predict toxicity to prostate SBRT, and that they would be distinct from microRNA-based biomarkers predicting toxicity to CF-RT (submitted), affording the opportunity for guided treatment selection. Materials/Methods: Patients enrolled on two prospective phase II studies (NCT01059513 and NCT02296229) who received SBRT to the prostate only (8 Gy x 5) were included (n=93). DNA was extracted from blood, FFPE tissue or saliva, and a panel of microRNA-based germ-line mutations were evaluated. Machine learning techniques were used to simultaneously identify prognostic features and perform classification of the biomarkers. For each of the methods, 10-fold cross validation was used to assess its performance and generality. Four classifiers were studied: logistic regression with lasso regularization (LASSO-LR), deep classification tree (DT), random forest (RF) and boosted trees (BT), with corresponding hyper-parameters being regularization weights (LASSO-LR), split and node level (DT), number of trees (RF), and learning rate/tree level/splits (BT). We then developed a treatment support system to predict toxicity risk to SBRT versus CF-RT. Result(s): Of the 93 SBRT patients, 16 (17.2%) had Grade >=2 late (LT) GU and GI toxicity, but only 3 (3%) had acute Grade >=2 toxicity, thus we focused on LT toxicity. Using DT we were able to predict LT GI and GU toxicity with a sensitivity of >96%, specificity >88%, AUC >93%, accuracy >95%, PPV >99%, NPV> 78%, and an F1 score of >97%. There was little overlap between biomarkers predicting LT GI verses GU toxicity for SBRT, and little overlap between biomarkers predicting LT GI or GU toxicity to SBRT versus CF-RT. Based on a patient's biomarker profile we performed toxicity prediction for each regimen (SBRT versus CF-RT) in parallel and assessed the likelihood of toxicity associated with each option. We could stratify patients into 3 subgroups: a subcohort whose toxicity outcome (either positive or negative) is indifferent to the treatment regimen (~85%), a cohort where SBRT is safer than CF-RT (~5%), and a cohort where CF-RT is safer than SBRT (~10%). Conclusion(s): We have identified a microRNA-based germ-line biomarker signature that is able to predict LT GI and GU toxicity to SBRT, which is different than that predicting LT toxicity to CF-RT, and developed a classifier that can stratify patients based on the risk for toxicity, possibly guiding treatment selection. Ongoing work is being done to further validate these findings prospectively.Copyright © 2019",exclusion,Other study design,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.06.459,,,
random-journal.pdf,ProP133,"T., Mee",2016,English,5 study;pro.p:#5,Modelled effects of hypofractionation on radiotherapy demand in England,"Purpose or Objective: Current clinical trials and studies are identifying hypofractionation as a viable treatment option when compared with current fractionation regimens. Our work estimates the reduction in the number of fractions prescribed and the potential effect on the overall demand for radiotherapy across the whole of England. With the evidence based estimates of demand for radiotherapy currently outstripping the supply capacity in England, this potential reduction in fraction demand needs to be calculated to assess the potential effects for radiotherapy service and infrastructure planning. Material(s) and Method(s): The Malthus Program, a tool for modelling radiotherapy demand, was used to calculate the potential effect of three hypofractionation studies/trials for the population of England. Well-published and potential clinical indications for hypofractionation have been modelled for prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and breast cancer. The hypofractionation indications for radiotherapy were mapped into the original Malthus clinical decision trees and simulations completed to study the effects of hypofractionation on demand. Result(s): If the CHHiP prostate trial achieves universal uptake throughout England then it has the potential to reduced radiotherapy demand by 3,500 fractions per million population (#pmp). SBRT for medically inoperable (or refusal of surgery) for stage 1 and stage 2 NSCLC has the potential to reduce the demand by a further 700 #pmp. The FAST-Forward trial, using 5# instead of 15# for T1-3 N0-1 M0 breast cancer has the potential to reduce demand by 4,600 #pmp. A potential reduction in modelled demand of 8,800 #pmp arises from these three studies alone. Across the total population of England, this translates to approximately 479,600 fractions per year. Conclusion(s): The current clinical indications and trials for hypofractionation have the potential to reduce the evidencebased estimates of demand of radiotherapy sufficiently to be achievable with a modest increase of the current levels of equipment in England. While the presented calculations are for England as a whole, the Malthus program offers the facility to calculate the changes in modelled demand at a regional level within England, enabling a more precise calculation for treatment centres and their local catchment.",exclusion,Other study design,,,,,,

To evaluate the acute toxicity of a phase II study concerning SBRT with a dose scheme of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions, in patients with localized prostate cancer at low/intermediate risk (according to NCCN score) and risk of lymph node involvement <17% ( Roach Index). Material and Methods This study dealt with a prospective analysis of the 30 patients treated with SBRT using VMAT technique. The GTV (prostate with the 1/3 proximal seminal vesicles) was delineated using the MR T2-weighted (T2w) and FLAIR images, co-registered with planning-CT images. Our local rigid registration method employed the 3 intraprostatic gold fiducial markers (GFM) as landmarks. The GTV was delineated also on CT-images and compared to MR-based GTV, by using the DICE metric. All patients were contoured under the supervision of the same physician (AM). For the planning, an isotropic margin of 6 mm around the MR-based GTV is added to obtain the PTV. To study the potential association to the bladder trigone on long-term urinary function, the bladder trigone was MR-based contoured too. An indwelling catheter was inserted to aid in the delineation of the urethra. The request for dose prescription is that V100%>95% of the PTV. The rectal dose-volume goals were V50% <50%, V80% <20%, V90<10%, V100%<5%. The bladder dose-volume goals were V50% <40%, V92.4% < 12.7%, V100% <10%. Concerning the urethra and the trigone, the constraints for the maximum dose (Dmax) were Dmax<39.9 Gy and Dmax<38.9 Gy, respectively. The IGRT protocol is based on 3 intraprostatic fiducial markers, with daily online checks by CBCT. The acute toxicity gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) were recorded using the RTOG/EORTC scale. Additional data are collected by means of I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) - IIEF-5 (International Index of Erectile Function) questionnaires. Results Between November 2015 and July 2017, 30 patients were enrolled in this prospective study, the median follow-up duration was 6 months (range, 3-18 months). The median age was 74 years (range, 60-81 years). The mean target registration error was 0.3+/-0.2 mm (1SD). The CTcontoured prostate resulted on average 35% larger that the true gland (MR-based volume) with a mean DICE coefficient of 0.79 (range: 0.61-0.90), such that posterior portions were always missed and anterior normal tissue always included. For the dose distributions of the organs at risk, all the dose constraints were largely satisfied. Acute GU and GE toxicity of grade 2 were observed in 26% and 10% patients respectively. The quality of life assessment showed a complete recovery of obstructive symptoms 3 months from the end of the radiotherapy. Conclusion Our study showed an important reduction in volume of MR-guided prostate, in agreement with literature data. This allows safe high dose per fraction prostate with limited acute toxicities.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,,,,
random-journal.pdf,ProP136,"Finkelstein, S E",2016,English,pro.p,Multicenter assessment of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) boost in intermediate-risk prostate cancer: Biochemical failure and toxicity,"Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) offers promise as a developing standard of care for localized prostate cancer. As compared to a conventional schedule, hypofractionated treatment may produce higher tumor control rates while maintaining an equivalent biologic effective dose (BED) to normal tissues for late effects and reducing BED for acute effects. Most previous single institution studies have specifically focused on patients with low risk prostate cancer with limited data available in intermediate (IRPC) or high risk prostate cancer. We describe toxicity and biochemical progression free survival outcomes of linear accelerator based SBRT boost for IRPC. Materials/Methods: This is a multi-center (9) retrospective review of prospectively collected data for a total of 60 patients; thirty-eight patients (63%) were treated on an IRB approved prospective trial. IRPC patients that included clinical stage T2b (7%) or PSA > 10 ng/ml and < 20 ng/ml (25%) or Gleason score of 7 (82%), received 45 Gy of IMRT in 25 fractions followed by a SBRT boost of 5.5 Gy per fraction for 4 fractions. Cone beam CT image guidance was used prior to each fraction for correction of target setup error. Twenty-three percent of patients received concomitant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT); forty-six patients (77%) deferred concomitant ADT. NCI CTCAE v3.0 was used to assess urinary and rectal toxicity at baseline, during treatment, and then at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months after treatment. Biochemical determinations were made at concurrent follow up time points. IPSS and IEFF scores were also obtained at baseline and at follow up. Result(s): Median follow up was 21.5 months (range 2.9-87.2). No patient (0%) had a biochemical failure, using the combined ASTRO Phoenix definition. Mean PSA (ng/ml) at baseline was 8.5; 2.9 at 1, 1.7 at 3, 1.3 at 6, 0.8 at 9, 1.0 at 12, 0.7 at 18, 0.4 at 24, 0.3 at 30 months after treatment respectively. With respect to toxicity, Grade 3-5 Genitourinary (GU) toxicity was 3%, with 2 patients experiencing grade 3 (3%), and no patient experiencing grade 4 or 5 toxicity. The most common GU toxicity was urinary frequency/urgency, experienced by 35% of patients at baseline, peaking during treatment to 65%, declining to 24% by 12 months and thereafter remaining stable. Grade 3-5 Gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was 2%, with 1 patient experiencing grade 3 (2%), and no grade 4 or 5 toxicity. Diarrhea was the most common side effect seen, 24% during treatment, all Grade 1. This toxicity resolved rapidly, with 4% at 12 months and 0% thereafter. Conclusion(s): Linear accelerator based SBRT boost for IRPC produces a rapid biochemical response with favorable urinary and rectal toxicity following treatment. Interestingly, a clinically significant number of patients had GU symptoms at baseline which improved over time. Further followup is needed to determine long-term toxicity and disease control outcomes.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2016.06.1331,,,
random-journal.pdf,ProP137,"Jiang, Naomi Y",2019,eng,pro.p,Multi-Institutional Analysis of Prostate-Specific Antigen Kinetics After Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy.,"PURPOSE: Understanding prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics after radiation therapy plays a large role in the management of patients with prostate cancer (PCa). This is particularly true in establishing expectations regarding PSA nadir (nPSA) and PSA bounces, which can be disconcerting. As increasingly more patients are being treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for low- and intermediate-risk PCa, it is imperative to understand the PSA response to SBRT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: PSA data from 5 institutions were retrospectively analyzed for patients with localized PCa treated definitively with SBRT alone from 2004 to 2016. Patients received 35 to 40 Gy in 5 fractions, per institutional standards. Patients who had less than 12 months of PSA data or received androgen deprivation therapy were excluded from this study. Linear and logistic multivariable analysis were performed to identify predictors of nPSA, bounce, and biochemical recurrence, and joint latent class models were developed to identify significant predictors of time to biochemical failure. RESULTS: A total of 1062 patients were included in this study. Median follow-up was 66 months (interquartile range [IQR], 36.4-89.9 months). Biochemical failure per the Phoenix criteria occurred in 4% of patients. Median nPSA was 0.2 ng/mL, median time to nPSA was 40 months, 84% of patients had an nPSA ≤0.5 ng/mL, and 54% of patients had an nPSA ≤0.2 ng/mL. On multivariable analysis, nPSA was a significant predictor of biochemical failure. Benign PSA bounce was noted in 26% of patients. The median magnitude of PSA bounce was 0.52 ng/mL (IQR, 0.3-1.0 ng/mL). Median time to PSA bounce was 18.1 months (IQR, 12.0-31.1 months). On multivariable analysis, age and radiation dose were significantly associated with a lower incidence of bounce. Joint latent class models modeling found that nPSA and radiation dose were significantly associated with longer time to biochemical failure. CONCLUSIONS: In this multi-institutional cohort of patients with long-term follow-up, we found that SBRT led to low nPSAs. In turn, lower nPSAs are associated with reduced incidence of, and longer time to, biochemical failure. Benign PSA bounces occurred in a quarter of patients, as late as several years after treatment. Further studies are needed to directly compare the PSA response of patients who receive SBRT versus other treatment modalities.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.06.2539,,,

We report outcomes of a multi-institutional phase 2 clinical trial of high-dose SBRT for LR and IR PCa patients following placement of a peri-rectal hydrogel spacer. Materials/Methods: Eligible patients included men with localized PCa with Gleason score 6-7, PSA <=15, and clinical/radiographic stage <= T2c. Patients underwent hydrogel spacer placement followed by 45 Gy in five fractions to the prostate only; concurrent hormone therapy was not used. Primary endpoints were reduction in the rate of rectal erosion/ulcer events within 9 months and rates of peri-rectal space creation >= 7.5 mm. Potential rectal erosion/ulceration was assessed at 1.5, 3, 6, and 9 months posttreatment by direct anoscopy. Toxicity using Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events v.4.0, quality of life, dosimetric outcomes, and oncologic outcomes data were collected. The proposed study had >90% power to detect significant reduction in mucosal injury rate from the observed rate of 90% in the preceding Phase 1/2 clinical trial to < 70% (alphaZ0.05, two-sided exact test). Result(s): A total of 44 patients treated at 2 institutions were included; 7 patients (15.9%) had Gleason 6(3+3) PCa, 25 (56.8%) had Gleason 7(3+4) PCa, and 12 (27.3%) had Gleason 7(4+3) PCa. Median PSA at treatment was 6.5 (range 1.7-13.5). All patients received protocol therapy; overall rate of dosimetry noncompliance was 1.8%. A total of 6 rectal erosions/ulcers (five grade 1, one grade 2) were observed (13.6%), meeting the trial's primary objective. All of them were minimally symptomatic and resolved on repeat anoscopy within 6 months. Median space creation was 11.5 mm; only 1 spacer (2.3%) did not meet the protocol goal of >=7.5mm of space created, but overall trial endpoint was met with >95% of patients with spacer distance of >= 7.5mm. At a median follow-up of 12 months, freedom from biochemical failure was 100%. There were no >= Grade 3 acute or chronic gastrointestinal toxicities. Acute and late urinary Grade 3 toxicities occurred in 2 (4.5%) of patients; one spacer site infection and one urinary tract pain, both resolved. No >Grade 3 toxicities occurred. Conclusion(s): This is the first prospective study to evaluate the efficacy of hydrogel spacer for patients undergoing SBRT for PCa. Hydrogel spacer placement prior to high-dose SBRT treatment for PCa significantly reduces rectal erosion/ulcer events. This is expected to reduce long-term rectal toxicity; there are no high-grade rectal events noted on study to date. Protocol patients will continue to be followed for toxicity, biochemical control, overall and disease specific survival, and quality of life outcomes.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,,,,

Method(s): The Registry for Prostate Cancer Radiosurgery (RPCR) was established in 2010 to further evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of prostate radiosurgery (SBRT) for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer. Men with prostate cancer were asked to voluntarily participate in the Registry. Demographic, baseline medical and treatment-related data were collected and stored electronically in a HIPAA-compliant database, maintained by Advertek, Inc. Enrolled men were asked to complete short, multiple choice questionnaires regarding their bowel, bladder and sexual function. Patient-reported outcome forms were collected at baseline and at regular intervals (every 3-6 months) following treatment. Serial PSA measurements were obtained at each visit and included in the collected data. Result(s): From July 2010 to July 2013, nearly 2,000 men from 45 participating sites were enrolled in the registry. The majority (86%) received radiosurgery as monotherapy. At 2 years follow-up, biochemical disease free survival was 92%. No Grade 3 late urinary toxicity was reported. One patient developed Grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity (rectal bleeding). Erectile function was preserved in 80% of men <70 yeats old. Overall compliance with data entry was 64%. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery is an alternative option to conventional radiotherapy for the treatment of organ-confined prostate cancer.

Given known advantages of hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT) to treat PCa (low a/b ratio), we conducted a phase II trial to escalate a high dose to mpMRI lesion(s) via Image-Guided (IG)-RT/Volumetric Arc Therapy (VMAT)/Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) technology. We present the acute toxicity results of this novel approach. Method(s): 22 pts with mpMRI lesion(s) were prospectively treated to a course of IGRT/VMAT to the prostate & seminal vesicle +/-pelvic lymph nodes (PLN) to a dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions followed by SBRT boost, 18 Gy in 3 fraction to the prostate with a simultaneous integrated boost 21 Gy in 3 fractions (EQD2 = 85.2 Gy using a/b 3 or 93.4 Gy using a/b 1.5) to the mpMRI prostatic lesion(s). Placement of 3 polymer based fiducial markers visible in both CT and MRI for image co-registration and treatment guidance was performed. Genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were scored using CTCAE v4. DSMC approved reporting of acute AE results prior to completion of trial accrual as an interim safety assessment prior to final trial accrual. Result(s): Median age was 66.5 years (range: 57-80). All patients had PI-RADS grade 3-5 mpMRI lesion(s); 41.0%, 45.4% and 13.6% having 1, 2 and 3 lesions respectively. Ten (45%) pts had Gleason Score (GS) 8-10 and 12 had GS 7 disease. Median PSA was 8.97 (range: 4.0-77.9). Eleven (50%), 10 (46%), and 1 (5%) pts had stage T1, T2, and T3 tumor, respectively. Nine pts received treatment to the PLN and 15 received androgen deprivation therapy. All patients completed the protocol treatment without reporting acute GI or GU AEs grade >=3 during treatment or at follow up. Grade 2 GI (diarrhea) and GU toxicity (frequency) was seen in 2 (9%) and 9 (41%) pts, respectively, during treatment. Of the 16 pts (71%) with least 3 months follow-up all grade 2 GI and 55.5% GU toxicities had resolved.

While metastasis-directed approaches are used for palliation, the primary goal of such treatment for patients with oligometastases is to prolong survival and the duration of cancer control. Metastasis-directed therapy, for patients with limited number of metastatic sites, has been practiced for decades, dating back to the era before chemotherapy was widely used. Systemic therapy has become the accepted standard of care for metastatic disease. And while not curative for most solid cancers, systemic therapy can delay cancer progression, prolong life, and maintain or improve quality of life, albeit often at the expense of toxicities which can adversely impact quality of life. From the 1960s to 1980s, prominent physicians questioned whether metastasis-directed resection or radiotherapy could potentially be curative treatment approaches. In 1995, Drs. Hellman and Weichselbaum wrote an editorial that coined the term ""oligometastases"" and refined the hypothesis of metastasis-directed surgical and radiotherapeutic treatments as potentially curative for select patients. Their article was the first to explicitly describe the clinical state of metastases existing along a spectrum, with a spectrum of behaviors (ranging from indolent disease confined to limited sites to widespread disease) and, therefore, a spectrum of potential treatments. In the ensuing decades, there were rapid technologic advancements in radiotherapy, including stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), which facilitated delivery of ablative doses of radiation to precisely and accurately targeted tumors. SBRT has been considered an optimal non-surgical approach to treat oligometastases, allowing for definitive-dose delivery and for targeting accuracy that minimizes normal tissue radiation exposure. In the early 2000s, many institutions began publishing prospective studies demonstrating favorable outcomes in patients with oligometastases treated with SBRT. Not answered in these single-arm studies was whether patients generally fared better than expected due to selection of patients with relatively indolent disease, or from metastasisdirected treatment. There is also a potential for immortal time bias with non-randomized comparisons. However, recent randomized phase II studies have suggested that SBRT for oligometastases is associated with improved survival outcomes. Phase III studies, many specific for certain cancers (i.e., breast, prostate or lung cancers) are accruing. Future work will be needed to identify which patients are most apt to benefit from metastasis-directed therapy; in addition to clinical factors, host and/or tumor genomics may prove to be prognostic. Metastasis-directed therapy may become more important with improvements in systemic therapy in controlling micrometastatic disease. Incorporating immunotherapy with SBRT may also be a promising approach, with SBRT perhaps augmenting the immune response. As personalized medicine evolves, patients with oligometastases will be better served. The history of oligometastases will continue to unfold.",exclusion,review,Llegir text complert per info sobre oligometastasis i referències sobre RCTs,PM113,http://dx.doi.org/10.21037/apm.2020.03.31,,,

We address this issue with prospectively collected progression and treatment data from the TROG 03.04 RADAR randomised controlled trial for men with locally advanced prostate cancer (PC). Methods Three Fine and Gray competing risk survival models with time-dependent covariates were used to determine whether metastatic progression status at first diagnosis of bony metastases, i.e. number of bony sites involved and presence of prior or simultaneous other sites of progression, impacts on prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) when adjusted for baseline prognostic factors and allocated primary treatment. Results Between 2003 and 2014, 176 of the 1071 subjects developed bone metastases, 152 developed other sites of progression and 91 died of PC. All subjects received secondary treatment using androgen suppression but none received extirpative treatments. The three models found evidence: 1 - of a clear prognostic gradient according to number of bony metastatic sites; 2 - that other sites of progression contributed to PCSM to a lesser extent than bone progression; and 3 - that further bony metastatic progression in men with up to 3 bony metastases had a major impact on PCSM. Conclusion Randomised trials are essential to determine the value of extirpative treatment for oligometastatic bony metastases due to PC.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",exclusion,Other tumor treated,,PM114,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2016.07.021,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seven-eight patients were treated with SBRT for isolated body metastasis. The most frequent primary tumor was prostate cancer (28.2%), followed by colorectal cancer (23.1%) and lung cancer (20.5%). Median age at diagnosis of oligometastatic disease was 70 years (range 47-88). Median Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) was 90 (range 70-100). The most common SBRT fractionation scheme was 5 × 7 Gy (total dose 35 Gy). Response to radiotherapy was determined according to RECIST criteria v1.1. Toxicity was registered according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. The survival analysis was performed with the Kaplan-Meier method. The correlation between time actuarial incidence and clinical parameters was studied, and the Kaplan-Meier method of log-rank test was applied. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 22.68 months, local control was achieved in 89.7% of the cases. The two-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 68% and 42%, respectively. On univariate analysis, KPS ≥80 is predictive for improved OS (p = .001) and PFS (p = .001). Acute toxicity of grade ≥2 occurred in eight (10.2%) patients and late grade ≥2 toxicity in five (6.4%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ablative radiotherapy in 'early oligometastatic state' is a safe, effective and minimally invasive treatment modality.

However, those studies have been performed staging patients with Choline-PET. Our hypothesis is that these results can be improved using 68Ga-PSMA PET/ CT, which has demonstrated better accuracy in patients with BCR at low PSA levels, where the probability of oligometastatic disease is higher . The aim of this communication was to assess the efficacy of SBRT based on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in patients with BCR. Material(s) and Method(s): This is a retrospective analysis of a monocentric cohort of PCa patients diagnosed with oligometastatic disease based on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT findings and treated with RT. Inclusion criteria were: histologically proven PCa, BCR after local treatment with curative intent (surgery, radiotherapy or both) and 3 or less metastatic lesions. Number and localization of metastatic sites where registered. MRI and CT coregistration were used for SBRT planning. In order to evaluate its efficacy , biochemical response was defined as a decrease of >50% of PSA (PSA50) measured at 1 and 4 months after SBRT. Patients were followed-up until progression. Result(s): From a total cohort of 45 patients treated with RT based on 68Ga -PSMA PET/ CT results, 15 met the inclusion criteria. Median PSA value at the time of the scan was 2.06ng/ml. A total of 22 PSMA positive lesions were treated: 13/22 (59%) lymph nodes, 6/22 (27%) bone lesions and 3/22 (14%) lung lesions. Only 1/15 (7%) patients had a biochemical response (PSA50) at 1 month while 8/11 (73%) patients presented a biochemical response at 4 months of follow- up . At the moment of this communication 4 patients are still responding at 1 year follow-up with no androgen deprivation therapy needed. Conclusion(s): Retrospective study preliminary results suggest SBRT based on 68Ga -PSMA PET/CT to be an effective treatment in patients with PCa oligometastatic disease. Biochemical response seems to be uncomplete at 1 month and should therefore be evaluated at earliest 4 months after SBRT. Future studies measuring outcome of SBRT based on 68Ga -PSMA PET/CT should be confronted to those using other imaging techniques.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,PM117,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00259-017-3822-1,,,
random-journal.pdf,ProP145,"S., Tran",2017,English,pro.m,Oligorecurrent nodal prostate cancer: Longterm results of an elective nodal irradiation approach,"Purpose or Objective The best strategy to irradiate oligorecurrent nodal prostate cancer (PCa) remains debated with both elective nodal radiotherapy (ENRT) and SBRT considered valid alternatives. Aim of this study is to report long-term results of ENRT in PCa patients (pts) with oligorecurrent nodal disease after primary treatment. Material and Methods Data of 53 oligorecurrent PCa pts (N1 and/or M1a) with <= 5 nodal metastases (n=108) treated with ENRT combined with androgen deprivation (AD) between 2004 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Median age and PSA at diagnosis were 62 yrs (range, 47-77) and 8.6 ng/ml (range, 3.4-92.9 ng/ml), respectively. The primary treatment was RT, radical prostatectomy (RP), RP + postoperative RT and RT + salvage RP in 9 (17%), 23 (43%), 20 (38%) and 1 (2%) pts, respectively. At recurrence (median time after primary treatment of 34 mo, range 2-129 mo), all but one patient were re-staged with 18F-choline PET-CT studies. Median PSA and PSA doubling time (DT) were 3.4 ng/ml (0.2-48.9 ng/ml) and 5 mo (range, 1-35 mo), respectively. At restaging, 45.3% (n=24) of the pts presented a single nodal metastasis, while 2, 3, 4 and 5 nodal metastases were found in 30% (n=16), 7.5% (n=4), 9.5% (n=5) and 7.5% (n=4) of the pts, respectively. Recurrences were mainly located in the pelvis (n=38). A combined N1 and M1a oligorecurrence or extrapelvic nodal progression (M1a) was observed in 10 and 5 pts, respectively. All pts underwent ENRT between 45 and 50.4 Gy with a boost on positive nodes (median 64.4 Gy, 54-69 Gy) using mainly VMAT (n=24) or IMRT (n=21) techniques. Concomitant AD was administered to all pts for a median time of 6mo (range, 3-30 mo). Results After a median follow-up (FU) after ENRT of 44 mo (range, 2-133), 27 pts (51%) showed PSA progression, with a 5-yr biochemical disease free-survival of 43+/-8.3%. The 5-yr distant progression-free survival (DPFS) rate was 58.2+/-8.5% (n=19 pts with clinical progression). Pts with a PSA DT at relapse <3 mo showed a worse 5-yr DPFS compared to pts with a PSA DT >= 3mo (36.8% vs. 63.6%, p=0.029), while a trend towards significance was observed for pts with 1 vs >= 2 recurrent nodes (71.8% vs. 44.9%, p=0.089). Overall survival rate at 5-yr was 86.4+/-6.9% (2 over 4 pts died from PCa). Ten of 19 clinically relapsing pts presented a new oligometastatic progression (7 nodal/2 bone/1 combined). One patient presented a local relapse in the previously untreated prostate bed. Eight out 10 pts were treated with a new RT course, with 3 pts in complete remission at last FU. Only 2 pts presented with a CTCAE v3.0 Grade >=2 genitourinary toxicity. Conclusion ENRT combined with concomitant short-course AD is a safe and effective salvage modality for patients with oligorecurrent nodal PCa, able to better delay distant progression compared to historical series using focal SBRT.

METHODS: Between 2012 and 2015, a total of 170 PCa patients were randomized to 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions (6.5 Gy × 5 to the urethra) delivered either every other day (EOD, arm A, n = 84) or once a week (QW, arm B, n = 86). Genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (CTCAE v4.0 scale), IPSS, and QoL scores were assessed at baseline, at the 5th fraction (5fx), 12th weeks (12W), and every 6 months after SBRT. The primary endpoint was biochemical control at 18 months and grade ≥ 3 toxicity (including grade ≥ 2 for urinary obstruction/retention) during the first 3 months. RESULTS: Among the 165 patients analyzed, the toxicity stopping rule was never activated during the acute phase. Maximum acute grade 2 GU toxicity rates at 5fx were 17% and 19% for arms A and B, respectively, with only 2 cases of grade 2 GI toxicity at 5fx in arm A. At month 18, grade ≥ 2 GU and GI toxicity decreased below 5% and 2% for both arms. No changes in EORTC QLQ-PR25 scores for GU, GI, and sexual domains were observed in both arms between baseline and month 18. Four biochemical failures were observed, 2 in each arm, rejecting the null hypothesis of an unfavorable response rate ≤ 85% in favor of an acceptable ≥ 95% rate. CONCLUSIONS: At 18 months, urethra-sparing SBRT showed a low toxicity profile, with minimal impact on QoL and favorable biochemical control rates, regardless of overall treatment time (EOD vs QW).",exclusion,Not the right comparator,,,10.1002/cam4.2966,,,

We completed a multicentre, randomized phase II study to investigate the impact of overall treatment time on quality of life (QOL). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Men with low and intermediate-risk prostate cancer were randomly assigned to 40 Gy in 5 fractions delivered once per week (QW) vs. every other day (EOD). QOL was assessed using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite. The primary endpoint was the proportion with a minimum clinically important change (MCIC) in bowel QOL during the acute (≤12 week) period, and analysis was by intention-to-treat. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01423474. RESULTS: 152 men from 3 centres were randomized with median follow-up of 47 months. Patients treated QW had superior acute bowel QOL with 47/69 (68%) reporting a MCIC compared to 63/70 (90%) treated EOD (p = 0.002). Fewer patients treated QW reported moderate-severe problems with bowel QOL during the acute period compared with EOD (14/70 [20%] vs. 40/70 [57%], p < 0.001). Acute urinary QOL was also better in the QW arm, with 52/67 (78%) vs 65/69 (94%) experiencing a MCIC (p = 0.006). There were no significant differences in late urinary or bowel QOL at 2 years or last follow-up. CONCLUSION: Prostate SBRT delivered QW improved acute bowel and urinary QOL compared to EOD. Patients should be counselled regarding the potential for reduced short-term toxicity and improved QOL with QW prostate SBRT.",exclusion,Not the right comparator,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2018.02.029,,,
random-journal.pdf,ProP149,"Zilli, Thomas",2018,eng,pro.p:#5,"ONE SHOT - single shot radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer: Study protocol of a single arm, multicenter phase I/II trial","Background: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an emerging treatment alternative for patients with localized prostate cancer. Promising results in terms of disease control and toxicity have been reported with 4 to 5 SBRT fractions. However, question of how far can the number of fractions with SBRT be reduced is a challenging research matter. As already explored by some authors in the context of brachytherapy, monotherapy appears to be feasible with an acceptable toxicity profile and a promising outcome. The aim of this multicenter phase I/II prospective trialis to demonstrate early evidence of safety and efficacy of a single-fraction SBRT approach for the treatment of localized disease. Method(s): Patients with low- and intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer without significant tumor in the transitional zone will be treated with a single SBRT fraction of 19 Gy to the whole prostate gland with urethra-sparing (17 Gy). Intrafractional motion will be monitored with intraprostatic electromagnetic transponders. The primary endpoint of the phase I part of the study will be safety as assessed by CTCAE 4.03 grading scale, while biochemical relapse-free survival will be the endpoint for the phase II. The secondary endpoints include acute and late toxicity, quality of life, progression-free survival, and prostate-cancer specific survival. Discussion(s): This is the first multicenter phase I/II trial assessing the efficacy and safety of a single-dose SBRT treatment for patients with localized prostate cancer. If positive, results of ONE SHOT may help to design subsequent phase III trials exploring the role of SBRT monotherapy in the exclusive radiotherapy treatment of localized disease.

Objective(s): To determine if stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) improves oncologic outcomes in men with oligometastatic prostate cancer. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): The Observation vs Stereotactic Ablative Radiation for Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer (ORIOLE) phase 2 randomized study accrued participants from 3 US radiation treatment facilities affiliated with a university hospital from May 2016 to March 2018 with a data cutoff date of May 20, 2019, for analysis. Of 80 men screened, 54 men with recurrent hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and 1 to 3 metastases detectable by conventional imaging who had not received ADT within 6 months of enrollment or 3 or more years total were randomized. Intervention(s): Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive SABR or observation. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was progression at 6 months by prostate-specific antigen level increase, progression detected by conventional imaging, symptomatic progression, ADT initiation for any reason, or death. Predefined secondary outcomes were toxic effects of SABR, local control at 6 months with SABR, progression-free survival, Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form)-measured quality of life, and concordance between conventional imaging and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-Targeted positron emission tomography in the identification of metastatic disease. Result(s): In the 54 men randomized, the median (range) age was 68 (61-70) years for patients allocated to SABR and 68 (64-76) years for those allocated to observation. Progression at 6 months occurred in 7 of 36 patients (19%) receiving SABR and 11 of 18 patients (61%) undergoing observation (P =.005). Treatment with SABR improved median progression-free survival (not reached vs 5.8 months; hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11-0.81; P =.002). Total consolidation of PSMA radiotracer-Avid disease decreased the risk of new lesions at 6 months (16% vs 63%; P =.006). No toxic effects of grade 3 or greater were observed. T-cell receptor sequencing identified significant increased clonotypic expansion following SABR and correlation between baseline clonality and progression with SABR only (0.082085 vs 0.026051; P =.03). Conclusions and Relevance: Treatment with SABR for oligometastatic prostate cancer improved outcomes and was enhanced by total consolidation of disease identified by PSMA-Targeted positron emission tomography. SABR induced a systemic immune response, and baseline immune phenotype and tumor mutation status may predict the benefit from SABR. These results underline the importance of prospective randomized investigation of the oligometastatic state with integrated imaging and biological correlates.

Large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown moderately hypofractionated regimens (2.5-3 Gy/fraction(f)) as non-inferior to conventionally fractionated regimens (2 Gy/f). PACE-B aims to demonstrate non-inferiority of SBRT compared to CFMHRT for biochemical or clinical failure. Compared to CFMHRT, SBRT reduces patient (pt) attendances but compressed overall treatment time may influence acute toxicity severity. Method(s): PACE is a phase III open-label multiple-cohort RCT. Men with LPCa, stage T1-T2, <= Gleason 3 + 4, PSA <= 20 ng/mL, unsuitable for surgery or preferring EBRT, were eligible for the PACE-B cohort. Between 08/12-01/18, 874 pts (38 centres) were randomised (1:1) to SBRT or CFMHRT. SBRT dose was 36.25 Gy/5f in 1-2 weeks (wks), CFMHRT as 78 Gy/39f over 7.5 wks, or 62 Gy/20f in 4 wks. Androgen deprivation therapy was not permitted. Clinician reported acute toxicity was assessed at baseline, 2-weekly during CFMHRT and at 2, 4, 8 & 12 wks post-treatment.

However, there are no standard dosimetric guidelines, and normal tissue tolerances for extreme hypofractionation are not well defined. We analyzed dosimetric correlations with patient-reported urinary and bowel quality of life (QOL) on a prospective trial. Methods and Materials: Patients with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer from 18 institutions were enrolled on a phase 2 trial from 2007 to 2012 and treated using robotic SBRT to 38 Gy in 4 fractions on consecutive days. No androgen deprivation was used. Patients received simulation with Foley catheter for urethral delineation. The clinical target volume was prostate (low-risk patients) or prostate plus 1 cm of proximal seminal vesicles (intermediate-risk patients). Multiple dosimetric measures for urethra, bladder, and rectum were prospectively recorded. QOL using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite was assessed before and after treatment at protocol-specific time points. Linear regression was used to assess factors associated with QOL at 1 month and 2 years. Result(s): A total of 259 patients were enrolled. QOL data were available for 98%, 96%, and 84% at baseline, 1 month, and 2 years, respectively. Median age was 69 years. Prior transurethral resection of the prostate and clinical target volume size were associated with 2-year urinary incontinence. There was a trend toward worse 2-year obstruction/irritation in older patients on multivariable analysis. Bladder and urethral doses were not associated with either 1-month or 2-year urinary QOL. In contrast, rectum maximum dose was associated with both 1-month and 2-year bowel QOL. At 2 years, the proportion with moderate or big overall bowel problems (as defined by Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26) was significantly higher in patients with rectum maximum dose greater than versus less than the median 37.4 Gy (11% vs 2%, Fisher's exact test P =.008).

Our objective is to demonstrate that detectable changes in health-related quality of life measured by the bowel and urinary domains of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-50) were not substantially worse than baseline scores. Methods and Materials: NRG Oncology's RTOG 0938 is a nonblinded randomized phase 2 study of National Comprehensive Cancer Network low-risk prostate cancer in which each arm is compared with a historical control. Patients were randomized to 5 fractions (7.25 Gy in 2 weeks) or 12 fractions (4.3 Gy in 2.5 weeks). The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with a change in EPIC-50 bowel score at 1 year (baseline to 1 year) >5 points and in EPIC-50 urinary score >2 points tested with a 1-sample binomial test. Result(s): The study enrolled 127 patients to 5 fractions (121 analyzed) and 128 patients to 12 fractions (125 analyzed). Median follow-up for all patients at the time of analysis was 3.8 years. The 1-year frequency for >5 point change in bowel score were 29.8% (P <.001) and 28.4% (P <.001) for 5 and 12 fractions, respectively. The 1-year frequencies for >2 point change in urinary score were 45.7% (P <.001) and 42.2% (P <.001) for 5 and 12 fractions, respectively. For 5 fractions, 32.9% of patients had a drop in 1-year EPIC-50 sexual score of >=11 points (P =.34); for 12 fractions, 30.9% of patients had a drop in 1-year EPIC-50 sexual score of >= 11 points (P =.20). Disease-free survival at 2 years is 99.2% (95% confidence interval: 97.5-100) in the 5-fraction arm and 97.5% (95% confidence interval: 94.6-100) in the 12-fraction arm. There was no late grade 4 or 5 treatment-related urinary or bowel toxicity. Conclusion(s): This study confirms that, based on changes in bowel and urinary domains and toxicity (acute and late), the 5- and 12-fraction regimens are well tolerated.

METHODS: An IRB-approved institutional database was retrospectively reviewed for patients who underwent CK, Cryotherapy, or AHS. Quality of life (QoL) survey responses were collected every three months and the mean function scores were analyzed in yearly intervals over the 4 years post-treatment. RESULTS: 279 patients (767 survey sets) were included in the study. There was no difference among groups in urinary function scores. The CyberKnife group had significantly lower bowel habit scores in the early years following treatment (year 2 mean difference: -5.4, P < 0.01) but returned to AHS level scores by year 4. Cryotherapy patients exhibited initially lower, but not statistically significant, bowel function scores, which then improved and approached those of AHS. Both CyberKnife (year 1 mean difference: -26.7, P < 0.001) and Cryotherapy groups (-35.4, P < 0.001) had early lower sexual function scores relative to AHS, but then gradually improved and were not significantly different from AHS by the third year post-treatment. A history of hormonal therapy was associated with a lower sexual function scores relative to those patients who did not receive hormones in both CyberKnife (-18.45, P < 0.01) and Cryotherapy patients (-14.6, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: After initial lower bowel habits and sexual function scores, CyberKnife or Cryotherapy-treated patients had no significant difference in QoL relative to AHS patients. These results highlight the benefit of CyberKnife and Cryotherapy in the management of organ-confined prostate cancer.",exclusion,Not the right comparator,,,10.1038/s41391-017-0004-y,,,

Reported regimens differ in time, dose, and fractionation. We report the results of a multicentre, Canadian randomized phase II study to investigate the impact of overall treatment time on quality of life (QOL) and toxicity. Method(s): Men with cT1-2b, Gleason <=7, and PSA <= 20 ng/mL prostate cancer were randomly assigned to 40 Gy in 5 fractions delivered every other day (11 days) vs. once per week (29 days) using gantry-based SBRT. QOL was assessed using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) at baseline, weeks 2, 4, 6, 12, months 6 and 12, then annually. Toxicity was graded according to RTOG Criteria. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with a minimum clinically important change (MCIC) in bowel QOL at any time during the acute (<=12 week) period and was analyzed by Fisher's exact test with a two-sided p < 0.05 considered significant. MCIC was defined as a decrease in EPIC score of >0.5 standard deviation of the baseline value. Clinical-Trials.gov NCT01423474 . Result(s): 152 men from 3 centres were randomized with a median follow-up of 13.1 months. Baseline characteristics were similar in both arms except for the International Prostate Symptom Score with medians of 4 vs. 7 in the 11 and 29 day groups, respectively (p=0.02). There were significant differences between the 11 and 29 day groups in the proportion of patients with acute MCIC in bowel (90.0% vs. 69.6%, p<0.01) and urinary (95.7% vs. 74.6%, p<0.01) scores, respectively. No differences were found in acute sexual (p=0.38) or hormonal (p=0.48) QOL. Worst acute grade 1, 2, 3 toxicities were 64, 18, 0% vs. 41, 11, 0% (p<0.01) for GI and 38, 32, 1% vs. 30, 34, 3% (p=0.69) for GU in the 11 and 29 day groups, respectively. There were no late grade 3+ GI toxicities. Late grade 3 GU toxicity occurred in 1 vs. 0 patients in the 11 and 29 day arms (p=0.32). Conclusion(s): Prostate SBRT delivered over 29 days was associated with superior bowel and urinary QOL compared to 11 days in the first 3 months of treatment. There were few severe (grade 3+) toxicities in either group. Follow-up is continuing to compare long-term outcomes.",exclusion,Not the right comparator,,,,,,

At this moment, there are no specific treatment recommendations for patients with limited nodal recurrences and different locoregional treatment approaches are currently being used, mostly by means of metastasis-directed therapies (MDT): salvage lymph node dissection (sLND) or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Since the majority of patients treated with MDT relapse within 2 years in adjacent lymph node regions, with an estimated median time to progression of 12-18 months, combining MDT with whole pelvic radiotherapy (WPRT) may improve oncological outcomes in these patients. The aim of this prospective multicentre randomized controlled phase II trial is to assess the impact of the addition of WPRT to MDT and short-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on metastasis-free survival (MFS) in the setting of oligorecurrent pelvic nodal recurrence. METHODS & DESIGN: Patients diagnosed with PET-detected pelvic nodal oligorecurrence (≤5 nodes) following radical local treatment for PCa, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio between arm A: MDT and 6 months of ADT, or arm B: WPRT added to MDT and 6 months of ADT. Patients will be stratified by type of PET-tracer (choline, FACBC or PSMA) and by type of MDT (sLND or SBRT). The primary endpoint is MFS and the secondary endpoints include clinical and biochemical progression-free survival (PFS), prostate cancer specific survival, quality of life (QoL), toxicity and time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and to palliative ADT. Estimated study completion: December 31, 2023. DISCUSSION: This is the first prospective multicentre randomized phase II trial assessing the potential of combined WPRT and MDT as compared to MDT alone on MFS for patients with nodal oligorecurrent PCa.

Regional nodal recurrence is an emerging clinical situation since the introduction of new molecular imaging methods in the restaging of recurrent prostate cancer. More specifically, a subgroup of these patients is being diagnosed with a recurrence confined to the regional lymph nodes and limited in number (oligorecurrence) using choline or PSMA PET-CT. As there are no specific treatment recommendations for these type of patients, different treatment approaches are currently used, mostly focusing on local ablative treatments using radiotherapy or surgery. These treatments are coined metastasisdirected therapy (MDT). MDT in combination with or without temporary ADT could delay the subsequent risk of progression, and even cure limited regional nodal recurrences. Consequently, lifelong palliative ADT, with its toxicity and excess in non-cancer mortality might be postponed.random-journal.pdf,

We hypothesized that escalating the dose per fraction (fx) to the PF would have acceptable toxicity. Material(s) and Method(s): Tested dose levels (DLs) were 3.6 Gy x 15 fx (DL1); 4.7 Gy x 10 fx (DL2); and 7.1 Gy x 5 fx (DL3). Escalation followed a 6 + 6 rules-based design with 12 patients required at the maximum tolerated dose. Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as grade (G) >=3, gastrointestinal (GI) or genitourinary (GU) toxicity by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). Patients completed quality-of-life questionnaires. Result(s): Twenty-four patients with indications for adjuvant or salvage radiation therapy (RT) enrolled (6 at DL1 and 2; 12 at DL3). All patients had at least 6 months of follow-up (median follow-up, 14.1 months). Four patients received concurrent androgen deprivation therapy. No G >= 3 GI or GU toxicity was seen at any DL; 2 of 6 patients in the DL1 group, 3 of 6 in DL2, and 7 of 12 in DL3 experienced G2 GI toxicity during RT. Except in 1 patient, all acute G2 GI toxicity resolved by 10 weeks. Three of 12 patients reported an increase to G1 and G2 GU toxicity in the 2 weeks after RT in groups DL1 and DL2 and 1 of 12 patients in DL3. At week 2 after RT, decline in the 26-item Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite bowel domain met criteria for a minimally important difference in 71% of patients. At week 10, 1 of 6, 2 of 6, and 7 of 11 patients at DLs 1, 2, and 3, respectively, still met minimally important difference criteria. International Prostate Symptom Scores worsened 2 weeks after treatment but improved by 6 to 10 weeks. Conclusion(s): Dose escalation up to 7.1 Gy x 5 fx to the PF was completed without acute G >= 3 toxicity. There was transient G2 rectal toxicity at all DLs during and immediately after RT.

The primary endpoint was treatment completion rate without severe acute surgical complications. Secondary endpoints included patient-reported quality of life and physician-reported toxicities. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with nonmetastatic high-risk or locally advanced prostate cancer received 24 Gy in 3 fractions to the prostate and seminal vesicles over 5 days, completed 2 weeks before RP. Patients with pN1 disease were treated after multidisciplinary discussion and shared decision making. Patient-reported quality of life (International Prostate Symptom Score and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite 26-item version questionnaires) and physician-reported toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03) were assessed before SBRT, immediately before surgery, and at 3-month intervals for 1 year. RESULTS: Twelve patients were enrolled, and 11 completed treatment (1 patient had advanced disease on prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography after enrollment but before treatment). There were no significant surgical complications. After RP, 2 patients underwent additional radiation therapy to nodes with androgen suppression for pN1 disease. Median follow-up after completion of treatment was 20.1 months, with 9 of 11 patients having a follow-up period of >12 months. Two patients had biochemical recurrence (prostate-specific antigen ≥0.05) within the first 12 months, with an additional 2 patients found to have biochemical recurrence after the 12-month period. The highest Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events genitourinary grades were 0, 1, 2, and 3 (n = 1, 4, 4, and 2, respectively), and the highest gastrointestinal grades were 0, 1, and 2 (n = 9, 1, and 1, respectively). At 12 months, incontinence was the only grade ≥2 toxicity. One and 2 of 9 patients had grade 2 and 3 incontinence, respectively. On the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (26-item version), the mean/median changes in scores from baseline to 12 months were -32.8/-31.1 for urinary incontinence, -1.6/-6.2 for urinary irritative/obstructive, -2.1/0 for bowel, -34.4/-37.5 for sexual function, and -10.6/-2.5 for hormonal. The mean/median change in International Prostate Symptom Score from baseline to 12 months was 0.5/0.5. CONCLUSIONS: RP after neoadjuvant SBRT appears to be feasible and safe at the dose tested.

We conducted a clinical trial of stereotactic hypofractionated radiotherapy delivered in once-weekly fractions on patients with non-metastatic disease to test feasibility, acute toxicities, patient reported outcomes, and biochemical control in a cohort with predominantly high-risk disease. Purpose/Objective(s): Patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason 6-10, T1-4N0 (staged with multiparametric MRI and bone scans) and PSA <=60 ng/ml were eligible for enrolment into this Phase I/II trial. A planned sample of 30 patients were treated with volumetric intensity modulated arc radiation therapy to a dose of 35 Gy in 5 fractions delivered once-weekly with an overall treatment time of 29 days. Patients with high-risk disease also received elective nodal irradiation to a dose of 25 Gy in 5 fractions simultaneously. Androgen deprivation was offered to intermediate and high risk patients. Trial specific dose constraints were ensured. The primary outcome was acute toxicity with NCI CTC v4. Secondary outcome measures included biochemical control and late toxicity. Patient reported outcomes were measured with the IPSS score and EORTC QLQ-C30 and PR25 questionnaires. Clinically meaningful worsening of quality of life scores was defined as a 10 point reduction (out of 100) in any scale. Result(s): All 30 patients completed treatment per-protocol. The majority of patients had T3 (60%) and Gleason 7 (50%) tumors. The median PSA was 17 ng/ml. High risk disease was present in 20 patients (66.7%). There was low incidence of acute toxicities (Grade 2+ urinary toxicities in 1-3.3%, and grade 2+ rectal toxicities in none). The mean IPSS scores increased from baseline 8.6 to 14.6 at the end of treatment (P < 0.001) but reduced to 10.9 at 6 months (P = 0.05). Of the 21 parameters studied in the EORTC QLQ framework, only the urinary symptom score showed a clinically meaningful worsening from a mean of 20/100 at baseline to 34/100 at end of treatment (P < 0.001), but reduced to 24/100 at 6 months (P = 0.08). Other functional or symptomatic scales did not show any clinically meaningful worsening. There was 1 patient each with late grade 2 rectal bleeding and grade 2 urinary toxicity. With a median follow-up of 25 months, 1 patient developed a distant failure at 10 months, with a 2 year biochemical control rate of 96.7%. Conclusion(s): In a cohort of mainly high risk cancers in a developing country, stereotactic once-weekly radiation therapy was easy to implement, safe and well tolerated with a low incidence of acute toxicity. Preliminary biochemical control and late toxicity profiles are encouraging.

Stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) is an emerging treatment option that provides brachy-like BDE with good tolerance and significant cost/system resource/patient savings. Studies testing appropriate dose fractionation for SABR, incorporating pelvic elective lymph node irradiation (ENI), are limited. We report the short-term toxicity, quality of life (QOL), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response of a phase 2 study investigating SABR to prostate and ENI in high-risk prostate cancer patients. Materials/Methods: Thirty patients with cT3a-3b or Gleason >=8 or PSA >20 ng/mL were treated with 25 Gy in 5 weekly fractions to pelvis (ENI and seminal vesicles) and a simultaneous integrated boost of 40 Gy to prostate, over 29 days using gantry-based SABR. Clinical target volume (CTV) and planning target volume (PTV) margins were 3 mm for prostate and 6 mm for pelvis. CTVprostate V40>=99%, PTVprostate V33.25>=99%, CTVpelvis V25>=99%, PTVpelvis V23.75>=99%, and strict bladder and bowel constraints were enforced. Twelve to 18 months of androgen deprivation therapy was used. Primary endpoint was acute genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (CTCAE version 3.0), which was assessed at weeks 5 and 12 posttreatment. Secondary objectives include QOL data (EPIC); the proportion of patients experiencing a minimum clinically important change (MCIC) in bladder and bowel QOL at any time during the acute (>=12 week) period has been analyzed. SmallMCIC was defined as a decrease in EPIC score of >0.5 standard deviations (SD) (baseline score-worst EPIC score during acute follow-up) and large MCIC as >1.0 SD of the baseline value. Result(s): Median age of this cohort was 76 years (IQR 69-79 years) and median follow-up was 8 months (IQR 5.8-9.8 months). Median PSA at baseline was 10.6 ng/mL (IQR 7.6-13.1). Median PSA nadir during follow-up was 0.03 ng/mL (IQR 0.02- 0.09). There was no acute grade 3+ GU or GI toxicity. One (3%) patient had grade 2 GI toxicity, needing antidiarrheal medication at 3 months. Twelve (30%) patients were graded as having grade 2 GU toxicity at 3 months. Median EPIC score (higher score indicating better health) at baseline and at 3 months was 96.4 and 96.4 for bowel bother, 88.9 and 91.7 for urinary, 33.3 and 28.8 for sexual, and 83.0 and 70.5 for hormonal bother, respectively. Proportion of patients experiencing a small and a large MCIC was 45.0% and 40.0% for bowel bother, 61.9% and 33.3% for urinary, 45.0% and 45.0% for sexual, and 70.0% and 50.0% for hormonal bother summary scores, respectively. Conclusion(s): Gantry-based 5-fraction SABR for high-risk prostate cancer patients, incorporating ENI, delivered over 29 days was very well tolerated in the acute setting with no acute grade 3+ toxicities.

Usually, prostate SBRT has been delivered every other day in order to favor normal tissues recovery, minimizing side effects. Flattening Filter Free (FFF) delivery is a treatment modality able to reduce treatment beam-on time, decreasing patient positioning uncertainties. Aim of the present phase-II study is to evaluate the feasibility, side effects and biochemical control of FFF SBRT delivered in 5 consecutive days in a cohort of localized PC patients. Purpose/Objective(s): The study, approved by Ethical Committee, started on January 2014. Inclusion criteria were: age <= 80 years, World Health Organization performance status <= 2, histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma, low-intermediate risk according to D'Amico criteria, no distant metastases, no previous surgery other than TURP, no other malignant tumor in the previous 5 years, a pre-SBRT International Prostatic Symptoms Score (IPSS) ranged between 0 and 7. The SBRT-schedule was 35Gy for low risk and 37.5Gy for intermediate risk PC in 5 fractions, delivered in 5 consecutive days. SBRT was delivered with volumetric modulated radiation therapy (VMAT) and Image-guidance by Cone beam Computed tomography. Toxicity assessment was performed according to CTCAE v4.0 scale. Neoadjuvant/concomitant hormonal-therapy was prescribed according to risk classification. Result(s): At the time of the analysis, forty-two patients were recruited in the protocol and treated. Median age was 74 years (63-80 years), Median follow-up was 22 months (range: 15-34 months). According to risk-category, 31/42 patients were low-risk and 11/42 were intermediate risk. Median initial PSA was 6.1 ng/ml (range, 3.4-12.8 ng/ml). Median Gleason Score was 6 (6-7). IPSS pre-SBRT was registered for all patients, with a median value of 4 (range, 0-10). All patients completed the treatment as planned. Acute genitourinary toxicity was: G0 29/42 (70%), G1 7/42 (17%), G2 6/42 (13%). Acute gastrointestinal toxicity was: G0 36/42 (86%), G1 4/42 (9%), G2 2/42 (5%). No acute toxicities > G3 were recorded.

Feasibility was defined as the percent of patients successfully undergoing radical prostatectomy as scheduled without acute surgical complications. Physician reported toxicity was assessed by CTCAEv4 criteria and patient reported toxicity by EPIC and IPSS questionnaires. Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy was allowed. Patients who were N1 additionally underwent androgen deprivation concurrent with IMRT directed to the pelvic nodes subsequent to surgery. Result(s): Ten patients enrolled and all successfully completed SBRT and radical prostatectomy without any acute surgical complications. Median follow-up was 10 months. Three patients had Grade 2 incontinence and one had Grade 3 incontinence and ultimately underwent successful placement of an artificial sphincter with return of urinary continence. There were no Grade 2 or higher GI toxicities. One patient was on androgen deprivation prior to the SBRT that was continued through radical prostatectomy. Pre-treatment biopsies and irradiated, resected malignant prostates allow for correlative analyses that investigate acute changes to tumor tissue and infiltrating immune cell subsets after SBRT.

At the time of analysis late GU and GI toxicities were as follows: GU-G0 43/52 (83%), GU-G1 7/52 (13%), GU-G2 2/52 (4%); GI-G0 48/52 (92%), GI-G1 2/52 (4%), GI-G2 2/52 (4%). No late toxicities ≥G3 were recorded. bNED was 98%. One patient with intermediate PC had distant progression. CONCLUSIONS: Accelerated SBRT for low-intermediate PC is feasible and well tolerated with comparable oncological outcome as described for other series with the same RT technique but treatment delivery on every other day. Longer follow-up is needed to the assess late toxicity profile and long-term clinical outcome.",exclusion,Not the right comparator,Compares different dosing frequencies,,10.1007/s00066-018-1338-7,,,

Usually, prostate SBRT has been delivered every other day in order to favour normal tissues recovery, minimizing side effects. Flattening Filter Free (FFF) delivery is a treatment modality able to reduce treatment beam-on time, decreasing patient positioning uncertainties. Aim of the present phase-II study is to evaluate the feasibility, side effects and biochemical control of FFF SBRT delivered in 5 consecutive days in a cohort of localized PC patients. Material and Methods The study, approved by Ethical Committee, started on January 2014. Inclusion criteria were: age <= 80 years, World Health Organization performance status <= 2, histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma, lowintermediate risk according to D'Amico criteria, no distant metastases, no previous surgery other than TURP, no other malignant tumor in the previous 5 years, a pre-SBRT International Prostatic Symptoms Score (IPSS) ranged between 0 and 7. The SBRT-schedule was 35Gy for low risk and 37.5Gy for intermediate risk PC in 5 fractions, delivered in 5 consecutive days. SBRT was delivered with volumetric modulated radiation therapy (VMAT). Toxicity assessment was performed according to CTCAE v4.0 scale. Neoadjuvant/concomitant hormonal-therapy was prescribed according to risk classification. Results At the time of the analysis, forty-two patients were recruited in the protocol and treated. Median age was 74 years (63-80), Median follow-up was 19 months (range: 12- 31). According to risk-category, 31/42 patients were lowrisk and 11/42 were intermediate risk. Median initial PSA was 6.1 ng/ml (range, 3.4-12.8 ng/ml). Median Gleason score was 6 (6-7). IPSS pre-SBRT was registered for all patients, with a median value of 4 (range, 0 - 10). All patients completed the treatment as planned. Acute genitourinary toxicity was: G0 29/42 (70%), G1 7/42 (17%), G2 6/42 (13%). Acute gastrointestinal toxicity was: G0 36/42 (86%), G1 4/42 (9%), G2 2/42 (5%). No acute toxicities > G3 were recorded. At the time of the analysis late GU and GI toxicities were: GU-G0 33/42 (78%), GU-G1 7/42 (17%), GU-G2 1/42 (2%), GU-G3 1/42 (2%); GI-G0 39/42 (93%), GI-G1 3/42 (7%) and the median value of IPSS was 4.5 (range, 0 - 20). To date, biochemical control was 100%. Conclusion The present FFF SBRT phase-II study for low-intermediate PC delivered in 5 consecutive days showed to be feasible and well tolerated as well as other series with the same technique and fractionation delivered every other day (Alongi et al Radiation Oncology 2013).

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) represents an effective treatment but no consensus exists regarding dose and fractionation. Aim of this trial was to evaluate safety and efficacy of high-dose SBRT. We included patients with 1 to 3 lymph node metastases. Primary end-point was safety, while secondary end-points were in-field local control (LC), out-field lymph nodal progression free survival (LPFS), distant metastasis free survival (DMFS), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). 64 lesions in 52 patients were treated from 2015 to 2019. Most common primary tumor was genitourinary cancer (75%), in particular prostate cancer (65.4%). With a median follow-up of 24.4 months (range 3-49), treatment was very well tolerated, with only 4 (7.7%) patients reporting acute side effects, all classified as grade 1, in the form of pain, fatigue, nocturia and dysuria. No toxicity ≥ grade 2 were reported. Rates of LC at 1, 2 and 3 years were 97.9%, 82.1% and 82.1%. Male sex (HR 0.12, p value 0.014) was associated with improved LC. LPFS at 1, 2 and 3 years were 69.6%, 49.6% and 46.1%, respectively, and DMFS was 81.74%, 67.5% and 58.5%, respectively. Presence of lesions in other organs was correlated with inferior DMFS (HR 3.82, p = 0.042). PFS at 1, 2 and 3 years were 67.4%, 42.4% and 31.86%, respectively. OS at 1, 2 and 3 years were 97.3%, 94.2%, 84%, respectively and significantly correlated with in-field recurrence (HR 8.72, p = 0.000).

The hypothesis is that SBRT can control the macroscopic disease and HT the microscopic one, as well as to test in hormone-sensitive (HS) patients the pause of the HT after biochemical control is achieved and that Castration Resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is not radioresistant prostate cancer, and SBRT can delay new systemic treatments. Materials/Methods: Prostate cancer patients (HS or CRPC) in an oligorecurrent stage defined as less than 5 bone or lymph node metastases (including spinal bones) by Choline PET-CT or/and WB-DWI-MRI after primary treatment, were assigned to receive SBRT: Vertebral metastases: 1x16-18Gy or 3x8-9Gy; lymph node metastases: 3x10-11 Gy or 6x7,5Gy; non-spinal bone metastases: 1x16Gy or 3x10Gy. Inclusion criteria included: time from primary treatment to biochemical recurrence > 1 year and PSA doubling time> 2 months. A minimum of 24 months of LhRh analogues from the time of the enrollment was required. In HS patients, its withdrawal can be considered after two years of treatment if biochemical control is achieved. Local control rates, biochemical control rates and progression free survival were assessed. Toxicity was prospectively evaluated according to CTCAE.4 criteria. Previous or concomitant treatment with chemotherapy, abiraterone or enzalutamide was not allowed. Result(s): From 07/2014 to 12/2018, 81 patients from 14 Spanish centers were recruited with a total of 117 oligometastases treated, 67 in lymph nodes, 43 in non-spinal bones and 7 in spinal bones. Fourteen patients had CRPC. With a median follow-up after SBRT of 22 months, (range 4,2-48,9 months) local control was 100% and biochemical control was 97,5%. Median Progression free survival was 36,4 months (IC95%= 32,3 - 40,5). 14 patients (17,3%) presented distant disease progression, 4 of them were CRPC. Seven of those 14 patients who relapsed were treated again with SBRT at that time. Specifically, in patients with CRPC, with a median follow-up after SBRT of 24,1 months (range 4,2 -48,9), the median PFS was 26,3 months, (range 17,3-35,3 months). 10 of the 14 CRPC patients (71%) are free from disease progression at last follow-up without the need to start second generation hormonal treatment or chemotherapy. Tolerance and toxicity profiles were excellent, none of the patients developed toxicity >=G3 or symptoms related to local progression of the disease.

Few data exist on radiotherapy in the context of isolated or limited lymph node metastases. We analyzed clinical results of oligometastatic patients treated with high dose SBRT for lymph node metastases in abdomen and pelvis. Material(s) and Method(s): This is a prospective, phase 2 trial. Primary end-point was the assessment of acute and late toxicity; secondary endpoints were local control (LC), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) The schedule of SBRT was 48 Gy delivered in 4 fractions of 12 Gy each. Inclusion criteria were: Histologically-proven carcinoma of gastro-intestinal, genito-urinary of gynecological primary site, WHO performance status <= 2, maximum 3 lymph node sites of disease, maximum diameter <= 5 cm, abdomen-pelvic site. Physical examinations and toxicity assessments were performed during and after SBRT according to CTCAE v4.0. Tumour response was evaluated on CT-MRI-PET scans using the RECIST modified criteria. Result(s): From 2015 to 2018, 41 patients with 52 lymph nodes were enrolled. Median age was 69.2 years and 87.8% of patients were male. Most common primary tumour was located in genito-urinary tract (70.7%), and in particular prostate adenocarcinoma (58.%%), followed by gastro-intestinal (26.8%) and gynecological (2.5%) disease. One single lymph node was treated 32 patients, while 2 and 3 lymph node in 7 and 2 patients, respectively. Systemic therapy was administered before SBRT in 43.9% of patients and during SBRT in 14.6%. Median clinical target volume diameter was 15 mm (6 - 49). With a median follow-up of 16.7 months, only 3 patients reported grade 1 acute toxicity, in the form of pain, dysuria and fatigue. In the late setting, chronic pain was observed in 1 patient. In-field progression was observed in 5 (12.2%) patients with a 1- and 2- years rate of 96.4% and 77.1%. Systemic therapy during SBRT was associated with worse LC (HR 8.6, 95%CI 1.41 - 52.7, p=0.020). Out-field lymphnodal progression was observed in 17 (41.4%) of cases and distant progressions in 8 (19.5%) cases. Median PFS was 12.8 months. At time of analysis all patients were alive except one with 1- and 2-years OS of 100% and 94.7%.

Material(s) and Method(s): This study was based on a prospective analysis of 42 patients enrolled between May 2013 and November 2014 (see Table I; Abstract 26). Patients underwent CT-based virtual simulation with 3-mm thick slices obtained at 3 mm intervals in the supine position. For planning, the GTV included the prostate with the 1/3 proximal seminal vesicles without margin; a margin of 5 mm in all directions around the GTV was applied to define the PTV. All patients were treated with IG-SBRT at a Clinac iX linear accelerator (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA), utilizing VMAT technique with a 2 full arcs arrangement and photons with beam energy of 6 MV, according to pre-established treatment dose specifications and DHV constraints: in particular, for PTV plans were optimised aiming to obtain V95%>95% D98%>94%, V2%<108%; concerning the rectum, the requirements were: mean<18Gy, V20<35%, V32 <10%, V37<5%, D1%<40Gy, while for the bladder, the goal was to keep mean dose <14 Gy and V21 <40%, V33 <30%, V38 <13%, D1%<40Gy; for the penile bulb: mean <10 Gy. All dose distributions were computed with the Anisotropic Analytical Algorithm (AAA) implemented in the Eclipse planning system with a calculation grid resolution of 2.0 mm. Routine institutional image-based patient position verification protocols foresaw daily on-line matching by CBCT. The acute and late toxicities were recorded using the RTOG/EORTC scale. Additional data were collected by means of I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) e IIEF-5 (International Index of Erectile Function) questionnaires. Biochemical failure was determined using the Phoenix definition. Result(s): The median follow-up duration was 27 months (range: 24 to 36 months). The median age was 74 years (range: 57-80 years). Most dosimetric parameters for the OARs are well within the protocol constraints, with the notable exception of maximal doses to rectum and bladder for which the constraints are exceeded in about 20% of cases, but we did not observe any statistical correlation. Acute GU toxicity of grade 2 (increase in urinary frequency) was observed in 7% of the patients. The incidence rates of late GI and GU toxicity of any grade were 14.2% and 35.7%, respectively. The late GU toxicity of grade >=2 was 4.7%. No GE late toxicity >=2 was noted. Previous abdominal surgery appeared to be statistically significant (p=0.004; Fisher's test) for the increase of probability of late GE toxicity. The 3-year local recurrencefree survival rate was 98%, only one patient had clinical abdominal lymph node failure. Among the dosimetric data, only V21 revealed to be statistically significant for the late GU (p=0.035; Wilcoxon Mann Whitney Test). Conclusion(s): Our experience with VMAT-based SBRT in low-and intermediate-risk prostate cancer demonstrates favorable efficacy in tumor control and toxicity profile with no decrease in QOL as determined by I-PSS, IIEF. The general good quality of the clinical outcome and the results concerning GI and GU toxicities seem to confirm the robustness of the dosimetric paradigm adopted.

random-journal.pdf,ProP179,"C., Greco",2019,English,1 population;pro.m,Phenotype-Oriented Ablation of Oligometastatic Cancer with Single Dose Radiation Therapy,"Purpose: The current oligometastatic (OM) model postulates that the disease evolves dynamically with sequential emergence of OM (SOM) lesions requiring successive rounds of SOM ablation to afford tumor cure. The present phase 2 study explores the ablative efficacy of 24 Gy single-dose radiation therapy (SDRT), its feasibility in diverse OM settings, and the impact of radioablation on polymetastatic (PM) dissemination. Methods and Materials: One hundred seventy-five consecutive patients with 566 OM or SOM lesions underwent periodic positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging to stage the disease before treatment, determine tumor response, and monitor timing of PM conversion after SDRT. When 24 Gy SDRT was restricted by dose or volume constraints of serial normal organs, radioablation was diverted to a nontoxic 3x9 Gy SBRT schedule. Result(s): SOM/SOMA occurred in 42% of the patients, and 24 Gy SDRT was feasible in 76% of the lesions. Despite 92% actuarial 5-year OM ablation by 24 Gy SDRT, respective PM-free survival (PMFS) was 26%, indicating PM conversion dominates over effective OM radioablation in many patients. Multivariate analysis of OM metrics derived from staging PET/CT scanning before first treatment predicted PMFS outcome after SDRT. Bivariate analysis of dichotomized high versus low baseline metric combinations of CT-derived tumor load (cutoff at 14.8 cm3) and PET-derived metabolic SUVmax (cutoff at 6.5) yielded a 3-tiered PMFS categorization of 89%, 58% and 17% actuarial 5-year PMFS in categories 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P < .001), defining OM disease as a syndrome of diverse clinical and prognostic phenotypes. Conclusion(s): Long-term risk of PM dissemination, predicted by preablation PET/CT staging, provides guidelines for phenotype-oriented OM therapy. In categories 1 and 2, radioablation should be a primary therapeutic element when pursuing tumor cure, whereas in the PM-prone category 3, radioablation should be a component of multimodal trials addressing primarily the risk of PM dissemination. PET/CT baseline staging also provides a platform for discovery of pharmacologically accessible PM drivers as targets for new phenotype-oriented treatment protocols.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",exclusion,Other study design (phase I/II),,PM139,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.02.033,,,
random-journal.pdf,ProP180,"R., Olson",2019,English,pro.m,Population-based Phase II Trial of Stereotactic Radiotherapy for up to 5 Oligometastases: SABR-5,"Purpose or Objective: Oligometastases refer to a state of disease where cancer has spread beyond the primary site, but is not yet widely metastatic, often defined as 1-3 or 1-5 metastases in number. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is an emerging radiotherapy technique to treat oligometastases that require further prospective population-based toxicity estimates. Material(s) and Method(s): This is a non-randomized phase II trial in a setting where SABR for oligometastases is not available off clinical trial. All participants receive SABR treatment to all sites of newly diagnosed or progressing oligometastatic disease. We have accrued 150 of a planned 200 patients to assess toxicity associated with this experimental treatment. The study was powered to give a 95% confidence on the risk of late grade 4 toxicity, anticipating a < 5% rate of grade 4 toxicity. Result(s): We have accrued 150 patients within 18 months, and anticipate completion of study accrual by December 2018. The majority (65%) had a solitary metastasis, followed by 26%, 7%, and only 2% who had 2,3, or 4-5 metastases, respectively. Within the 150 patients, 220 metastases were treated, with the most common locations being lung (35%), non-spine bone (24%), spine (21%), lymph nodes (9%), and liver (7%). The majority of primary tumour sites were prostate (27%), colorectal (21%), breast (11%), renal cell carcinoma (11%), and head and neck cancer (9%). To date, no SABR related deaths have occurred, but there has been 1 grade 4 serious adverse event related to SABR reported (biliary duct stenosis resulting in jaundice). Updated adverse event rates will be presented. Conclusion(s): SABR treatment of oligometastases is occurring off-trial at a high rate, without sufficient evidence of its efficacy or toxicity.

In contrast to surgical prostatectomy, implementation of rapidly expanding SAbR paradigm in combination with recent advances in radiotherapy techniques for target delineation, using MR/CT, and precise patient setup brings a potential for sparing neurovascular-elements (NEs) and keeping erectile function after radiotherapy. At our institution, we initiated a multi-center randomized phase II trial (POTEN-C) to evaluate the impact of NE-sparing SAbR on a patient-reported sexual QOL endpoint. Predicting a best dose painting that spare unilateral NEs with SAbR while maintaining target coverage and normal tissue constraints for adjacent OARs is essential. In this study we propose to use a deep learning technique to predict the best achievable dose metrics for the OARs and the target. Method(s): Our retrospective study uses 12 patients with low to intermediate risk without high-risk MR lesions within 5 mm. Rectal hydrogel-spacer is implanted. A clinically acceptable plan for each patient is generated to satisfy constrains at our institution. We collected a series of geometrical parameters combined with dose metrics in these plans. We used 10/ 12 of these data sets to train a 3-layer fully connected convolutional-neuralnetwork (CNN). We examined the accuracy of our trained network with the remaining 2 data sets to predict the dose metrics and reconstruct 3D-dose painting. Result(s): Plans with unilaterally spared NEs are successfully generated to meet constraints. Our CNN method is able to predict maximum dose to rectum, bladder wall, and NE with differences of <5%,<2%,<5%, respectively. The CNN can also predict volume and circumference based dosimetric data. On average, our CNN method predicts all dose metrics with an accuracy of <7%. Conclusion(s): The CNN-based dose predication method is effective to establish a guideline for treatment planning of the complex NE-sparing SAbR of prostate cancer.",exclusion,Other study design (phase I/II),,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mp.12938,,,

The purpose of this study was to identify patient related and dosimetric predictors of acute urinary flare in a prospective cohort of patients undergoing stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for localized prostate cancer. Materials/Methods: One hundred three men were treated definitively for localized prostate cancer using robotic SBRT on a prospective institutional protocol. The planning target volume (PTV) consisted of the prostate and proximal seminal vesicles as defined on non-contrast CT and fused T2 MRI with a 3 mm margin at the prostate-bladder interface. Inverse plans were generated with a prescription dose (PD) of 35 to 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions to the PTV using 6 MV photons. Patients who were not already using alpha-receptor antagonists were prophylactically treated with tamsulosin. Patient surveys including the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) were conducted before and one week following the completion of SBRT. Cumulative and differential dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were created for the bladder, bladder wall, bladder neck, and prostatic urethra. Acute urinary flare was defined as an increase in IPSS of 5 points or more with an absolute score of at least 15 points. Result(s): Twenty-one point four percent of patients experienced acute urinary flare one week following completion of prostate SBRT. Dosevolume cut-off analysis was performed in order to identify statistically significant predictors of acute urinary flare. Univariate regression analysis of patient-related and dosimetric parameters demonstrated that prostatic volume and bladder wall D15.5% were significant predictors of acute urinary flare. Multivariate regression analysis confirmed both prostatic volume and bladder wall D15.5% as significant independent predictors of urinary flare, with a median split prostate volume of 36 cm3 resulting in an 11.8% versus 37.2% incidence of acute flare and a median split dose to the hottest 15.5% of bladder wall of 32.6 Gy resulting in a 9.8% versus 34.6% incidence of acute flare. No dosimetric parameters of the bladder, bladder neck, or prostatic urethra were significantly associated with increased toxicity. Conclusion(s): Dose-volume histogram analysis of acute urinary toxicity identified that the bladder wall D15.5%, in addition to prostate volume, is a significant predictor of acute urinary flare in patients treated with SBRT for prostate cancer. The consequential effects of acute urinary flare in this prospective cohort of patients treated with prostate SBRT in terms of late urinary toxicity warrants further investigation.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,,,,

Treatment of patients with intermediate risk disease remains cautionary due to the heterogeneity within this population with respect to risk for occult extraprostatic disease. Here we report an analysis of PSA outcomes following SBRT for intermediate risk prostate cancer and identify disease specific risk factors for biochemical failure. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients treated with SBRT at Georgetown University Hospital for intermediate risk prostate adenocarcinoma, with or without the use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), were included in this retrospective analysis. Treatment was delivered using CyberKnife SBRT with doses of 35 Gy or 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions. PSA failure was defined as a rise > 2 ng/ml above nadir (ASTRO Phoenix definition) and analyzed using the Kaplan Meier method. A Cox proportional hazards model was generated using disease related covariates including T stage, primary gleason pattern, pretreatment PSA, number of positive cores, percent positive cores, maximum single core involvement in order to identify potential predictors of PSA relapse after SBRT. A logrank test was also used to compare patients classified as having favorable vs. unfavorable intermediate risk disease by previously reported criteria of primary gleason pattern 4>=, 50% cores involved, or >=2 intermediate risk factors. Result(s): Three hund;red and fifty three patients at a median age of 70 years (range, 46 to 90) received SBRT. ADT was initiated prior to SBRT in 16% of patients and the median pre treatment PSA was 7.2 ng/ml (range, 0.8 to 19.9). The overall 3-year biochemical relapse free survival (bRFS) was 93.9%. Cox regression identified primary gleason pattern as the only significant predictor of PSA relapse with a HR of 5.84 (1.92 to 17.8, 95% CI) for primary gleason pattern 4 vs. 3. There was no significant difference in bRFS between patients classified as having favorable vs. unfavorable intermediate risk disease, HR 0.39 (0.11 to 1.41, 95% CI). There were no significant benefits observed with respect to ADT in any subgroup. Conclusion(s): Early PSA responses after SBRT for intermediate risk prostate adenocarcinoma compare favorably to those reported using other radiation therapy modalities. Primary gleason pattern 4 is predictive of less favorable bRFS, however early rates of PSA control are excellent compared to historical controls. The role of ADT in these patients is still unclear. The current evidence supports SBRT as a standard therapeutic option in intermediate risk disease.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,,,,

Most recurrences in this scenario are characterized by continuous PSA rises and failure of standard imaging (bone scan [BS] and computed tomography [CT]) to detect recurrence sites. We conducted a phase II trial for men with rising PSA after MLT using 18F-DCFPyL PET-MR followed by targeted ablation of PET positive foci. We report the results of our pre-defined analysis. Method(s): Patients with rising PSA (0.43.0 ng/mL) after MLT, negative BS/CT and no prior salvage ADT were eligible. All patients underwent 18F-DCFPyL PET-MR followed by immediate PET-CT acquisition. Those with limited disease, where possible, underwent stereotactic ablative RT (SABR) or surgery. No ADT was used. The primary endpoint was biochemical response rate (complete [undetectable PSA] or partial [PSA decline >50% compared to baseline]). A Simon's two stage study design was employed. Stage 1 included 12 response evaluable patients, requiring 1 or more responses in the absence of grade 3+ toxicities to proceed to stage 2 (additional 25 response evaluable patients). Result(s): After a median of 58 months (range 29-120) post MLT, 20 patients underwent PET-MR/CT to have 12 response evaluable patients. Median PSA at enrollment was 1.3 ng/mL (range 0.4-2.8). Three patients had negative PET-MR/CT, while 17 had positive scans, of which 12 (60%) were amenable to response evaluable ablation. The median number of detected lesions in those treated was 2 (range 1-5). Ten patients underwent SABR (27-30 Gy/3 fractions) and 2 had surgery. One patient (8%) had complete and 4 (33%) had partial PSA responses at a median of 3.3 months (range 2.8-6.0) after ablation, while the remaining 7 (59%) did not have biochemical response. No grade 3+ toxicities were observed. Conclusion(s): 18F-DCFPyL PET/MR has high detection rates in men with rising PSA after MLT. We observed favorable early results with SABR or surgery (41% RR).

random-journal.pdf,ProP186,"H., Nagar",2019,English,pro.p:#2,Preoperative radiotherapy for high-risk prostate cancer (PORT-PC) trial,"Background: Prostatectomy has become the most common treatment for high-risk prostate cancer. After prostatectomy, risk features for local recurrence include extra-capsular extension and/or seminal vesicle invasion (pT3 disease) and positive surgical margins. Post-operative radiotherapy is recommended for patients with pT3 disease, positive margins and/or Group Grade 4-5 and has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrence. In planning adjuvant radiotherapy, the clinical target volume is the prostate bed which is difficult to delineate once the prostate has been surgically removed and can be overestimated by following the location of surgical clips. As such, controversy exists as to the optimal target volume. Guidelines suggest including a significant portion of the posterior and inferior aspects of the bladder, and anterior aspect of the rectum exposing a significant amount of normal tissue to high dose radiation. Pre-operative radiotherapy potentially offers the following advantages: 1) reduced radiation dose to normal tissues; 2) ability to utilize stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with real-time MRI guidance 3) patient convenience with less fractions and 4) radiobiologic advantage of high dose per fraction treatment delivery. Method(s): This is a modified dose escalation trial for patients with high-risk prostate cancer defined as cT3 on MRI or Group Grade 4-5 disease. Patients will sequentially undergo 1) placement of a rectal SpaceOAR, 2) SBRT on the ViewRay MRIdian linear accelerator and 3) prostatectomy. As a modified dose escalation study, patients will be accrued starting at 5 Gy x 5 (up to 8 Gy x 5) with 3 patients per cohort with Grade 4 or 5 gastrointestinal (GI) and/or genitourinary (GU) adverse event related to preoperative radiotherapy as an unacceptable dose limiting toxicity.The primary endpoint is that a patient can undergo a radical prostatectomy after SBRT without a postoperative GI or GU grade 4 or 5 toxicity within 30 days related to preoperative radiotherapy. Secondary objectives include assessment of acute toxicity and quality of life scores. Exploratory analyses include analysis of tumor and normal biopsied and resected tissue and serum markers and interpretation of pre- and post-SBRT MRIs.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,,,,

Since PCa cells are known to be sensitive to high fraction doses, hypofractionated whole gland stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in conjunction with a simultaneous ablative microboost to the macroscopic tumour(s) within the prostate could be a way to reduce the risk of local failure. We investigated the safety of this treatment strategy. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients with intermediate or high risk PCa were enrolled in a prospective phase II trial, called hypo-FLAME. All patients were treated with extreme hypofractionated doses of 35 Gy in 5 weekly fractions to the whole prostate gland with an integrated boost up to 50 Gy to the multiparametric (mp) MRI-defined tumour(s). Treatment-related toxicity was measured using the CTCAE v4.0. The primary endpoint of the trial was treatment-related acute toxicity. Result(s): Between April 2016 and December 2018, 100 men were treated in 4 academic centres. All patients were followed up for a minimum of 6 months. The median mean dose delivered to the visible tumour nodule(s) on mpMRI was 44.7 Gy in this trial. No grade >=3 acute genitourinary (GU) or gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was observed. Furthermore, 90 days after start of treatment, the cumulative acute grade 2 GU and GI toxicity rates were 34.0% and 5.0%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Simultaneous focal boosting to the macroscopic tumour(s) in addition to whole gland prostate SBRT is associated with acceptable acute GU and GI toxicity.Copyright © 2020",exclusion,Other study design (phase I/II),,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2020.03.015,,,

Importantly, biomarkers to determine patients who benefit most from complete ablation are unknown. We hypothesize that stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR) will improve oncologic outcomes in men with OMPC. Materials/Methods: In this phase II randomized trial, men with recurrent hormone-sensitive OMPC (1-3 radiation fields) were stratified by primary management (radiotherapy vs surgery), PSA doubling time, and prior androgen deprivation therapy and randomized 2:1 to SABR or observation (OBS). The primary endpoint was progression at 6 months by PSA (>= 25% increase and >= nadir + 2 ng/mL), conventional imaging (RECIST 1.1 criteria or new lesion on bone scan), or symptomatic decline. Tissue, liquid and imaging correlative studies were obtained and analyzed as biomarkers. Result(s): From 5/2016-3/2018, 54 patients were randomized. Progression at 6 months was observed in 19% of patients in the SABR arm and 61% of patients in the OBS arm (ITT, p=0.005). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached for men treated with SABR and 5.8 months for men who underwent OBS (HR 0.30, p = 0.0023). Of 35 patients in the SABR arm who received PSMA-based PET/CT imaging at baseline and 6 months, those with total consolidation of radiotracer-avid disease were less likely to develop new lesions at 6 months (16% vs 63%, p = 0.006) and had significantly longer median PFS (unreached vs 11.8 months, p = 0.003) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (29 vs 6.0 months, p = 0.0008). No grade III or higher toxicity was observed. Deep sequencing of T-cell receptor DNA identified significantly more clonotypic expansions (p = 0.03) between baseline and day 90 with SABR than with observation, greater peripheral baseline clonality was correlated with progression at 180 days in the SABR arm only, and clusters of similar expanded T-cell receptors were identified in 3 patients after SABR. Analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is in progress. Conclusion(s): SABR for OMPC affords significant benefits in freedom from progression at 6 months and PFS. In fact, the PFS for patients treated with SABR still has not been reached and is well over one year. Total consolidation of disease identified by PSMA-PET with SABR provides a substantial advantage in DMFS (4.8 times greater) when compared to subtotal consolidation. SABR also induces a systemic adaptive immune response and baseline clonality was associated with predictive response to SABR. These results underline the importance of prospective randomized investigation of the oligometastatic state with concurrent collection of imaging and biological correlates. Author Disclosure: R.

While previous studies have assessed acute rectal morbidity at 1 month after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), little data exist on the prevalence and severity of rectal morbidity within the first week following treatment. This study reports the acute bowel morbidity 1 week following prostate SBRT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between May 2013 and August 2014, 103 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer were treated with 35-36.25 Gy in five fractions using robotic SBRT delivered on a prospective clinical trial. Bowel toxicity was graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAEv.4). Bowel QOL was assessed using the EPIC-26 questionnaire bowel domain at baseline, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months. Time-dependent changes in bowel symptoms were statistically compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Clinically significant change was assessed by the minimally important difference (MID) in EPIC score. This was defined as a change of 1/2 standard deviation (SD) from the baseline score. RESULTS: One-hundred and three patients with a minimum of 3 months of follow-up were analyzed. The cumulative incidence of acute grade 2 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was 23%. There were no acute ≥ grade 3 bowel toxicities. EPIC bowel summary scores maximally declined at 1 week after SBRT (-13.9, p < 0.0001) before returning to baseline at 3 months after SBRT (+0.03, p = 0.94). Prior to treatment, 4.9% of men reported that their bowel bother was a moderate to big problem. This increased to 28.4% (p < 0.0001) 1 week after SBRT and returned to baseline at 3 months after SBRT (0.0%, p = 0.66). Only the bowel summary and bowel bother score declines at 1 week met the MID threshold for clinically significant change. CONCLUSION: The rate and severity of acute proctitis following prostate SBRT peaked at 1 week after treatment and returned to baseline by 3 months. Toxicity assessment at 1 week can therefore minimize recall bias and should aid in the design of future clinical trials focused on accurately capturing and minimizing acute morbidity following SBRT.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2016.00167,,,

The goal of this study is to use a propensity score matched (PSM) analysis with the National Cancer Database (NCDB) for the comparison of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for organ confined prostate cancer. Method(s): Men with localized prostate cancer treated with radiation dose >=72 Gy for IMRT and >=35 Gy for SBRT to the prostate only were abstracted from the NCDB. Men treated with previous surgery, brachytherapy, or proton therapy were excluded. Matching was performed to eliminate confounding variables via PSM. Simple 1-1 nearest neighbor matching resulted in a matched sample of 5,430 (2,715 in each group). Subset analyses of men with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) > 10, GS = 7, and GS > 7 yielded matched samples of 1,020, 2,194, and 247, respectively. Result(s): No difference in survival was noted between IMRT and SBRT at 8 years (p = 0.65). Subset analyses of higher risk men with PSA > 10 or GS = 7 histology or GS > 7 histology revealed no difference in survival between IMRT and SBRT (p = 0.58, p = 0.68, and p = 0.62, respectively). Variables significant for survival for the matched group included: age (p < 0.0001), primary payor (p = 0.0001), Charlson/Deyo Score (p = 0.0002), PSA (p = 0.0013), Gleason score (p < 0.0001), and use of hormone therapy (p = 0.02). Conclusion(s): Utilizing the NCDB, there is no difference in survival at 8 years comparing IMRT to SBRT in the treatment of localized prostate cancer. Subset analysis confirmed no difference in survival even for intermediate- and high-risk patients based on Gleason Score and PSA.Copyright © 2017 Ricco, Hanlon and Lanciano.",inclusion,,,,10.3389/fonc.2017.00185,inclusion,,

In this report, we compare the efficacy and toxicity outcomes of prostate cancer patients treated with SBRT to those who received intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). METHODS: Two hundred sixty-three patients with localized prostate adenocarcinoma were included, ranging from clinically very low- to high-risk groups. We retrospectively compare consecutive patients treated with SBRT with consecutive patients treated with conventionally fractionated IMRT. For most patients, SBRT was delivered to a total dose of 36.25 Gy in five fractions and IMRT to 75.6 Gy in 42 fractions. To minimize selection bias, we perform propensity score analyses. RESULTS: The treatment groups became similar after propensity matching with absolute standard bias reduced to ≤0.19. For the first analysis, 5-year actuarial survival was 90.8 and 88.1 % in SBRT and IMRT groups, respectively (p = 0.7260), while FFBF was 88.7 and 95.5 %, respectively (p = 0.1720).

Toxicity did not exceed grade 3 in any of the studied patients. The highest recorded genitourinary toxicity at the time of latest follow-up was grade 2.

Recent analysis has shown SBRT to be over $7,000 cheaper than the standard of care, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and on average is 6 to 7 weeks shorter in duration. We compare SBRT to IMRT in terms of non-inferiority. Method(s): Two hundred and sixtythree patients were analyzed. Patients had localized prostate adenocarcinoma, ranging from very lowto high-risk disease. We retrospectively compare consecutive patients treated with SBRT with consecutive patients treated with conventionally fractionated IMRT at a separate site within the same hospital-based department. Most common dose scheme for SBRT is 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions, and IMRT 75.6 Gy in 42 fractions. To minimize selection bias, we perform two separate propensity score analyses. We use 1:1 propensity score matching with caliper, differing by the inclusion of risk group, and several other patient and tumor factors. Result(s): As a result of matching, treatment groups became similar, absolute standard bias reduced to <= 0.19 for both matching analyses. For the first analysis (not accounting for risk group), five-year Kaplan Meier (KM) survival was 90.8% and 88.1% in the SBRT and IMRT treatment groups, respectively (p = 0.7260); while freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) was 88.7% and 95.5%, respectively (p = 0.1720). For the second analysis (which accounts for risk group), five-year KM survival was 96.7% and 87.1% in the SBRT and IMRT treatment groups, respectively (p = 0.3025); while FFBF was 89.7% and 90.3%, respectively (p = 0.6446). Toxicity did not exceed grade 3. Highest genitourinary toxicity at most recent follow-up was grade 2, present in 12% and 14% of IMRT and SBRT patients, respectively.

SBRT in post-prostatectomy setting, however, has been minimally investigated. A major concern for this setting is the highly deformable nature of adjacent organs-at-risk (OARs) and prostate bed clinical target volume (CTV). We report a volumetric and dosimetric analysis of kilovoltage cone-beam CT (CBCT) data from 18 patients enrolled on a phase II clinical trial of post-prostatectomy SBRT. We hypothesized that with instructions on bladder filling and rectal preparation, we could achieve acceptable CTV coverage and avoid overdosing OARs. Materials/Methods: Eighteen patients receiving 5 fractions of 6-6.8 Gy to prostate bed were included. Patients received instructions on bladder filling and rectal preparation, specifically to urinate 60 minutes and drink 16-24 oz of water prior to treatment, as well as take enemas the night and morning before treatment. CBCT prior to each fraction was taken for anatomic verification and image guidance, and a second CBCT halfway through treatment for intrafractional motion analysis. CBCTs were imported into a deformable registration algorithm. Prostate bed CTV and OARs were contoured for each image. Percent changes in inter and intrafractional volume and mean dose change were calculated for all structures; V95 was also calculated for each CTV. Result(s): Interfractional volumetric and dosimetric changes are summarized in Table 1. CTV volume was relatively constant (median change +5.7% [IQR -1.7% to + 9.8%]) as was CTV V95 (median change -0.74% [IQR -9.2% to -0.1%]). Rectal volume showed greatest change between treatment sessions and treatment plan, with median change of +21.0% [IQR +5.1% to 34.6%]. Intrafractional volumetric and dosimetric changes were overall nonsignificant. Among 11 patients with at least 3 months follow-up, there was one instance of acute grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity by CTCAE 4.03, and no instances of grade 2 genitourinary toxicity. So far, one patient had biochemical failure which may be due to an out of field relapse. All others have had PSA response. Conclusion(s): Dosimetric and volumetric data from this prospective trial indicate CTV coverage is well maintained without overdosing OARs despite the highly deformable anatomy involved with post-prostatectomy SBRT. Acute toxicity is favorable, though longer follow-up and more patients are needed to evaluate late toxicity and efficacy.

MTD was the highest dose where <33% of the patients experienced DLT. PB-SBRT was delivered using volumetric arc intensity modulated radiation therapy with kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography prior to each fraction. Fiducial markers were placed in the prostate bed prior to simulation. An air-filled rectal balloon was inserted for simulation and treatment. Dose constraints to bladder and rectum were modeled after a previous prostate SBRT trial (PMID 21464418). Result(s): Accrual started in October 2013 and is ongoing. All 14 patients who enrolled have successfully completed treatment. Three patients were treated on L1, 7 on L2, and 4 thus far on L3, with respective median follow-up of 20 months, 7 months, and 3 months. Toxicity data are listed in Table 1. Acute Grade 2 GI events were seen in 5 patients (L1, hemorrhoid; L2, proctitis, hemorrhoid, and flatulence; L3, proctitis). Four patients had acute grade 1 urinary urgency which self-resolved. No grade 3 or higher acute events have been observed. No patients experienced grade 2 or higher late toxicity. The median pre-SBRT PSA was 0.44 (range 0.26-1.52). The median time between surgery and SBRT was 21 months (range 9-97). Seven patients had positive margins (L1, n = 2; L2, n = 3; L3, n = 2). ADT was given to 4 patients (L2, n = 3; L3, n Z 1). Biochemical control (PSA <0.2) is reported by dose level: L1, 1/3; L2, 6/7; and L3, 4/4. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge this is the first 5-fraction PB-SBRT trial conducted in human subjects. Final dose of 45 Gy was reached without grade 3 or higher toxicity. The feasibility of this technique was demonstrated with acceptable acute safety profile. Updated results with additional patients and longer follow-up will be presented. (Table Presented).",exclusion,Other study design (phase I),,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2016.06.1197,,,

Material and Methods Patients (pts) eligibility: Stage T2-3, N0, M0, Gleason Score>=6, prostate specific antigen (PSA)<= 50, prostate volume <= 70 cm3, international prostate symptom score (IPSS)<= 15, visible tumor/s at multiparametric (mp) MRI. Pts underwent the placement of a rectal spacer and a 3T MRI post- spacer insertion for planning purposes. Primary endpoint: Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) defined as grade 3 or worse gastrointestinal (GI) and/or genitourinary (GU) toxicity by CTCAEv.4 within 90 days from the start of treatment. Main secondary endpoints: PSA, quality of life (QLQC30, PR-25 bowel and sexual activity modules and IPSS questionnaires evaluation), and immunological responses before and after treatment. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of human leucocyte antigen serotype A2 positive (HLA-A2+) pts were stimulated with PSMA, PSA, PSCA or PAP-derived peptides and tested for the release of interferon gamma (IFNgamma) by ELISpot. Results Between 2014 and 2016, a total of 12 pts (5 high-risk and 7 intermediate-risk according to the D'Amico classification) were included in groups of 3. Pts received 45 Gy, 47.5 Gy, and 50 Gy in five fractions to the mpMRI visible dominant nodule/s. 11 pts were treated in CyberKnife and 1 patient in Tomotherapy. DLTs were not observed and thus MTD was not reached. Three additional patients were treated in the 50 Gy cohort without DLT. GI and GU toxicities by grade, cohort, and time point are summarized in Table 1. The median follow-up is 18.5 months (m) (range10 to 31 m). PSA control is 91.66% by the nadir + 2 ng/mL failure definition. The average (+/-SD) of the QoL assessments at baseline and at 3 m posttreatment for all patients were 83 (+/- 8) and 73 (+/-21) for QLC30 (mean difference, 10; 95% CI, 1.82-19.2), 1.4 (+/-4.8), and 5.9 (+/-8.4) for PR25 bowel module (mean difference, 4.51; 95% CI, 0.10-8.91), 42.4 (+/- 25) and 36.2 (+/-25.6) for PR25 sexual activity module (mean difference, 6.01; 95% CI, 0.2-12.39), and 6.5 (+/- 4.4) and 7 (+/-5) for IPSS (mean difference, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-1.3); respectively. ELISpot assay of 8 pts detected 5 pts with increase in the IFNgamma secretion to HLA-A2-restricted prostate cancer peptides PSA, PSCA, PSMA or PAP. Conclusion Irradiation of the whole prostate with 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions and dose escalation to 50 Gy to the dominant nodule has been completed without DLT. QoL analysis showed moderate impact in GU, GI and sexual domains. Longer follow-up will be necessary to confirm these preliminary results. A phase II trial is underway treating patients to 50 Gy in five fractions to the dominant nodule.

To increase this tumor response, immune targeting agents can be combined with SBRT We hypothesize that the anti-PDLI agent Durvalumab will enhance immune response following SBRT targeting oligometastatic lesions. In this multicenter randomized phase II trial, we therefore propose to assess the comparative efficacy of SBRT with or without Durvalumab (MEDI4736) in oligometastatic recurrent hormone sensitive prostate cancer patients. Method(s): Patients with PCa were eligible if they had a biochemical recurrence following treatment with curative intent, with a maximum of 5 bone or lymph node metastases, seen only on FCH-PET CT or Ga-PSMA PET CT, not seen on conventional imaging assessments (bone scan or thorax, abdomen and pelvis CT scan). Main exclusion criteria are serum testosterone level < 8.5 nmol/ml, PSA doubling time less than 6 months, lung, brain, liver or other visceral metastases, any prior immune therapy. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to either SBRT + Durvalumab, or SBRT alone, with a stratification by investigation center, and number of metastases (1 vs 2-5). Durvalumab (1500 mg/cycle) will be started one month prior to SBRT to be able to evaluate PSA and immune response to the drug. It will be combined with SBRT (3x 9 or 3 x 11 Gy) and then given adjuvantly until progression with a maximum of 12 months. Ninety-six patients will be recruited in 15 centers over a recruitment period of 2.5 years. The primary endpoint is two-year Progression-free survival.

Proposed mechanisms include vascular injury of adjacent internal pudendal arteries (IPA), penile bulb (PB), corpora cavernosa (CC) or neurovascular bundles (NVB). Ability to spare these structures has been limited by a presumed need to treat the entire prostate gland, while also preventing rectal injury. Recent innovations have challenged this issue: a) precise dose delivery with stereotactic ablative RT (SAbR), b) improved spatial mapping of clinically significant disease with mpMRI, c) rectal avoidance with rectal spacer use. Method(s): POTEN-C is a multi-center phase II randomized control trial, which includes men with a) low-intermediate risk prostate cancer eligible for SAbR without ADT, b) potent by sexual composite score >60 on EPIC patient-reported quality of life instrument, c) mpMRI delineated disease (PIRADS v2 score 3-5) >5mm to at least one 'spared' NVB. After placement of rectal spacer gel and CT/MRI simulation, men are randomized to standard SAbR to 40-45Gy/5fx or neurovascular-sparing SAbR. In the sparing experimental arm, the prostate PTV is given 30Gy/5fx excluding unilateral 'spared' NVB, while a 40-45Gy PTV further excludes a 5mm protective shell on the unilateral 'spared' NVB+IPA+PB+CC. Centralized rapid review of initial contours/plans and online training materials are integrated. The primary endpoint is 2-year patient-reported potency, measured by EPIC sexual composite score. We hypothesize that neurovascular sparing SAbR will reduce 2-year EPIC score decline from a control of 20 to 10 (corresponding to a MCID). Assuming standard deviation 20, two-sided significance level 0.10 with two-sample t-testing, and 15% attrition, we intend to enroll 120 patients to provide 80% power to detect this difference. Secondary endpoints include sexual medication/aid use, relapse rates, GU/GI toxicity. Enrollment is ongoing.

Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has emerged as an effective treatment for localized prostate cancer. However, prostate specific antigen (PSA) kinetics after prostate SBRT have not been well characterized. The purpose of this study was to analyze the trend in PSA decline following robotic SBRT from a prospective cohort of patients. Material and methods. In total 175 patients were treated definitively for localized prostate cancer to a dose of 35-36.25 Gy in 5 fractions using robotic SBRT in the absence of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). PSA and testosterone were collected at regular intervals following treatment and patients were assessed for biochemical failure and benign PSA bounce. A PSA nadir threshold of 0.5 ng/ml was used as a predictor of long-term disease-free survival. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the effect of disease specific covariates on the likelihood of achieving a PSA nadir less than threshold. PSA kinetics were analyzed a multi-component exponential model accounting for benign and malignant sources of PSA. Results and conclusion. At a median follow-up of 3 years, 70% of patients achieved a PSA nadir below 0.5 ng/ml with a median PSA nadir of 0.3 ng/ml at a median time to nadir of 30 months. In our cohort, 36.2% experienced a benign PSA bounce. Absence of PSA bounce, initial PSA, and testosterone at the time of nadir proved to be significant predictors of achieving a PSA nadir below threshold. PSA kinetics after prostate SBRT were well described with a functional volume model with fitted half-lives of 4.4 and 14.8 months for malignant and benign sources of PSA, respectively. Patients treated with prostate SBRT experience an initial period of rapid PSA decline followed by a slow decline which will likely result in lower PSA nadirs after longer follow-up. The long-term disease specific impacts of these results remain to be determined.Copyright © 2014 Informa Healthcare.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/0284186X.2014.983656,,,

Methods and materials: Eligible patients included men with biopsy-proven prostate stage T1c to T2c adenocarcinoma, a Gleason score <=7, and prostate-specific antigen values of <=20 ng/mL, who had at least 1 focal lesion visible on MRI and a total prostate volume no greater than 120 cm3. SBRT consisted of a dose of 36.25 Gy to the entire prostate with an SIB of 40 Gy to the MRI-defined lesions, delivered in 5 fractions. The primary purpose of the study was to confirm the feasibility of treatment planning/delivery and to estimate the rate of urinary retention requiring placement of a Foley catheter within 90 days of treatment. This study was to be considered successful if urinary retention occurred in no more than 15% of cases, with a planned enrollment of at least 25 patients. Result(s): A total of 26 men were enrolled, and all underwent SBRT as planned. Twenty patients (77%) had intermediate-risk features, and the remainder were low risk. A treatment plan that met the protocol-defined goals for all cases was developed. Two patients (7.7%) developed acute urinary symptoms that required the temporary placement of a Foley catheter. No grade 3+ toxicity events were observed. Conclusion(s): Planning and delivery of prostate SBRT with a whole prostate dose of 36.25 Gy and a focal 40 Gy SIB is feasible.

However, prostate specific antigen (PSA) kinetics after SBRT has not been well characterized. The objective of the current study is to analyze the rate of PSA decline and PSA nadir following SBRT boost after whole pelvis radiotherapy (WPRT) in intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer. METHODS: From March 2008 to July 2014, 42 patients newly diagnosed, intermediate- and high-risk (NCCN definition) localized prostate cancer were treated with SBRT boost using Cyberknife after WPRT. The whole pelvis dose was 45 Gy (25 fractions of 1.8 Gy) and the SBRT boost dose was 21 Gy (3 fractions of 7 Gy). No one received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) before biochemical relapse. PSA nadir and rate of change in PSA (slope) were calculated and compared. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 53.6 months (range, 14-74), the median rates of decline of PSA were -0.605, -0.229 and -0.166 ng/mL/month, respectively, for durations of 1, 2 and 3 years postradiotherapy, respectively.

Many patients are diagnosed at an early stage. The standard treatment for early stage of prostate cancer (prostate cancer confirmed to the prostate) is operation-radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy-external beam or/and brachytherapy. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) can also be used for this kind of patients. A prospective one-center clinical study was done on localized prostate cancer patients with lowand intermediate-risk (according to NCCN). Patients received 33.5 Gy in 5 fractions twice a week in on average 15 days (according to SHARP trial). PSA levels were obtained before treatment and every third month. Putative failure was defined as nadir plus 2 ng/mL according to Phoenix definition of PSA failure. Acute toxicity assessments were performed according to RTOG/EORTC score. This analysis was performed on 68 prostate cancer patients T1c-T2cN0M0 (age, mean 72.5 years; median, 73 years). For 16 patients (23.5 %) who did not receive androgen deprivation therapy, the median pre-treatment PSA was 7.53 ng/mL (mean 8.55 ng/mL). The PSA response has been favorable. For those who did not receive androgen deprivation therapy the median PSA level 3, 12 and 24 months after treatment was 2.8, 1.6, and 0.4 ng/mL, respectively. Median nadir PSA for patients without hormone treatment was 0,6 ng/mL (mean 0,7 ng/mL), median time to nadir PSAwas 15 months (mean 16 months). At 24 months follow-up there were no patients with PSA failure (nadir+ 2 ng/mL), only five patients demonstrated PSA increase from nadir of more than 0.2 ng/mL. The tolerance of treatment was good.

Aim of the study was to demonstrate the feasibility of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy with the CyberKnife System and to determine local tumor control and failure patterns. Method(s): After diagnosis of nodal relapse, PET/CT guided stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) was done using the CyberKnife System and x-sight spine tracking. Treatments were performed between May 2015 and October 2016 and applied prescription doses were 3 x 10 Gy, 1 x 19 Gy, 6 x 7 Gy, or 3 x 8 Gy (65% isodose level). PTV included PET-positive lesions only. Initially, all patients had high-grade prostate cancer (initial mean PSA value 34.3 ng/ml) and were treated by radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymphonodectomy. In case of increased PSA after robotic radiosurgery, PSMA-PET/CT scan was carried out to evaluated the local control rate. Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) was not mandatory. Result(s): Nine pelvic and paraaortic lesions in seven patients were treated. Mean age was 71 years. Mean follow up time was six months (1-12 months). Three patients received ADT before, during and after SBRT, one patient received ADT until PSA-value dropped down after SBRT. No local relapse was seen so far. Four patients showed signs of progression (outfield lymphatic progression or PSA-elevation). One of them received ADT at time of lymphatic progress. Mean time to metastatic progression was 6.5 months. Mean PSA-value before SBRT was 3.66 ng/dl and dropped to 1.86 ng/dl at last follow-up. Treatment related toxicity was mild. Conclusion(s): PSMA-PET/CT guided SBRT for patients with nodal relapse of prostate cancer after primary surgical treatment showed excellent local control.

random-journal.pdf,ProP209,"H., Zakaria",2016,English,5 study;pro.m:#1;pro.p:#1,Psoas size predicts survival in patients with lung cancer metastasis to the spine,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Patient frailty has been defined as a decreased reserve to resistance to stressors, with decline across multiple physiologic systems, and is a common endpoint in human senescence. For a surgeon, the clinical appreciation of a frail patient is important, as a recent body of literature has shown that frailty can predict morbidity and mortality after general, vascular, transplant and neurological surgery. Unfortunately, measuring human frailty is subjective, burdensome, and impractical in most clinical settings, and so surrogate markers of frailty, namely sarcopenia, has been successfully used to predict postoperative morbidity and mortality following major neurosurgical, general, vascular and transplant surgery. Morphometrics is the measurement of patient attributes that are indicative of sarcopenia, and thus frailty by proxy. In terms of oncologic surgery, the observation has consistently been that patients who are sarcopenic, not only have increased postoperative morbidity and mortality, but also have a shorter progression free survival. The relationship with increased muscle mass and disease free survival has even been observed in oncologic patients who have not undergone any cancer surgery. This is an important observation, as current methodologies for predicting oncologic outcomes rely solely on histologic grade of the cancer and its TNM tumor staging. Identifying more accurate and specific markers of survival would enable oncologists to better identify which patients are appropriate candidates a specific treatment, whether it is chemotherapy, radiation, surgery or palliation. PURPOSE: In this study, we applied morphometric analysis of sarcopenia to predict oncologic outcomes in patients who have lung cancer metastases to the spine. In our previous work, we have applied this methodology to lumbar spine surgery using psoas area as a marker for sarcopenia. Our hypothesis was that patients with smaller psoas area would have shorter survival after being diagnosed with metastasis to the spine in patients with primary lung cancer. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Utilizing a retrospective registry of spinal metastases patients from 2002-2012 who have undergone stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the spinal column, we identified a population of patients all who had primary lung cancer diagnoses. This included all histological subtypes of lung cancer. OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome of interest was overall survival, which was measured from the date of the patient's scan (MRI or CT) to date of death. For patients who were still alive at the time of analysis, survival was calculated to the most recent documented follow-up. The median survival (in days) along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval were computed for all patients, as well as subsets of interest. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were done to estimate the hazard ratios and test for differences in the variables of interest. METHOD(S): Using previously proven methodology, circumferential morphometric measurements were taken of the psoas muscle at the L4 vertebral body. Measurements were taken from spinal CT or MRI at the time of SBRT for metastases. Psoas muscle sizes were ultimately divided into tertiles according to total psoas area. RESULT(S): A total of 178 patients with lung cancer spinal metastases were identified. Ninety-eight patients (55%) were males, and 95 (53%) presented with multiple level metastasis. The median survival for all patients was 156 days (95% CI=116-197 days). The associations of overall survival with gender and the number of levels were not significant. However, the association of overall survival with type of scan was significant (p<.001), with patients receiving an MRI having shorter survival compared to patients receiving CT. Psoas muscle area measurements were divided into tertiles, with adjustments accounted for gender differences in muscle size. When considering the total psoas tertiles based on gender only, the difference between the lowest and highest tertiles was significant (p=.033) with patients in the lowest tertile having shorter survival (115 days, 95% CI=85-67) compared to patients in the highest tertile (253.5 days, 95%CI=158-337). In addition, patients in the lowest tertile had significantly (p=.022) shorter survival as compared to the middle and highest tertile combined (188.5 days, 95% CI=127-254). The differences for the total psoas tertiles based on gender and type of scan and ratio of total psoas to vertebral body area tertiles were not significant. CONCLUSION(S): Our results illustrate that morphometric analysis of psoas size may be predictive of survival in patients with lung cancer metastasis to the spine. The other notable statistical finding in this study is that the type of scan available for morphometric analysis showed that patients who had an MRI were at risk with a significantly shorter survival. This may be due to treatment regimens after imaging, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy. We did find that patients who had an MRI compared to CT did have lower mean psoas size. Given the retrospective nature of this study and non-standardized imaging protocols, it will be difficult to account for potential bias that reflects this finding. However, our study does show the potential of morphometric measurements as a surrogate for survival in this specific population. Future multicenter prospective study will be required to fully validate this methodology. In addition, our methods can also be applied toward other cancer subgroups (breast, prostate, GI, etc.) for future study as well.",exclusion,Other tumor treated (spinal),,PM155,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spinee.2016.07.376,,,

Quality of life (QoL) is of substantial importance in the metastatic setting, since treatments have historically been considered palliative-intent. However, randomized data assessing the longitudinal QoL impact of SABR in the oligometastatic setting are lacking. Herein we report longitudinal QoL outcomes from the SABR-COMET randomized trial. Materials/Methods: We enrolled patients who had a controlled primary malignancy with 1-5 metastatic lesions, all of which were amenable to SABR, with good performance status and life expectancy >6 months. We stratified by the number of metastases (1-3 vs. 4-5) then randomized in a 1:2 ratio between standard of care (SOC) treatment [SOC Arm] vs. SOC plus SABR to all metastatic lesions [SABR Arm]. Due to the wide variety of tumor sites and treatment targets included, QoL was measured using a general tool, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G), which includes 4 subscales: Physical Well Being, Social/Family Well Being, Emotional Well Being, and Functional Well Being. A 5-point decline in the total FACT-G scale, or a two-point decline on a subscale, is generally considered a clinically meaningful change (CMC). QoL changes over time and between groups was assessed with linear mixed modeling. Result(s): Ninety-nine patients were randomized (33 in Arm 1, 66 in Arm 2). Median age was 68 (range: 43-89) and 60% were male. The most common primary tumor types were breast (n=18), lung (n=18), colorectal (n=18) and prostate (n=16). Most patients (n=92) had 1-3 metastases. Median follow-up was 26 months. Because of the inferior survival of the SOC arm, as previously reported, the time for attrition in QOL respondents to <10% of subjects was shorter in the SOC vs SABR arm (30 vs. 42 months). In the whole cohort, QoL declined over time after randomization: there were significant declines in total FACT-G score over time compared to baseline (p<0.001), due to declines in physical and functional subscales (both p<0.001), with no declines in social and emotional subscales. However, the magnitude of declines were small, and CMCs were not seen at most time points. Comparison between arms showed no differences in QoL between the SABR and SOC arms in total score (p=0.42), or in the physical (p=0.98), functional (p=0.59), emotional (p=0.82) or social (p=0.17) subscales. Conclusion(s): For patients with oligometastases, average QoL declines slowly over time regardless of treatment approach, although the changes are small in magnitude. The use of SABR, compared to SOC, was not associated with a QoL detriment. This suggests that QoL changes are due to underlying disease processes over time.

Fiducial markers are routinely placed in the prostate for image guidance. Changes in fiducial marker position could be used as a surrogate for prostate displacement during treatment. Here, we examine changes in intrafractional fiducial position during SBRT using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and ""on-demand"" image guidance. Purpose/Objective(s): At our institution, patients with localized prostate cancer exhibiting MRI positive lesions are offered enrollment onto a prospective clinical trial in which they receive an MRI guided SBRT boost (21 Gy/3 fx) using VMAT after a course of IMRT (45 Gy). In this analysis, we reviewed 7 patients treated on this protocol. Prior to CT simulation, all patients had three prostatic fiducials placed. SBRT boost was delivered in three fractions over 1.5 weeks. kV cone beam CT was performed prior to treatment delivery for image guidance. A kV on-board imager was used to obtain kV projections (10-12/arc). Measurements were made to obtain each fiducial's position on an X, Y, and Z coordinate system. Absolute positions and relative changes in fiducial marker geometry between projections were analyzed. Intrafraction repositioning of the patient was triggered when fiducials were found to be outside the 3 mm threshold based on ""on-demand"" kV imaging. CBCT was then performed to realign the patient. We analyzed the percentage of instances in which the fiducials would have remained inside the threshold margin in the absence of image-guided intrafraction couch repositioning. Result(s): Based on 1071 intrafractional data points, we found that the maximum center of mass intrafractional translation was 3.98 mm in the AP axis, 4.17 mm in the SI axis and 1.76 mm in the LR axis. Imaging triggered patient repositioning reduced the percentage of observed fiducials that would have moved outside the 3 mm threshold by 9.6% (from 17.5% to 7.9%) in the SI axis (Table) while it had little effect on the percentage of observed fiducials outside the 3 mm threshold in the LR or AP axes. The spatial resolution of the imaging method was accurate to <1 mm. Conclusion(s): Our data indicates that in the absence of intrafraction repositioning, portions of the PTV would have spent 17.5% of the treatment time > 3 mm from their planning position. Due to intrafractional movement, positioning the patient exclusively based on the pre-treatment CBCT scans is insufficient to ensure complete target coverage. Intrafractional on-demand imaging is required to ensure adequate coverage to the PTV.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.06.1125,,,

Prostate plans were created using 10 MV 3D-CRT (78 Gy in 39 fractions) and 6 MV 5-field IMRT (78 Gy in 39 fractions), VMAT (78 Gy in 39 fractions, with standard flattened and energy-matched FFF beams) and SABR (42.7 Gy in 7 fractions with standard flattened and energy-matched FFF beams). Dose-volume histograms from pelvic planning CT scans of three prostate patients, each planned using all 6 techniques, were used to calculate organ equivalent doses (OED) and excess absolute risks (EAR) of second rectal and bladder cancers, and pelvic bone and soft tissue sarcomas, using mechanistic, bell-shaped and plateau models. For organs distant to the treatment field, chamber measurements recorded in an anthropomorphic phantom were used to calculate OEDs and EARs using a linear model. Ratios of OED give relative radiation-induced second cancer risks. SABR resulted in lower second cancer risks at all sites relative to 3D-CRT. FFF resulted in lower second cancer risks in out-of-field tissues relative to equivalent flattened techniques, with increasing impact in organs at greater distances from the field. For example, FFF reduced second cancer risk by up to 20% in the stomach and up to 56% in the brain, relative to the equivalent flattened technique. Relative to 10 MV 3D-CRT, 6 MV IMRT or VMAT with flattening filter increased second cancer risks in several out-of-field organs, by up to 26% and 55%, respectively. For all techniques, EARs were consistently low. The observed large relative differences between techniques, in absolute terms, were very low, highlighting the importance of considering absolute risks alongside the corresponding relative risks, since when absolute risks are very low, large relative risks become less meaningful. A calculated relative radiation-induced second cancer risk benefit from SABR and FFF techniques was theoretically predicted, although absolute radiation-induced second cancer risks were low for all techniques, and absolute differences between techniques were small.",exclusion,Other study design,,,10.1088/0031-9155/60/3/1237,,,

Antigen-specific immune responses have also been shown for prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy. We examined whether RITI can be induced in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following proton radiotherapy. METHODS: Pre- and post-radiotherapy plasma samples from 26 patients with nonmetastatic NSCLC who received radiotherapy between 2010 and 2012 were evaluated by western blotting for IgG and IgM bands to assess RITI response to tumor antigens from lung cancer cell lines. Statistical analysis was used to evaluate any correlation among IgG or IgM and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients received proton therapy at 2 GyRBE/fraction (n = 17) or 6-12 Gy/fraction (n = 4); five received photon therapy at 2-2.5 GyRBE/fraction. Compared with the pretreatment baseline, new IgG or IgM binding was detected in 27% and 50% of patients, respectively. New IgG bands were detected in the 25-37 kD, 50-75 kD, and 75-100 kD ranges. New IgM bands were detected in the 20-25 kD, 25-37 kD, 37-50 kD, 50-75 kD, and 75-100 kD ranges. There was no difference in IgG and/or IgM RITI response in patients treated with photons versus protons, or in patients who received SBRT compared to standard fractionation (P > 0.05). There was no difference in overall survival, metastasis-free survival, or local control based on IgG and/or IgM RITI response (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: RITI can be induced in patients with NSCLC through upregulated IgG and/or IgM. RITI response was not associated with proton versus photon therapy or with clinical outcomes in this small cohort and should be examined in a larger cohort in future studies.",exclusion,Other tumor treated (lung),,PM158,10.1111/1759-7714.13122,,,

New imaging-modalities have increased the diagnosed patients with limited number of metastasis after primary curative therapy, introducing so-called oligometastatic state. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is emerging as a low-toxicity treatment to erase PCa localizations and postpone androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). A deeper understanding of the predictive role of biomarkers is desirable for a targeted treatment selection and surveillance programs. The aims of the RADIOSA trial are: 1. Compare SBRT +/- ADT for oligorecurrent-castration-sensitive PCa (OCS-PCa) in terms of efficacy, toxicity and Quality of Life (QoL). 2. Develop biology/imaging based prognostic tool that allows identifying OCS-PCa subclasses. Method(s): This is a randomized phase II clinical trial, recruiting 160 OCS-PCa in 3 years, with progression-free survival (PFS) as primary endpoint. Three tasks will be developed: 1. Randomized clinical study (3 years for accrual and 2 years for follow-up and data analysis); 2. Imaging study, including imaging registration and METastasis Reporting and Data System (MET-RADS) criteria; 3. Pre-clinical study, development of a biobank of blood samples for the analysis of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and preparatory for a subsequent miRNA profiling. We aim to determine which arm is justified for testing in a subsequent Phase III trial. A decision-tree algorithm, based on prognosis, biological phenotype and imaging profile, will be developed. Discussion(s): Recruiting will start in July 2019. SBRT will allow obtaining excellent PFS, local control, QoL and low toxicity. In SBRT arm, ADT deferral will allow for a drug-holiday, delaying the detrimental impact on QoL. A sufficient number of blood samples will be collected to perform biological patient profiling. A stratification tool will be established with an analysis of morphological and functional imaging, based on the use of MET-RADS criteria. So, in conclusion, RADIOSA aims to define the optimal management of bone/nodal PCa relapses in a SBRT regimen. This study will increase our knowledge on low-burden metastatic PCa in the era of high precision and high technology personalized medicine, offering highly effective therapy in terms of clinical outcome and cost-effectiveness.

Bone metastases are the most common site of oligometastatic disease thus targeting the bone niche may help prevent spread of oligometastatic and micrometastatic disease. Radium 223 dichloride acts as a calcium mimetic targeting active areas of bone turnover observed in osteoblastic lesions. It is FDA approved for treatment of bone metastases in the castrate resistant prostate cancer setting but its role in castrate sensitive oligometastatic prostate cancer remains unknown. Based on the bone targeting mechanism of action of radium 223 we hypothesized that the combination of SBRT and Radium 223 would improve the therapeutic effect on both oligometastatic and micrometastatic bone disease in patients with oligometastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer. 9 months of standard androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with LHRH agonist was chosen as systemic therapy throughout treatment with SBRT and Radium223 dichloride as was used in our prior oligometastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer trial and based on lack of definitive evidence indicating benefit of intensification of hormonal therapy or chemotherapy in that setting. Method(s): Design: phase II single arm study. Treatment: 9 months of ADT, SBRT to all oligometastatic sites (<=4), and Radium 223 (1 course = 6 cycles). Eligibility Criteria: oligometastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer including bone. 10Endpoint: Time to treatment failure. Assessment will involve both PSA and radiographic progression. 2nd Endpoint: Safety of adding Radium 223 to SBRT and ADT for oligometastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer. Follow-up: 5 years. Statistics: We are hypothesizing median time to treatment failure (TTF) of 25 months in the current study exceeding other prior reports and a 9 month improvement over historical data from our prior City of Hope (COH) oligometastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer trial.

No data was available in Australia, and international data was limited. As a department initiative we introduced real time data collection at the time of consultation across a number of tumour streams including prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to review our data integrity and our ability to link data with other units. Method(s): We tested the hypothesis that increased acute radiation toxicity may represent a genetic link to radiation repair and hence improved local control. All patients treated with definitive RT were included. The primary endpoint was biochemical control at 5 and 7 years as a surrogate for local control. After testing this hypothesis, data was combined for a planned multicentre pooled analysis with The Christie Cancer Centre, Manchester and The Sylvester Cancer Centre, University of Miami. Result(s): There were 504 patients from RNSH included in the initial study. The 5 year and 7 year BFS for patients with and without acute radiation toxicity was 84.6% vs 83.5% and 84.6% vs 69.3%, respectively. Although non significant, there was a separation of the BFS curves starting at approximately 5 years which was a strong signal to proceed with the pooled analysis. This included 196 patients from Miami and 478 patients from The Christie, a combined cohort of 1,178 patients. With increased numbers the results were significant (p = 0.0004) with a BFS advantage at 7 and 10 years for patients with acute toxicity vs those without acute toxicity.

In a multi-institutional prospective trial, we investigated whether real-time IGRT improved the accuracy of the dose patients with prostate cancer received during radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-eight patients with prostate cancer were treated with KIM-guided SABR with 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions. During KIM-guided treatment, the prostate motion was corrected for by either beam gating with couch shifts or multileaf collimator tracking. A dose reconstruction method was used to evaluate the dose delivered to the target and organs at risk with and without real-time IGRT. Primary outcome was the effect of real-time IGRT on dose distributions. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported outcomes and toxicity. RESULTS: Motion correction occurred in ≥1 treatment for 88% of patients (42 of 48) and 51% of treatments (121 of 235). With real-time IGRT, no treatments had prostate clinical target volume (CTV) D98% dose 5% less than planned. Without real-time IGRT, 13 treatments (5.5%) had prostate CTV D98% doses 5% less than planned. The prostate CTV D98% dose with real-time IGRT was closer to the plan by an average of 1.0% (range, -2.8% to 20.3%).

In the TROG 15.01 Stereotactic Prostate Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) with KIM (SPARK) trial, KIM was used to enable real-time target tracking in a multi-institutional setting. We test the primary hypothesis that real-time target tracking improves prostate dose distributions. Material(s) and Method(s): Forty-eight men with prostate cancer were treated with KIM-guided SABR delivering 36.25 Gy to the prostate in five treatments. During treatment the prostate (target) motion was corrected in real-time by implementing KIM-guided beam gating with couch shifts or multileaf collimator tracking. A dose reconstruction method was used to evaluate the dose to the target and organs at risk (OARs) with real-time KIM target tracking. The same dose reconstruction method was used to evaluate the dose that would have been delivered without real-time target tracking. Thus, all cases acted as their own internal controls. A treatment was considered a success if the target and rectal dose with real-time target tracking were closer to the planned dose than the target and rectal dose estimated without real-time target tracking. The prostate dose was represented by the dose to 95% of the planning target volume. The rectal dose was represented by the rectal volume receiving above 30 Gy. The trial was designed with 90% power and 95% confidence to rule in a KIM success rate of 2/3 in favour of the futility rate of 1/3. Result(s): Motion correction via beam gating or multileaf collimator tracking occurred in 51% (121/235) of the treatments where real-time target tracking was performed. The proportion of motion-corrected treatments with an improvement in dose distribution to both the prostate and rectum was 72% (87/121 treatments), significantly higher than the 33% prospectively defined futility cutpoint (p<0.0001, x2). The prostate dose with KIM was closer to the plan by an average of 4.6% (range -1.7% to 41%). The rectal dose with KIM was closer to the plan by an average of 1.5% (range -1.2% to 9.7%).

Optimal tumor control rates can only be achieved with high local doses, associated with a considerable risk of rectal toxicity - regarded as dose-limiting toxicity. Apart from already widely adapted technical advances, as intensity-modulated radiation therapy and image-guided radiotherapy techniques, the application of spacers placed between the prostate and anterior rectal wall has been increasingly used in the last years. Biodegradable spacers, including hydrogel, hyaluronic acid, collagen or an implantable balloon can create the desired effect. They can be injected or inserted in a short procedure under transrectal ultrasound guidance via a transperineal approach. A distance of about 1.0-1.5cm is usually achieved between the prostate and rectum, excluding the rectal wall from the high isodoses. Several studies have shown well tolerated injection procedures and treatments. Apart from considerable reduction of rectal dose compared to radiotherapy without a spacer, clinical toxiciyt results are favourable. A prospective randomized trial demonstrated a reduction of rectal toxicity after hydrogel injection in men undergoing prostate image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy.

Material(s) and Method(s): In a dose escalation (Phase I) study, previously irradiated patients were enrolled in two different arms depending on treatment site and previous dose: 1) retreatment with previous dose > 60 Gy or retreatment of pancreatic and pelvic tumors, 2) retreatment with previous dose < 60 Gy. SBRT was delivered in 5 fractions with static 3D technique (4 non-coplanar beams) or dynamic arc (VMAT). The dose was prescribed at the isocenter. The Planning Target Volume (PTV) was defined as the GTV + 5-15 mm margin. According to the study arm, the first cohort of 6 patients received a dose of 20 or 25 Gy, and subsequent cohorts of patients received doses up to 40 Gy. The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any acute and late toxicity Grade >= 3. The MTD was defined a s the dose level with 2/6 or 4/12 DLT. Result(s): From September 2004 to December 2014, 51 patients (M/F: 27/24; median age 65, range 44-87), previously irradiated with doses of 30 to 87 Gy (median dose 50 Gy) were enrolled, after 4-228 months from the first treatment (median 11 months). Sixty-six lesions were treated (23 primary lesions or relapses, 43 lymphadenopathies) mainly from gynecological tumors (30%), followed by gastrointestinal tumors (26%) and prostatic tumors (17%). Nineteen of the 66 lesions were in the neck or chest, 22 in the abdomen and 25 in the pelvis. With a median follow-up of 19 months (3-104), an overall response rate of 81% (Complete Response: 55%, Partial Response: 26%), with only 3% of disease progression was recorded. At 40 Gy dose-level, only 1 patient showed DLT (cutaneous fistula in the sacral region). Two-year local control was 75% and 2-year metastasis-free survival was 30%. Conclusion(s): SBRT treatment in 5 fractions up to a dose of 40 Gy is well tolerated in previously irradiated patients. This dose escalation protocol is still ongoing (Table 1).

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients affected by previously irradiated prostate cancer were enrolled in this reirradiation study if they had a biochemical relapse and a (11)C-choline positron emission tomography scan revealing the presence of a local recurrence of disease. Reirradiation consisted of a stereotactic treatment delivered by image guided radiation therapy-volumetric modulated arc therapy with flattening filter-free technology in 5 daily fractions. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients underwent reirradiation to the prostate, prostatic bed, or prostate and local recurrence. Re-treatment consisted of a median total dose of 25 Gy in 5 fractions. A biochemical response was observed in all cases. Acute toxicity was mainly genitourinary (GU) grade 1 to 2 (n = 13; 56.5%). One patient (4.3%) had grade 3 hematuria. A grade 1 GU late toxicity was registered in 4 patients (17.4%) and grade 3 in 1 patient (4.3%, urethral obstruction). Gastrointestinal toxicity was negligible. Regression analysis showed that only a short elapsed time in months from primary radiation therapy was significantly correlated with acute GU toxicity. After a median follow-up of 33 months (range, 5-58 months), the median biochemical recurrence-free survival was 19 months, and the 2-year biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) was 41.7%. Median local control was 30 months; the 2-year local control rate was 58.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Reirradiation of patients with prostate cancer who underwent previous radiation therapy is a valuable option that can be safely considered to delay the beginning of hormonal treatment.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.02.041,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This institutional review board-approved retrospective review included 162 patients (237 reirradiated spine lesions). All patients received SRS at our institution between 2001 and 2013. Electronic medical records were reviewed for clinical exams and radiologic tests (computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging). Primary endpoints were pain, neurological, radiographic responses, and the development of adverse effects. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients (74.1%) were deceased with a median survival of 13 months. Time between courses of RT was a median of 10.2 months. Median SRS dose was 16 Gy in 1 fraction, whereas the median conventional external beam radiation therapy (cEBRT) dose was 30 Gy in 10 fractions. The median tumor equivalent dose in 2-Gy fractions (EQD2) for SRS doses was 34.7 Gy, whereas the median tumor EQD2 for cEBRT was 32.5 Gy, providing a median total tumor EQD2 of 69.3 Gy (22-145.6 Gy). The median critical nervous tissue EQD2 for SRS and cEBRT was 56 Gy and 37.5 Gy, respectively, resulting in a median total critical nervous tissue EQD2 of 93.5 Gy. Overall pain, neurological, and radiographic response rates were 81%, 82%, and 71%, respectively. Adverse effects occurred in 11 (6.8%) patients. Seventy-seven vertebral compression fractures were observed, 22 (9.3%) of which may be attributed to RT. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that reirradiation achieves favorable response rates with minimal toxicity if recommended dose constraints to the spinal cord with SRS are carefully observed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest reported single-institution experience analyzing the efficacy and toxicity of reirradiation of the spine when at least 1 course of RT is stereotactic radiosurgery.",exclusion,Other tumor treated (spinal),,,10.1016/j.prro.2017.05.007,,,

Focal robotic stereotactic body radiotherapy (rSBRT) to the recurrent intraprostatic tumor is emerging as a valuable option in this setting. In this retrospective study, we evaluated efficacy and toxicity of robotic SBRT for exclusive local failure after primary EBRT. Patients and Methods: Data from 28 patients treated at our Institution from September 2012 to December 2015 with rSBRT for prostate cancer recurrence after definitive EBRT were retrospectively reviewed. Local intraprostatic recurrence was assessed by 18 F-choline positron-emission tomography- computed tomography (PET); a dose of 30 Gy was delivered in 5 fractions. PSA was assessed at 2 months, 6 months, and every 4 months following rSBRT. Toxicity was assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events toxicity scale (CTCAE v.4.03). Result(s): Patients were stratified into low (n=5, 17.9%), intermediate (n=9, 32.1%) and high-risk group (n=14, 50.0%) at diagnosis. Median patient age at rSBRT was 78.5 (62-86) years. All patients received prior EBRT for a median total dose of 76 Gy (62-80 Gy) in 2 (1.8- 3.1) Gy/fraction. Median time from primary treatment to relapse was 74.1 (19.3-149.2) months. Five patients were receiving androgen-deprivation therapy following prior biochemical failure; median pre-treatment PSA value was 2.7 (2.1-14.4) ng/ml. Twenty-five patients showed biochemical response to treatment at 2 and 6 months, median PSA decline was 54.0% (2.2-95.0%) and 76.0% (35.9-95.0%) respectively; three patients experienced early PSA progression at 2 and 6 months, median PSA elevation was 112.3% (20.0-204.5%) and 267.0% (41.9-309.1%), respectively. At the time of our analysis, after a median follow-up of 20.9 (6.3-49.2) months, 10 patients showed no evidence of disease, two continued androgen deprivation with stable PSA levels, while 10 patients experienced biochemical relapse; among them, metastatic recurrence occurred in four cases. Biochemical progressionfree survival (bPFS) was 96.4% and 75.0% at 12 and 18 months, respectively. Rectal and bladder acute toxicity grade 1-2 was found in four and one case, respectively; grade 1-2 late rectal and bladder toxicity occurred in one and seven cases, respectively. One patient experienced both grade 3 acute and chronic bladder toxicity, consisting of acute urinary retention and hematuria respectively. At univariate and multivariate analysis of pre-treatment variables, impaired bPFS was correlated only with high-risk category at diagnosis (hazard ratio=13.06, p=0.021). No predictive factor for improved bPFS was found at subset analysis in responding patients, although a trend was observed for PSA decline at 6 months >76.0% (p=0.06). Conclusion(s): Focal rSBRT can achieve long-lasting remission and delay initiation of hormone treatment, in particular in low-/intermediate-risk patients at diagnosis, with acceptable late toxicity.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,PM171,,,,

Thus, localizing the residual disease after surgery is crucial to precisely define the planned target volume (PTV) of salvage radiotherapy (SRT). Objective(s): to evaluate the impact of 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT on SRT planning in BCP patients. Material(s) and Method(s): Design: 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT is performed in our institution through a prospective, single-center, open-label study (prot. P-5315) in hormone-na?ve PCa. We performed a retrospective sub-analysis in BCP patients matching these inclusion criteria: 1) RP as primary therapy; 2) PSA-nadir >0.1 ng/mL at 8 weeks after RP; 3) No adjuvant/salvage therapy or hormonal-therapy performed after RP; 4) all patients considered eligible for SRT in prostate bed; 5) PET scan performed within 12 months from RP. Changes in clinical management and SRT planning were defined by a singlecentre multidisciplinary tumour board. Population characteristics: twenty-eight (n=28) patients matched all inclusion criteria and were analysed. ISUP grade <=3 (n=11/28), >=4 (n=17/28); stage >=pT3a (n=17/28); pN1 (n=7/28); R1 (n=16/28). Median/mean PSA-nadir=0.34/0.48 ng/mL (0.1-3.3); median/mean PSAdt=2.8/7.1 months (0.6-44.6); median/mean PSAvel=0.8/3.1 ng/mL/year (range 0.1-24.7). Result(s): Overall results: 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT detection rate was 57.1% (CI95% 37.4%-75.0%). Median/mean PSA at time of imaging=0.53/1.06 ng/mL (range 0.22-8.9). Prostate bed relapse only was detected in 3.6% of cases. Intra-pelvic relapse (pelvic lymph-nodes with/ without prostate bed) was detected in 21.4%,.The presence of at least one extra-pelvic lesion (extra-pelvic nodes and/or bone) was detected in 32.1%. of cases. Oligometastatic disease (1-3 PSMA positive lesions) was detected in 53.6% of cases. SRT planning: in 46.4% of patients (13/28), SRT in prostate bed was confirmed as intended before PET scan. In 53.6% of patients SRT planning was changed: 7/28 patients performed SRT in prostate bed and additional stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) on PET positive findings. In 2/28 cases PTV was modified including only PET positive pelvic nodes without standard radiotherapy in prostate bed. SRT was aborted in 5/28 patients and ADT was administrated instead. In 1/28 case SRT was aborted and pelvic lymph-node dissection was performed. Conclusion(s): In this patient-series, 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT proved its role in BCP setting detecting disease outside prostate bed in 53.5% of cases and SRT planning was modified due to the integration of 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT results into the decision-making process. These data may suggest the presence of extended disease not detected by conventional imaging prior to surgery and highlight the importance of PET imaging in BCP setting.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,PM178,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00259-019-04486-2,,,

METHOD(S): We retrospective identified 74 patients with rrPCa (2010-2016). Of those, 54 (73 %) vs. 20 (27 %) were previously treated with EBRT vs. BT. All patients with rrPCa were diagnosed with PSA raising and choline PET (showing non-metastatic disease), or multiparametric MRI followed by prostate biopsy in both groups. Overall, 29 (40%) vs. 45 (60%) patients were treated with S-RARP vs. S-RT. All S-RARP were non Nerve Sparing with extended bilateral pelvic limph node dissection, while S-RT patients underwent intensity modulated or stereotactic radiation therapy on the prostate with a 25 to 30 Gy dose divided in 5 to 6 fractions. Kaplan-Meier plots depicted progression free (PFS), cancer-specific (CSS) and overall (OS) rates over time in S-RARP vs. S-RT patients. The cut off for Biochemical Relapse (BCR) after S-RT was assessed as PSA nadir after RT + 2 ng/ml, according to the Philadelphia criteria, while for S-RARP was 0,1 ng/ml. RESULT(S): Compared to S-RARP, patients treated with S-RT were older (75.8 vs. 67 years; p=0.001). Overall, 16 (55%) vs. 23 (52%) and 13 (45%) vs. 22 (48%) patients treated with S-RARP vs. SRT had a primary diagnosis of ISUP GG1 and ISUP GG 2 PCa before primary RT (p=0.7). Median time from primary RT to salvage treatment was, respectively, 65.5 (IQR 26.55 - 90.15) vs 102.6 (IQR 78.4 - 130.6) months for S-RARP vs S-RT (P= 0.001). Median time follow-up after salvage treatment was 41.5 months. Overall, 11 (39.3%) vs. 22 (56.4%) patients had biochemical recurrence after S-RARP vs. S-RT (p=0.1). Moreover, CSM and OCM rates were, respectively, 0(0 %) vs. 6 (13 %) (p=0,04) and 0 (0 %) vs. 6 (13 %) (p= 0,04) in patients treated with S-RARP vs. S-RT. CONCLUSION(S): S-RARP and S-RT appears to achieve the same rates of cancer control in patient swith radio-recurrent prostate cancer after primary RT.

The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the acute and late toxicity rates, in salvage stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) as a treatment modality in nodes oligo-recurrence, from prostate cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): Between February 2013 and March 2015, 21 patients, for a total of 29 isolated lymph nodes from prostate cancer, were treated with SBRT, delivered with Truebeam Stx (Varian), at UPMC San Pietro FBF radiotherapy center of Rome. The median age at primitive diagnoses was 65 (range 50-74) years. For the primary treatment, radical prostatectomy and postoperative irradiation, exclusive radiotherapy or prostatectomy was performed in 12 (57%) patients, 7 patients (33%) and 2 patients (10%), respectively. Median previous RT dose was 72 Gy/35 fractions. Median PSA at the time of recurrence was 2.04ng/ml. All patients with arising PSA underwent a [11C] choline-positron emission tomography before SBRT, in order to exclude other sites of disease. The SBRT dose varied from 27 to 30 Gy, in 1-5 daily fractions, according to the previous RT treatment for the primitive lesion or a close organ at risk. A daily cone-beam CT and X-ray (BRAINLAB ExacTrac) scans were acquired before each treatment session, for every patient. Acute and late toxicity were analyzed, according to CTCAE toxicity scale (v. 4.0). Result(s): The median follow-up was 14.5 months. Most of patients received 30 Gy, in 3 fractions, on alternative days: all the patients completed the prescribed SBRT treatment. Fifteen patients (71%) received androgen deprivation therapy concomitant to SBRT. SBRT was well tolerated: only 1 patient experienced G2 acute rectal toxicity but we didn't observe any severe acute or late toxicity ( >=G3). Despite the short follow up, local control was 100%, distant control was 79% (6/21). All these recurrences were nodal and all out of SBRT field: in 2 of these 6 patients a new SBRT course was delivered (30 Gy in 3 fractions) while in the other hormonal therapy was proposed. At the moment of analysis, all patients were alive. Conclusion(s): Our experience shows that SBRT for isolated nodal relapse from prostate cancer is a safe treatment, offering a low toxicity profile and an excellent tumor local control.

A UK randomised phase III trial,"Introduction: Traditionally stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) have been used for prevention or palliation of symptoms. Mostly retrospective and single-arm studies have been published recording the safety of SABR/SRS, local control rates and survival with the addition of radical radiotherapy or SABR to all sites of disease in the first-line setting. Primary disease sites in these studies include NSCLC, melanoma, prostate and colorectal cancer. A recent North American study showed adding local consolidative therapy to standard systemic therapy improved progression-free survival. We are conducting the first randomised phase III trial to investigate the impact of conventional and SABR/ SRS in patients with oligometastatic NSCLC. Method(s): SARON is a randomised, multicentre, non-blinded phase III trial for patients with synchronous oligometastatic NSCLC (1-3 metastases). Patients suitable for radical treatment with performance status 0-2 will be randomised 1:1 to receive either standard chemotherapy (Control) or standard chemotherapy plus radiotherapy to all sites of disease (Investigational). Patients will have imaging scans at baseline to include a full body PET-CT and a brain CT/MRI with subsequent follow-up scans at months 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 post-chemotherapy. The primary endpoint is overall survival, secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, disease control, new distant metastasis-free survival and quality of life. A feasibility assessment will be made after 50 patients have been randomised. A safety sub-study will assess the use of conventional radiotherapy to the primary tumour plus SABR to thoracic metastases. The study is powered to detect an improvement in median survival from 9.9 to 14.3 months. Result(s): The trial was activated in August 2016 and is currently recruiting. In total, 340 patients will be recruited from 30 sites over 3 years.

Material(s) and Method(s): Exclusion criteria were T3b-4, GS 9- 10, PSA >=50, IPSS >=20. Since 2012 eighty-two patients were treated: 41 HR (23/41 with GS>= 8 or PSA >20 or T3a, and 18/41 with >=2 intermediate risk factors), 17 IR (GS 7 or PSA 10-20 or T2b-c), and 24 LR. 57/82 patients received 6-month hormonal therapy (HT). 8 fractions of 5.65 Gy for HR-IR, and 5.48 Gy for LR patients were delivered every other day over about 2.5 weeks. EQD2 is 92.3 Gy (HR, IR) or 87.4 Gy (LR) for prostate cancer (a/b 1.5), and 78.2 or 74.3 Gy for late-responding tissues (a/b 3), respectively. Result(s): Median follow-up was 13.7 months (0.3-40.1). No acute/late grade >=3 events were observed. Late GU or GI grade 2 toxicities were far bellow 10% (see Table). We observed a slight urinary flare at 18 months. IPSS scores (Q1-7) and patient satisfaction (Q8) returned to baseline at 6 months (p=0.21), after they significantly worsened at the last fraction (p=0.00), especially the IPSSobstructive component (see Figure). Without HT, PSA nadir has not been reached yet. Mean value at 24 months was 0.66 ng/mL. With HT, PSA nadir was reached between 1-6 months and then raised up to 0.37 ng/mL average at 18 months (mean testosterone 291 ng/dL), to remain steady afterwards. No biochemical (nadir+2) /clinical failure was found. One unrelated cancer/treatment death occurred during SBRT. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge this is the first communication of SBRT using helical tomotherapy for localized prostate cancer. The 8-fraction scheme is being well tolerated, with no moderate-severe toxicity, suggesting that this approach is safe. Longer follow-up is needed to find out whether the delivery of equivalent doses near the plateau of the dose-response curve (>90 Gy) results in better tumour control in this cohort of patients (mostly HR and IR tumours).

In fact, given the low alpha/beta ratio of prostate cancer, the delivery of very high radiation doses in few fractions, may even improve the therapeutic ratio in the treatment of this disease. This phase II study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of SBRT in a series of patients with low or intermediate risk prostate cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): Biopsy confirmed prostate cancer patients were enrolled in this phase II trial, provided that they had the following characteristics: iPSA < 20 ng/ml, Gleason Score < 7, IPSS < 7. The treatment schedule was 35 Gy in 5 fractions, delivered every other day with VMAT technology in FFF modality. Toxicity was recorded according to CT-CAE criteria v3.0. Biochemical failure was calculated according to the Phoenix definition. Result(s): Between December 2011 and March 2015, 90 patients were enrolled (53 low risk, 37 intermediate risk). The median age was 71 years (range 48 - 82 y). The median Gleason Score was 6 (range 6-7) and the median initial PSA was 6.9 ng/ml (range 2.7 - 17.0). Acute toxicity was mild, with 32.2 patients presenting a G1 urinary toxicity and 31.1% of patients presenting a G2 urinary toxicity, mainly represented by urgency, dysuria and stranguria. A rectal G1 toxicity was found in a 15.5% of patients, while a rectal G2- toxicity was recorded in 6.6% of patients. Regarding late toxicity, a G1 proctitis was recorded in 11.1% of patients and a G1 urinary (urgency, cystitis) in 38.8%; only 2 events of G2 urinary toxicity were observed (transient urethral stenosis, resolved by a 24-hour catheterization). At a median follow up of 27 months (range 6 - 62 months) only two intermediate risk patients experienced a biochemical failure (22 and 24 months after radiotherapy, respectively). PET Choline revealed a nodal recurrence in one patient who underwent a further stereotactic radiotherapy and is now free of disease. In the other patient a local recurrence was diagnosed, associated to bone progression (rib), therefore the patient started ADT. Compliance to treatment was good, as reported by the EPIC questionnaires, which revealed a slight worsening in the urinary domains during treatment, with a return to baseline three months after treatment.

As such, balancing the benefits of treatment against the effects of therapy on elderly patients is essential. The EORTC QLQ-ELD14 (ELD-14) is a validated questionnaire with a domain dedicated to burden of illness and treatment in the elderly. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)-26 is a validated questionnaire which measures urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal symptoms. This study reports trends in self-reported burden in patients with prostate cancer treated with SBRT and reveals convergence of self-reported burden with treatment related side effects obtained from the EPIC-26 questionnaire. Method(s): All patients >=70 years old, with localized prostate cancer treated with SBRT +/- ADT at Medstar Georgetown University Hospital from 2013 to 2018 and had completed the ELD-14 were eligible for inclusion in this cross-sectional cohort study. Percentage of responses to questions related to disease and treatment burden were counted for each category (""not at all"" and ""a little"" vs. ""quite a bit"" and ""very much""). Additional demographic features were derived from available medical records. A total of 111 patients (median age of 74) responded to the ELD-14 questionnaire at onset of treatment and at the 2-year mark. Responses to EPIC questionnaires at matched follow-ups were scored and correlated with the self-reported burden domain of the ELD-14 using the Spearman correlation coefficient. Result(s): Number of patients reporting ""quite a bit"" or ""very much"" burden from prostate cancer was 6.3% prior to treatment. This was highest at 1-month (10.8%) and decreased to 9.0% at 24 months post-SBRT (X2 = 3.836, p = 0.6986). By comparison, 3.6 and 5.4% reported ""quite a bit"" or ""very much"" burden from treatment at start of treatment and 24 months, respectively (X2 = 1.046, p = 0.9838). Patient reported treatment burden was found to converge well with individual domains of EPIC-26. Patients undergoing ADT experienced more burden than their non-ADT counterparts. Conclusion(s): This cross-sectional study suggests a minority of patients reported high burden from their clinically localized prostate cancer or from their SBRT treatment. Self-reported burden converged well with lower EPIC scores in multiple domains.© Copyright © 2020 Aghdam, Pepin, Carrasquilla, Johnson, Danner, Ayoob, Yung, Lei, Collins, Kumar, Suy, Lynch and Collins.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2019.01528,,,

One third of all cancer patietns will develop brain metastases, so this entity is one of the most frequent seen by radiotherapists. Patients with brain metastases do still have a very poor prognosis, the grade prognostic assessment (GPA) is a clinical score to estimate the prognosis based on karnofsky performance score (KPS), number of lesions and extracranial metastases. But so far there are no serologic markers corelating with the damage to the brain both by growing lesions and radiation. The glial protein S100 and neuron specific enolase (NSE) both are used in the clinical setting to evaluate brain damage after traumatic brain injury and ischemic oder hemorrhage stroke. At Klinikum rechts der Isar we do now conduct a study evaluating S100 and NSE serum levels during the course of radiation therapy. (VONES100) Methods: Patients with brain metastases receiving whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) or stereotactic fractionated radiation (SFR) post resection are included in this study. Additionally we include patients undergoing propylactic cranial irradiation. Number and volume of metastases are evaluated. All patients are clinically examined (KPS and neurologic deficits) and S100 and NSE are measured right before the first and after the last fraction. Result(s): So far 7 patients (4 females, 3 males) are inrolled into this study. Mean age was 63.1 years (39-77), 5 patients were receiving whole brain radiation therapy, one patient underwent fractionated radiation post tumor resection and one patient received PCI. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was the predominant primary tumor, other entities were renal cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, prostate cancer and acute lymphatic leukemia. In the WBRT group mean number of irradiated lesions was 3.5 (1-9), mean volume was 1.2 ml (0.21-3.1 ml), one patient had large dura-attached lesions with a volume of 94.1 ml. Average S100 level was 120.7 pg/mL (38-278 pg/mL), in 4 patients (80%) S100 serum level increased in mean by 49.5% (26.3-71.9%) during the period of radiation, only in one patient undergoing WBRT S100 level decreased by 14.6% while NSE declined by 12.9% (12.2 to 10.8 ng/mL). During PCI S100 was elevated by 120% (45-109 pg/ mL), but NSE deceased by 24.1% (10.8 to 8.2 ng/mL). The were no new neurologic deficites during the treatment period, 2 patients received dexamethason due to headaches. Conclusion(s): This study is evaluating serum levels of S100 and NSE during radiation therapy of brain metastases. So far we could demonstrate an increase of S100 during radiation therapy to the brain, but larger numbers are needed for clinical relevance and outcome correlation.",exclusion,Other tumor treated (brain),,PM185,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00066-017-1137-6,,,

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is one of the new radiotherapy methods. The aim of the study was to analyze tumor control of prostate cancer patients treated with SBRT. METHODS: A prospective single-institution clinical study was conducted among previously untreated patients with histologically confirmed localized prostate cancer. Patients were treated with SBRT: 33.5 Gy in 5 fractions. RESULTS: A total of 68 men with clinical stage of prostate cancer T1c-T2cN0M0 were included in the study. The median combined Gleason score was 6, the median PSA level was 10ng/mL. The median follow-up period was 48 months. Five years after the end of radiotherapy, the median PSA levels were as follows: 0.29ng/mL for all patients, 0.39ng/mL for those who did not receive androgen deprivation therapy, 0.25ng/mL for patients who underwent 6 months and 0.31ng/mL for patients who underwent 2-3 years of hormone therapy. Median nadir PSA levels were 0.025ng/mL for all patients and 0.48ng/mL for patients without hormone therapy. Low PSA nadir (<0.5ng/ml) was noted in 50% of patients without hormone therapy and in 70% of all other patients. Only in 4 patients (out of those who did not receive hormone therapy) PSA failure was observed (nadir plus 2ng/mL). No cases of PSA failure were noted among patients who underwent 6 months or 2-3 years of androgen deprivation therapy.

This study aimed to investigate the toxicity of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) and QoL after treatment in localized prostate cancer patients. Material(s) and Method(s): A prospective single-center clinical study was performed in low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients. Patients received 33.5 Gy in 5 fractions (SHARP regimen). Acute and late toxicity was assessed according to RTOG/EORTC score. Patients filled out EORTC QLQ-C30 and prostate cancer-specific QLQ-PR25 questionnaires. Result(s): The analysis included 68 prostate cancer patients (55-83 years, median 73) with clinical stage T1c-T2cN0M0, median combined Gleason score of 6 (3-8), and median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 10 ng/mL (4-20 ng/mL). Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy was given to 52 patients (76.5 %), and stopped in 31 patients (45.5 %) after 6 months; in 21 patients (31 %) after 2-3 years. Average and median follow-up was 24 months (18-45). Median nadir PSA level was 0.03 ng/mL for all patients and 0.6 ng/mL for patients without hormone treatment. No patients had PSA failure. There were no acute grade IV toxicities. One patient (1.5 %) developed grade III and 24 patients (35.3 %) grade II acute bladder toxicity. No one developed grade III and 7 patients (10.3 %) grade II acute rectal toxicity. No grade III or IV late gastrointestinal or genitourinary toxicities were reported. Grade II late urinary symptoms were observed in 8 patients (11.8 %) and gastrointestinal symptoms in 3 patients (4.4 %). Global health status/QoL was good and improved during the observational period. Conclusion(s): SBRT for prostate cancer patients is a well-tolerated treatment in terms of toxicity and QoL, has no negative impact on functioning and everyday life, with the important benefit of a short treatment period.

Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 93 cT1-3a N0 M0 prostate cancer patients with a lymph-node involvement risk <= 20% were randomized between September 2012 and October 2014 to be treated with an SBRT protocol of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy either over 9 days (Arm A, n=45) or over 28 days once-a-week, the same week-day (Arm B, n=48). The dose to the prostatic urethra with a surrounding margin of 3 mm (urethral planning risk volume, uPRV) was reduced to 32.5 Gy in 5 fractions (NTD2Gy of 74 and 62 Gy for an alpha/beta ratio of 1.5 and 3 Gy, respectively). Tolerance to the treatment was scored using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events ver. 4.0 grading scale, the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and the EORTC QLQ-PR25 quality of life (QoL) questionnaire. Thirty-seven patients in Arm A and 38 patients in Arm B have completed treatment. Their follow-up (FU) extended up to 18 months and in Arm A 70% has reached their six month evaluation, while 60% of the patients in Arm B did. Result(s): SBRT was delivered to all patients as planned with no treatment interruptions. Overall genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicities were below the stopping rule established for the study, with grade 2 toxicity reported in 6 patients for each arm mostly after the 5th fraction. Only one patient experienced late grade 3 rectal toxicity, with the need of blood transfusion and endoscopic coagulation for the bleeding, between the 7th and 12th month FU. Mean IPSS scores increased significantly between baseline and the 5th fraction (p<0.01) in both treatment arms, returning to baseline at week 12. Mean IPSS values at baseline, after the 5th fraction and after 12 weeks were 7.5, 14 and 7.5 for Arm A and 8.1, 12.7 and 8.9 for Arm B, respectively. No significant differences were observed in EORTC QLQ-PR25 QoL endpoints between baseline and week 12 in either study arm.

Materials/Methods: From 08/2017 through 12/2018, 6 patients from two among the 5 participating institutions with low- and intermediate-risk localized PCa (cT1c-2cN0M0, Gleason <=3+4, PSA <=15 ng/ml, with <=70 cc prostate volume and without significant tumor in the transitional zone) were recruited and treated with a 19 Gy single fraction to the prostate +/- seminal vesicles (PTV= CTV + 5 mm isotropic expansion, except 3 mm posteriorly) using a VMAT technique and intrafractional motion control using intraprostatic electromagnetic transponders. The prostatic urethra, with a surrounding margin of 2 mm, received a lesser dose of 17 Gy. Genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (CTCAE v4.03 grading scale), IPSS, IIEF-25 and QOL scores (EPIC) were assessed at baseline, at 5 days (D5), 6th (W6) and 12th weeks (W12) (acute toxicity) since SBRT. Primary endpoint of the phase I was safety as assessed by occurrence of Grade >=3 acute side effects during the first 3 months in a ""3 + 3"" cohort-based. Result(s): Median age and PSA at SBRT were 75 years old and 8.1 ng/ml. All patients underwent SBRT without interruption and doses constraints were respected for all plans. The toxicity stopping rule was never triggered, with no Grade >=3 acute side effects observed during the first 3 months. Patients experienced mostly grade 1 or 2 GU toxicities (frequency/urgency) resolving from W6 (50% of grade 2 GU) with no grade 2 GI side effects and no rectal toxicity at W12 (33% of grade 1 GI). IPSS increased from baseline to D5 and W6 (mean, from 3.5 to 13.2 and 16.2, respectively) decreasing progressively at W12 (mean, 7.2). The EPIC urinary domain mean score was 92 pretreatment, 73 at D5, 79 at W6 and 87 at W12, while the EPIC bowel domain mean score remained overall stable over weeks (95, 91, 85, 90 at the four endpoints). No impact of SBRT was observed on IIEF-25 scores and the EPIC sexual domain between baseline and W12 (mean, from 10 to 9 and from 46 to 44, respectively). The PSA values showed a bounce at D5 (mean, from 7.9 to 18.3 ng/ml) decreasing successively up to a value of 3.3 ng/ml at W12. Conclusion(s): 19 Gy single-fraction SBRT irradiation of the whole prostate with urethra sparing to 17 Gy was feasible and well tolerated.

However, there is no solid evidence about the optimal treatment schedule and no comprehensive understanding of the adverse events. In this study, we sought to compare two most widely used SSRS schemes (single fraction versus three fractions) in patients with spinal metastasis who did not previously undergo radiation treatment at the site of the SSRS and tried to evaluate the toxicity profile as well as predictive factors regarding outcomes and the risk of complications after SSRS. Material and Methods Patients were prospectively enrolled in the singleinstitution randomized study. Dose regimen was singlefraction of 16-Gy versus 3-fraction of 24-Gy. The primary objective is the rate of 4-month grade 3 or higher adverse events definitely, probably or possibly related to treatment. Spinal Instability Neoplastic Scoring (SINS) system were incorporated into the protocol to predict the adverse event of each anticipant. Local control was determined by serial post-treatment image scans. Results Between 2015/11 and 2017/5, SSRS was performed in 23 sites on 20 patients (including 18 lung cancer patients, 1 breast cancer patient and 1 prostate cancer patient). The median age was 58 years (range 45-79). The median KPS was 80 (range 70-100). Of the 23 sites, 20 were single level targets. Thoracic spine (n = 15) and lumbar spine (n=7) were the most common sites. Single fraction radiosurgery was delivered in 11 patients while 3-fraction regimen was delivered in 9 patients. Median follow-up was 11.03 months (95% confidence interval: 8.26-13.81 months). At 4 months, no patient experienced any grade 3-5 toxicity. Pain flare was not reported in the irradiated sites. There was no evidence of vertebral body fracture related to the SSRS in any patient in the treated area. Conclusion Both single fraction and three fraction SSRS could provide durable and favorable pain and local control for patients who have previously unirradiated spinal metastasis with mild/tolerable toxicity profile.",exclusion,Other tumor treated (spinal),,PM187,,,,

Nelfinavir is a HIV protease inhibitor that may potentially act as a radiosensitizer. We performed a Phase II study of nelfinavir concurrent with SBRT in pts with solid tumor oligometastases to determine 6-month (6mo) freedom from local progression (FFLP). Secondary endpoints include safety, overall survival (OS), freedom from distant metastasis (FFDM) and progression-free survival (PFS). Purpose/Objective(s): Pts with <=5 histologic confirmed metastatic lesions (<= 5.0 cm or <=250 cm3) of lung, liver, lymph nodes, or bone, and good performance status (ECOG <= 2) were eligible. Pts were given 1250 mg of nelfinavir twice daily for 7 days prior to and after a single dose of 15 Gy SBRT per lesion. Responses were evaluated based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. Result(s): A total of 38 pts were accrued between January 2014 and December 2015. One withdrew consent and 37 were included in the analysis, with a median follow-up of 18 months (range 5-31.5 months). The median patient age was 65 (range 35-81 years), 62% were men, and 51% and 22% had prostate and sarcoma as primary histologies, respectively. The majority of pts had <=3 lesion sites (54% had 1 lesion, 22% had 2, and 16% had 3), and had recurrence sites at bone (57%) or lung (24%). The 6 mo FFLP rate was 78.4% (95% CI: 61.4-88.5%). Among the 68 treated lesions, the 6mo FFLP rate by lesion was 76.5% (95% CI: 64.5-84.9%). There were a total of 3 deaths due to disease progression. The 18 mo rates of OS, FFDM, and PFS were 90.7% (95% CI: 73.8-96.9), 62.4% (95% CI: 43.9-76.3), 57.6% (95% CI: 39.7-72.0), respectively. The 6 mo FFLP rate for patients with prostate cancer was 100% compared to 63% for patients with sarcoma (P < 0.0003). There were 4 grade 3 adverse events that may have been related to treatment (e.g., absolute lymphocyte decrease, anxiety, nausea, and cough). Conclusion(s): SBRT can be delivered safely with nelfinavir. Overall 6 mo FFLP rate for the entire cohort was not significantly higher than historical controls, although this may be secondary to tumor histology, treated site, and lesion number. Prostate cancer patients had significantly improved clinical outcomes relative to sarcoma patients and thus one may hypothesize that certain histologies may require a higher SBRT dose for local control. Further research should be conducted into the optimum patient cohort to benefit from the concurrent use of radiosensitizers with SBRT.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,PM188,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.06.544,,,
random-journal.pdf,ProP244,"Lyons, C",2016,English,pro.p:#5,SPORT high-risk trial: A randomised feasibility study evaluating stereotactic prostate radiotherapy in high-risk localised prostate cancer with or without elective nodal irradiation,"Background: Prostate Cancer (PC) has a low alpha-beta ratio, making it sensitive to hypofractionated radiotherapy. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) provides an opportunity for dose escalation beyond that achievable with conventional radiotherapy. Additionally, there is a lack of novel biomarkers in use in the management of localized PC. Method(s): Thirty men with high-risk node-negative PC (at least one of PSA > 20 ng/mL, T3a, Gleason score >= 4 + 3) will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive SABR to the prostate (P) and proximal seminal vesicles (SV) alone (36.25 Gy/5#) or to the addition of elective pelvic nodal irradiation (ENI) (25 Gy/5#). All men will be treated using a volumetric arc therapy solution with intra-prostatic fiducial markers, a prostate-rectal spacer device and cone-beam CT-based image- guidance. Result(s): The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of performing a randomised trial comparing P/SV SABR to the addition of ENI SABR in men with high-risk localised PC. This will be measured via distinct endpoints: adequate recruitment rate (30 patients in 24 months), number of plans delivered as planned and on schedule, and quantification of acute toxicity to enable calculation of the sample size for a subsequent Phase II trial (CTCAE v4.03). Secondary objectives include quantification of late toxicity and quality of life scores and assessment of PC outcomes post-SABR. Tertiary and exploratory outcomes include the biobanking of clinically annotated tissue, a health economic analysis, assessment of multiple biomarker candidates, measurement of fatigue, and assessment of the impact of prostate spacer placement. Conclusion(s): SABR provides scope for dose escalation in men with high-risk localized PC. The role of ENI has not been determined. Furthermore, this trial offers an additional opportunity for novel biomarker investigation in localized PC.",exclusion,Not the right comparator,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejso.2016.07.076,,,

Objective(s): To perform a matched-case analysis in men with lymph node recurrent PCa comparing standard of care (SOC) with metastasis-directed therapy (MDT). Design, setting, and participants: PCa patients with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression following multimodality treatment were included in this retrospective multi-institutional analysis. Intervention(s): The SOC cohort (n = 1816) received immediate or delayed androgen deprivation therapy administered at PSA progression. The MDT cohort (n = 263) received either salvage lymph node dissection (n = 166) or stereotactic body radiotherapy (n = 97) at PSA progression to a positron emission tomography-detected nodal recurrence. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The primary endpoint, cancer-specific survival (CSS), was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, Cox proportional hazards models, and propensity score-matched analyses. Results and limitations: At a median follow-up of 70 (interquartile range: 48-98) mo, MDT was associated with an improved CSS on univariate (p = 0.029) and multivariate analysis (hazard ratio: 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17-0.64) adjusted for the year of radical prostatectomy (RP), age at RP, PSA at RP, time from RP to PSA progression, Gleason score, surgical margin status, pT- and pN-stage. In total, 659 men were matched (3:1 ratio). The 5-yr CSS was 98.6% (95% CI: 94.3-99.6) and 95.7% (95% CI: 93.2-97.3) for MDT and SOC, respectively (p = 0.005, log-rank). The main limitations of our study are its retrospective design and lack of standardization of systemic treatment in the SOC cohort. Conclusion(s): MDT for nodal oligorecurrent PCa improves CSS as compared with SOC.

The incidence varies between 20 and 85% depending on the primary cancer. Breast, prostate, and lung cancers are responsible for 70% of bone metastases. Cancer with bone metastases compared to other metastatic sites is considered as associated with a better prognosis, particularly for breast and prostate cancer. Bone metastases may be present at diagnosis (synchronous metastasis) or appear at a later time (metachronous metastasis). The concept of ""oligometastases"" was proposed in patients with about 3 up to 5 metastases (without restriction on the primary site) and associated with an intermediate prognosis. It was hypothesized that local treatment with curative intent, aiming at the few metastatic sites, would yield long‐term survival probabilities, along with systemic therapies. Long‐term survivors have been reported after curative‐intent treatment of metastasis in sarcoma and colorectal cancers with liver or lung metastasis. We chose to focus on bone metastasis because of their high incidence, their impact on the patient's quality of life and autonomy, and their accessibility to potentially curative radiotherapy. The systemic treatment of metastatic cancer includes hormonal therapy (breast and prostate cancer), biologically‐targeted drugs and chemotherapy (all cancers). Stereotactic radiotherapy is a highly accurate technique was initially developed for performing the radiosurgery of brain tumors in patients for whom it was deemed be too difficult to proceed to classical excision surgery. In this process, a high total dose of radiation is delivered in a single fraction to a well‐defined intra‐cranial target. The concept of radiotherapy in stereotactic conditions was extended to one or several fractions delivered to small volumes primary tumors/ metastases in extra‐cranial sites (Stereotactic Body RadioTherapy [SBRT]). At present, high control rates have been achieved for lung metastases. Similarly, very high local control rates have been reported in bone metastases after stereotactic radiotherapy. In this protocol, our purpose is to demonstrate, via a randomized phase III trial, that high doses of radiotherapy, delivered in stereotactic conditions to the bone metastases (between 1 and 3 metastases) in solid tumor patients is able to improve the survival without progression.",exclusion,Other tumor treated (skeletal),,PM194,,,,

Short-term androgen deprivation therapy (STADT) is the standard of care for men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with conventionally fractionated RT but the majority of SABR data in men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer is without ADT and no prospective trials have exclusively examined STADT with prostate SABR in intermediate-risk men. We hypothesized STADT would enhance the efficacy without significantly worsening toxicity or quality of life (QOL). Materials/Methods: Eligible patients were >18 years old with histologically and radiologically confirmed localized prostate cancer meeting D'Amico intermediate-risk criteria (T2b-T2c, PSA 10-20 ng/mL, Gleason 7). Exclusion criteria included International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) > 15, prior radical prostatectomy or pelvic RT, chemotherapy within 5 years, inflammatory bowel disease, and significant comorbidity. Patients received 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy over 2 weeks via volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with daily cone-beam CT (n = 45) or robotic radiosurgery (n = 1). Gold fiducials were used in 36 patients. STADT was 4 months LHRH agonist plus >=2 weeks bicalutamide beginning at least 1 month prior to radiotherapy. The primary objective is 5-year biochemical failure free rate with failure defined as nadir + 2 ng/mL. Secondary objectives include CTCAE v4.0 adverse events (AEs) and self-reported QOL data including IPSS, Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM), and Extended Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) bowel domain. Result(s): From 8/2013 and 10/2017, 45 patients were treated across 3 institutional sites (1 lost to follow-up). Median follow-up is 23 months. Eight patients experienced grade 2 hot flashes and 2 experienced grade 2 diarrhea on treatment; 2 experienced grade 2 urinary frequency/urgency at 3 months post-treatment. No other grade 2 AEs occurred in more than one patient per time point. One patient experienced a grade 3 myocardial infarction at 4 months post-treatment; no other grade 3 or higher AEs were noted. There were two patient deaths not attributable to prostate cancer or study interventions. Median IPSS at baseline was 7 (IQR 3.75-10) which increased to a maximum of 10 (IQR 7-15) at 8 months and was 7 (IQR 3.75-9) at most recent follow-up. Median SHIM at baseline was 5.5 (IQR 2-19.5) which decreased to a minimum of 1 (IQR 1-2.25) at 7.5 months and was 2 (IQR 1-15) at most recent follow-up.

The importance of consolidating all macroscopic tumor deposits in prostate cancer in the modern era is an unanswered question. Stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR) is highly focused, high-dose radiation that is ideally suited for treatment of oligometastatic patients. Here we report on the safety and preliminary clinical outcomes of a modern cohort of oligometastatic prostate cancer (OPC) patients treated with consolidative SABR at a single institution. Materials/Methods: Records of all men with OPC, defined as up to 5 metastases (bone, lymph nodes and viscera) diagnosed on imaging (bone scan, CT, MRI or PET), who underwent consolidative SABR at our institution were reviewed. Demographic, pathologic, clinical and concurrent-adjuvant therapy data were collected from our IRB approved departmental prostate cancer radiation therapy registry. SABR was delivered in 1-5 fractions of 5-18 Gy using linear accelerator or robotic stereotactic technology. Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess local progression-free survival (LPFS), biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS; nadir+2) and distant progression-free survival (DPFS). Result(s): In total, 46 OPC patients were identified with 16 (35%) of those men presenting as synchronous OPC undergoing complete consolidation of primary and all metastatic sites. The remaining 30 men had recurrent or metachronous OPC. Median and mean follow-up was 27 and 33 weeks, respectively. The majority of men (36/46 or 78%) had hormone sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) at the time of SABR with the remaining (10/46 or 22%) having castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Most men were treated with concurrent hormonal therapy (37/46 or 81%). In total consolidative SABR was delivered to 92 metastases: 71 bone (77%), 18 nodal (20%) and 3 (3%) visceral metastases. Overall LPFS at 1-year was 75% and 100% for SABR biologically effective doses >40. The bPFS and DPFS at 1-year were 72.7% and 73.5%, respectively. Crude Grade 1 and 2 acute toxicity were low at 30% and 5%, respectively, with no Grade 3 or higher acute toxicity. Conclusion(s): Consolidative SABR in men with OPC is feasible and well tolerated. The heterogeneity and small size of our series limits interpretation of clinically meaningful outcomes following consolidative SABR in OPC, but our preliminary data suggests this approach is worthy of further prospective study.

Some men with mCRPC may present at some point with oligometastases, a state between loco-regional and widespread metastatic disease with metastases being limited both in number and location. This oligometastatic state exists De novo, can be induced by effective systemic therapies, or may present under the picture of oligoprogression. The latter is a situation where >=3-5 metastatic tumor sites progress, while all other metastases are controlled by ongoing systemic therapy. The typical practice would be to change systemic therapy at this point. SABR is an emerging treatment option for oligometastatic or oligoprogressive malignancies. Used for this indication SABR may improve survival and delay the need to change systemic therapy. However, some patients may derive limited benefit only because of early and widespread metastatic progression following SABR. While there are no validated biomarkers to predict these two scenarios to date, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a minimally invasive and highly informative biomarker platform for identifying molecular changes associated with treatment outcome. Trial design: In the absence of published evidence on the use of SABR for oligoprogressive mCRPC in men undergoing abiraterone therapy, we are conducting a phase I study to determine the incidence of acute and late toxicities (primary endpoint) associated with delivering SABR to all oligoprogressive metastatic sites in 30 men with mCRPC on abiraterone. We also aim to collect preliminary efficacy data of such an approach as secondary endpoints (eg time to biochemical, radiological and/or symptomatic progression following SABR). Using conventional imaging, eligible mCRPC candidates will be identified based on<=5 SABR amenable progressive metastatic lesions (<=3 in any one organ system) while all other metastases remain stable or are responding to abiraterone therapy. Before SABR, we will collect ctDNA to perform gene copy number and mutational analyses of prostate cancer relevant genes as a means to predict sustained responses to SABR.",exclusion,Other study design (phase I),,PM199,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdx370.057,,,

Methods: Eligible patients had a controlled primary malignancy with 1‐5 metastatic lesions, all of which were suitable for SABR, had an ECOG performance status 0‐1, and life expectancy >6 months. Stratification was by number of metastases (1‐3 vs. 4‐5). Randomization was in a 1:2 ratio between palliative standard of care (SOC) [Arm 1] vs. SOC plus SABR to all metastatic lesions [Arm 2]. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). A randomized phase II screening design was employed with a two‐sided alpha of 0.20 (wherein a p‐value <0.20 designates a positive trial) to provide an initial comparison of the two treatment strategies. Secondary endpoints included progression‐free survival (PFS), toxicity, and QOL (assessed using the FACT‐G). Results: Between 2012‐2016, 99 patients were randomized (33 in Arm 1, 66 in Arm 2) at centres in Canada, Europe and Australia. Median age was 68 (range 43‐89) and the commonest primary tumor types were breast (n = 18), lung (n = 18), colorectal (n = 18) and prostate (n = 16). Most patients (n = 92) had 1‐3 metastases.

However, long-term randomized data that test this paradigm are lacking. METHODS: We enrolled patients with a controlled primary malignancy and 1-5 metastatic lesions, with all metastases amenable to stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). We stratified by the number of metastases (1-3 v 4-5) and randomized in a 1:2 ratio between palliative standard-of-care (SOC) treatments (arm 1) and SOC plus SABR (arm 2). We used a randomized phase II screening design with a primary end point of overall survival (OS), using an α of .20 (wherein P < .20 indicates a positive trial). Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity, and quality of life (QOL). Herein, we present long-term outcomes from the trial.

PSA3y was analyzed as a continuous variable. Toxicity was defined as the worst new toxicity and assessed using the radiation therapy oncology group (RTOG) late morbidity scheme. Univariate and multivariable regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between dose and PSA3y, and to explore predictors of late grade 2+ GU toxicity. Results Median PSA3y was 0.64 (intraquartile range (IQR): 0.41-1.12) and 0.27 (IQR: 0.12-0.55) ng/mL for patients treated with 35 and 40 Gy respectively.

Evidence from randomised controlled trials to support this paradigm is scarce. We aimed to assess the effect of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) on survival, oncological outcomes, toxicity, and quality of life in patients with a controlled primary tumour and one to five oligometastatic lesions. Method(s): This randomised, open-label phase 2 study was done at 10 hospitals in Canada, the Netherlands, Scotland, and Australia. Patients aged 18 or older with a controlled primary tumour and one to five metastatic lesions, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of 0-1, and a life expectancy of at least 6 months were eligible. After stratifying by the number of metastases (1-3 vs 4-5), we randomly assigned patients (1:2) to receive either palliative standard of care treatments alone (control group), or standard of care plus SABR to all metastatic lesions (SABR group), using a computer-generated randomisation list with permuted blocks of nine. Neither patients nor physicians were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival. We used a randomised phase 2 screening design with a two-sided alpha of 0.20 (wherein p<0.20 designates a positive trial). All analyses were intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01446744. Finding(s): 99 patients were randomised between Feb 10, 2012, and Aug 30, 2016. Of 99 patients, 33 (33%) were assigned to the control group and 66 (67%) to the SABR group. Two (3%) patients in the SABR group did not receive allocated treatment and withdrew from the trial; two (6%) patients in the control group also withdrew from the trial. Median follow-up was 25 months (IQR 19-54) in the control group versus 26 months (23-37) in the SABR group. Median overall survival was 28 months (95% CI 19-33) in the control group versus 41 months (26-not reached) in the SABR group (hazard ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.30-1.10; p=0.090). Adverse events of grade 2 or worse occurred in three (9%) of 33 controls and 19 (29%) of 66 patients in the SABR group (p=0.026), an absolute increase of 20% (95% CI 5-34). Treatment-related deaths occurred in three (4.5%) of 66 patients after SABR, compared with none in the control group. Interpretation(s): SABR was associated with an improvement in overall survival, meeting the primary endpoint of this trial, but three (4.5%) of 66 patients in the SABR group had treatment-related death.

Propensity score (PSM) was used to approximate the balance in covariates. Result(s): 209 patients were included, treated with MHRT (n=109) or SBRT (n=100). Median follow-up time was 37.4 months. Rates of BDFS at 1- and 3- years were 100% and 95%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups (p=0.868). Rates of OS at 1- and 3- years were 100% and 97.1%, respectively with no differences between the two groups (p=0.312). After PSM, no differences were observed in terms of acute and late RE and GI toxicity. While mild GU side effects were more common in SBRT group (45.5% vs. 19.5%), grade 2 and 3 toxicity were increased after MHRT (11.7% vs. 2.6%; p=0.029). Conclusion(s): Moderate hypofractionation and SBRT are two effective and safe options for the treatment of low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The analysis showed no difference in terms of disease's control and survival but increased moderate and severe toxicity after MHRT.",inclusion,,Confirmar si el comparador és adequat,,,exclusion,Congress abstract,

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of high-dose, non-invasive stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in a group of elderly patients affected by low and intermediate risk prostate cancer. Patients and Methods: Patients aged >=75 years, with biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were: initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <=20 ng/ml, Gleason Score <=7, International Prostate Symptom Score <=7. SBRT was performed with gantrybased volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in its RapidArc form and the use of flattening filter-free beams. The treatment schedule was 35 Gy in five fractions delivered on alternate days. Planning target volume included the prostate for low-risk and prostate plus seminal vesicles for intermediate risk, with a 5 mm margin of expansion in all directions. Toxicity was recorded according to CTCAE criteria v4.0. Biochemical failure was calculated according to the Phoenix definition. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaire was used to record health-related quality of life. Result(s): From May 2012 to April 2016, 50 patients were enrolled in the trial. Twenty-five patients were classified in low-risk group and 25 in intermediate-risk group. The mean age was 78 (range=75-84) years; Gleason score was 6 in 26 and 7 in 24 patients. Median initial PSA was 6.43 (range=2.6-17) ng/ml. Median follow-up was 26 months. Acute toxicity was mild. Rectal toxicity was reported as grade 1 in five (10%) cases and grade 2 in one (2%) cases; grade 1 and grade 2 genitourinary toxicity was described in 13 (26%) and 14 (28%) patients, respectively. In the late setting, three (6%) patients reported rectal grade 1 toxicity. Genitourinary late effects were reported as grade 1 in 13 (26%) patients and grade 2 in two (4%) patient. When evaluating outcome, median nadir PSA was 0.51 ng/ml (range=0.01-3.12) ng/ml. No biochemical relapses were observed during followup and all patients were alive at the time of the analysis. Conclusion(s): Gantry-based SBRT with VMAT and flattening filter-free can be considered an effective, non-invasive and safe approach for elderly patients affected by prostate cancer at low and intermediate risk. Randomized trials comparing SBRT with other approaches in this setting are necessary.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,,,,

Guidelines and payers variably support the use of prostate SBRT. We therefore sought to systematically analyze biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS), physician-reported toxicity, and patient-reported outcomes after prostate SBRT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A systematic search leveraging Medline via PubMed and EMBASE for original articles published between January 1990 and January 2018 was performed. This was supplemented by abstracts with sufficient extractable data from January 2013 to March 2018. All prospective series assessing curative-intent prostate SBRT for localized prostate cancer reporting bRFS, physician-reported toxicity, and patient-reported quality of life with a minimum of 1-year follow-up were included. The study was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Meta-analyses were performed with random-effect modeling. Extent of heterogeneity between studies was determined by the I(2) and Cochran's Q tests. Meta-regression was performed using Hartung-Knapp methods. RESULTS: Thirty-eight unique prospective series were identified comprising 6116 patients. Median follow-up was 39 months across all patients (range, 12-115 months). Ninety-two percent, 78%, and 38% of studies included low, intermediate, and high-risk patients. Overall, 5- and 7-year bRFS rates were 95.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 91.3%-97.5%) and 93.7% (95% CI, 91.4%-95.5%), respectively. Estimated late grade ≥3 genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity rates were 2.0% (95% CI, 1.4%-2.8%) and 1.1% (95% CI, 0.6%-2.0%), respectively. By 2 years post-SBRT, Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite urinary and bowel domain scores returned to baseline. Increasing dose of SBRT was associated with improved biochemical control (P = .018) but worse late grade ≥3 GU toxicity (P = .014). CONCLUSIONS: Prostate SBRT has substantial prospective evidence supporting its use, with favorable tumor control, patient-reported quality of life, and levels of toxicity demonstrated. SBRT has sufficient evidence to be supported as a standard treatment option for localized prostate cancer while ongoing trials assess its potential superiority.",exclusion,,"Dubte: revisió i metaanàlisi d'estudis prospectius, crec que no inclou RCTs.

random-journal.pdf,ProP261,"H., Wang",2016,English,pro.p:#5,Stereotactic body radiation therapy for primary prostate cancer with simultaneous integrated boost guided by 18F-choline PET/CT,"Purpose: Higher radiotherapy (RT) doses delivered to prostate cancer would result in a higher local control rate. However, as a dose limiting factor, proximity to organs-at-risk often precludes RT delivering the full prescription dose (PD) and/or escalating dose to the planning target volume (PTV) of prostate cancer, thus compromising the therapeutic ratio. In this study, we investigate the utility of 18F-choline positron emission tomography (PET) scans guidance for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) dose escalation to intraprostatic dominant lesion (IDL) (i.e., dose painting) in patients with prostate cancer and its impact on tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). Method(s): Twenty seven patients with localized prostate cancer who had 18F-choline PET/CT scan prior to treatment ere included. A pair of nested IDL contours (IDLsuv60% and IDLsuv70%) were generated for each patient based on 60% and 70% of maximum prostate uptake on the 18F-choline PET images. GTVreg was delineated on prostate according to the gland boundary seen on CT images. The PTVs (PTVsuv60% and PTVsuv70%) were defined as respective IDLs with a 3-mm margin posteriorly and 5 mm in all other dimensions. Two 5-fraction SBRT plans using Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) technique along with 10 MV Flattening Filter Free (FFF) beams, plan36Gy and plan50-55Gy, were generated for each patient. All plans included a dose of 36.25 Gy prescribed to PTVreg. The Plan50-55Gy also included a simultaneous boost dose of 50 Gy and 55 Gy prescribed to the PTVsuv60% and PTV suv70%, respectively. The utility of 18F-Choline PET-guided SBRT dose escalation was evaluated by its ability to achieve the prescription dose objectives while adhering to organ-at-risk (OAR) dose constraints. The TCP and NTCP calculated by radiological models were also compared between two plans for each patient. Result(s): In all 54 SBRT plans generated, the planning objectives and dose constraints were met without exception. Plan50-55Gy had a significantly higher dose in PTVsuv60% and PTVsuv70% than those in Plan36Gy (p < 0.05), respectively, while still maintaining a safe OAR sparing profile. In addition, plan50-55Gy had significantly higher TCP than plan36Gy. Conclusion(s): Using VMAT with FFF beams to incorporate a simultaneous 18F-choline PET-guided radiation boost dose up to 55 Gy into a SBRT plan is technically feasible. The relationship between local control and normal tissue toxicity in SBRT dose painting should be validated in clinical trials.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11307-016-1031-0,,,

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a PRISMA-guided systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective prostate SBRT trials. Results: Fourteen trials with a total of 2,038 patients were included. Median follow-up was 37 months (range 6-55 months). Most patients had cT1-T2a, Gleason ≤7 disease with median pre-treatment PSAs of 5-10; 1,042 (51%) were low-risk, 744 (37%) were intermediate-risk, 158 (8%) were high-risk, and the remainder were unreported. Doses ranged from 33.5-50.0 Gy, most typically in 5 fractions, with nearly all studies delivering nondaily fractionation with some type of daily image guidance. Outcomes were converted into counts at the end of one year. The pooled rate of FFBF was 98% [95% confidence interval, 97-98%]. The pooled rate of late grade ≥3 gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities were 1% [0-5%] and 2% [1-3%], respectively. Methods: PubMed and Google Scholar were queried for prospective studies evaluating survival and/or toxicity outcomes in SBRT (≤5 fractions) for localized prostate cancer. Pooled rates of freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) and late grades ≥3 gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicities were assessed. Meta-analysis of proportions was logit transformed and pooled using generalized linear mixed models (both fixed and random effects) and subsequently back transformed to standard proportions. Conclusions: Despite the lack of long-term follow-up and heterogeneity of the available evidence, prostate SBRT affords appropriate biochemical control with few high-grade toxicities. These data have implications for ongoing worldwide utilization of prostate SBRT as well as ongoing prospective investigations.",exclusion,,"Dubte: revisió i metaanàlisi d'estudis prospectius, crec que no inclou RCTs.

Consensus regarding the appropriate patient-reported outcome (PRO) endpoints for clinical trials evaluating radiation modalities for early stage prostate cancer is lacking. To aid in clinical trial design, this study presents PROs over a 36-month period following SBRT for clinically localized prostate cancer. METHODS: Between February 2008 and September 2010, 174 hormone-naïve patients with clinically localized prostate cancer were treated with 35-36.25 Gy SBRT (CyberKnife, Accuray) delivered in 5 fractions. Patients completed the validated Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)-26 questionnaire at baseline and all follow-ups. The proportion of patients developing a clinically significant decline in each EPIC domain score was determined. The minimally important difference (MID) was defined as a change of one-half the standard deviation from the baseline. Per Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0938, we also examined the patients who experienced a decline in EPIC urinary domain summary score of >2 points (unacceptable toxicity defined as ≥60% of all patients reporting this degree of decline) and EPIC bowel domain summary score of >5 points (unacceptable toxicity defined as >55% of all patients reporting this degree of decline) from baseline to 1 year. RESULTS: A total of 174 patients at a median age of 69 years received SBRT with a minimum follow-up of 36 months. The proportion of patients reporting a clinically significant decline (MID for urinary/bowel are 5.5/4.4) in EPIC urinary/bowel domain scores was 34%/30% at 6 months, 40%/32.2% at 12 months, and 32.8%/21.5% at 36 months. The patients reporting a decrease in the EPIC urinary domain summary score of >2 points was 43.2% (CI: 33.7%, 54.6%) at 6 months, 51.6% (CI: 43.4%, 59.7%) at 12 months, and 41.8% (CI: 33.3%, 50.6%) at 36 months. The patients reporting a decrease in the EPIC bowel domain summary score of >5 points was 29.6% (CI: 21.9%, 39.3%) at 6 months, 29% (CI: 22%, 36.8%) at 12 months, and 22.4% (CI: 15.7%, 30.4%) at 36 months. CONCLUSION: Following prostate SBRT, clinically significant urinary symptoms are more common than bowel symptoms. Our prostate SBRT treatment protocol meets the RTOG 0938 criteria for moving forward to a Phase III trial comparing it to conventionally fractionated radiation therapy. Notably, between 12 and 36 months, the proportion of patients reporting a significant decrease in both EPIC urinary and bowel domain scores declined, suggesting a late improvement in these symptom domains. Further investigation is needed to elucidate (1) which EPIC domains bear the greatest influence on post-treatment quality of life and (2) at what time point PRO endpoint(s) should be assessed.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,10.3389/fonc.2015.00077,,,

While no randomized trials have compared the efficacy of SBRT to conventionally fractionated radiation therapy (CFRT), numerous prospective trials and retrospective reviews have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of SBRT for localized prostate cancer, used either definitively or as a boost along with CFRT.

A fused magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) planning scan has been mandated in PACE, but this may limit recruitment at centers where it is not routine. Studies have suggested computed tomography (CT)-only volumes may increase dose to the rectum. We aimed to determine whether CT-only volumes would be similar enough to MRI-fusion volumes to produce acceptable PACE SBRT plans. Materials/Methods: CT data sets from 20 patients previously treated according to the PACE trial protocol were used. These patients had fused MRI-aided contouring (MR). Treatment was 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions to the planning target volume (PTV) (with prostate itself receiving 40 Gy in 5 fractions). Patients were anonymously recontoured on CT only (with no reference to MRI data) on 2 separate occasions, 2 months apart (CT1 and CT2). Contouring was done as a consensus volume of 2 observers experienced in both CT-only and MR-fusion contouring. These patients were then replanned by an independent planner with CTonly volumes and no reference to the original plan. Contouring and planning was done as per PACE protocol, using a robotic radiosurgery inverse planning system. Dice coefficient was used to assess volume concordance. Result(s): Mean prostate and base of seminal vesicle volumes were 63.5 mL (range 23-144), 63.2 (range 33-143), and 63.8 (range 32-142) for MR, CT1, and CT2, respectively. Mean Dice coefficient was 0.86 (CI 0.84- 0.87), 0.85 (0.83-0.86), 0.92 (0.91-0.93) for MRvCT1, MRvCT2, and CT1vCT2, respectively. The apex was on average contoured 1.1 mm lower on MR than with CT (SD 3.5 mm). Eighteen of the MR-contoured plans met all PACE dose constraints, versus 19 of the CT-contoured plans. Median rectal V18.1Gy, V29Gy and V36Gy and bladder V18.1Gy, V37Gy were not significantly different between MR- or CT-contoured plans (Wilcoxon signed ranks test). Conclusion(s): CT-only contouring produces similar volumes to fused MRI contours and no dosimetric disadvantage. While we would still strongly recommend MRI-fusion contouring for its superior anatomical fidelity, the PACE protocol has been modified such that this is no longer mandated.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,"Buscar RCT:  The PACE trial randomizes between stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and either prostatectomy or conventionally fractionated radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer (NCT01584258; UKCRN12628) (CM 05-01-2021 done, no extra info)",,,,,

Methods and Materials: Patients with organ-confined, node-negative prostate cancer who had biochemical failure (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] less than 2.0) after prostatectomy were eligible for this phase 1 dose-escalation trial. Doses delivered were 35 Gy, 40 Gy, and 45 Gy in 5 fractions, given every other day. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0) grade 3 or higher gastrointestinal or genitourinary (GU) toxicity within 90 days of treatment. Maximum tolerated dose was the highest dose to be tested where fewer than 2 of the patients experienced DLT. Patients completed quality-of-life questionnaires at regular time intervals. Result(s): Twenty-six patients completed treatment between October 2013 and December 2017. Three patients received 35 Gy, 8 patients received 40 Gy, and 15 patients received 45 Gy. The median follow-up was 60 months for 35 Gy, 48 months for 40 Gy, and 33 months for 45 Gy. No acute DLT events were observed. Late grade >=2 and >=3 gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in 11% and 0%, respectively, and late grade >=2 and >=3 GU toxicity occurred in 38% and 15%, respectively. No difference was observed in late GU toxicity between 40 Gy and 45 Gy. Sexual function scores were significantly lower in the patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy (P < .01). In all patients, the crude rate of PSA control (<0.2 ng/mL) was 11 out of 26 (42%). Conclusion(s): Dose escalation to 45 Gy did not result in acute DLT events, had similar rates of late grade 3 toxicity, and did not demonstrate higher rates of PSA control, compared with 40 Gy. While allowing for higher plan heterogeneity, the recommended dose for phase 2 study will be 40 Gy in 5 fractions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",exclusion,Other study design (phase I),,,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.11.005,,,

The primacy outcome measure was efficacy, defined by 5-year disease free survival (DFS), based on the ""prostate specific antigen nadir + 2 ng/mL"" definition. The secondary outcome measure was safety, defined as incidence of grade >=2 late genitourinary (GU) or gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events or Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. Materials/Methods: PICOS/PRISMA/MOOSE methods were used to identify eligible studies. Inclusion criteria were: (1) patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer; (2) HIMRT, >2 (<5) Gy/fraction; or SBRT, >= 5 Gy/fraction in <= 5 fractions; (3) either no control group, or another definitive RT control arm; (4) at least one of the primary or secondary outcome measures were reported; (5) single or multi arm phase III (HIMRT) and/or phase I-II (SBRT) prospective study. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was prescribed per protocol specifications. Weighted random effects meta-analyses using the DerSimonian and Laird method were conducted to characterize summary effect sizes for each outcome. Meta-regression and Wald-type tests were used to compare each outcome by treatment, where the null hypothesis was rejected for p<0.05. Result(s): After initial screening of 130 studies, 24 prospective trials containing 6,952 patients (3,027 SBRT [57% low-risk, 37% intermediate, 6% high] and 3,925 HIMRT [25% low, 60% intermediate, 15% high]) from 3 countries were included. ADT use was assessed (12% SBRT and 61% HIMRT). The median follow-up was 5.8 years for SBRT vs. 5.2 years for HIMRT. Prescription doses for SBRT ranged from 19-38 Gy in 2-4 fractions to 50 Gy in 5 fractions, and those of HIMRT ranged from 51.6 Gy in 12 fractions to 70.2 Gy in 26 fractions. The 5-year DFS rates for SBRT ranged from 81%-100% vs. 79%-91% for HIMRT. The random effects estimate for 5-year DFS was 95.3% (95% confidence Interval [CI]: 92.1%-97.8%) for SBRT vs. 85.7% (95% CI: 82.7%-88.5%) for HIMRT (p=0.0004). Rates of late grade 2+ GU toxicity for SBRT ranged from 0%-32.1% vs. 6.1%-49.3% for HIMRT. The random effects estimate for late grade 2+ GU toxicity was 14.4% (95% CI: 10.9%-18.3%) for SBRT vs. 20.9% (95% CI: 9.8%-34.7%) for HIMRT (p=0.27). Rates of late grade 2+ GI toxicity ranged from 0%-29% for SBRT vs. 7.4%-25.6% for HIMRT. The random effects estimate for late grade 2+ GI toxicity was 2.7% (95% CI: 1%-4.9%) for SBRT vs. 14.7% (95% CI: 9.4%-20.9%) for HIMRT (p<0.0001). Conclusion(s): In this select patient population with prospectively collected outcomes, SBRT had superior biochemical control with fewer long-term GU and GI toxicity rates over HIMRT in the treatment of localized prostate cancer.

However, the NCCN permits selective use of SBRT with ADT for unfavorable intermediate (UIR) and high (HiR) risk PC in cases where conventional/moderately fractionated radiation therapy (EBRT) present medical or social hardship. How SBRT+ADT compares to EBRT+ADT in UIR and HiR men is unknown. Method(s): Men >40 years old with localized PC treated with RT and concomitant ADT for curative intent between 2004-2015 were analyzed from the National Cancer Database. Patients treated with brachytherapy or who lacked ADT or risk stratification data were excluded. A total of 558 men treated with SBRT (5 fractions, >7 Gy/fraction) versus 40,797 men treated with moderate or conventional EBRT (dose >60 Gy with <3 Gy/fraction) were included. Patients were stratified by UIR and HiR using NCCN criteria. Kaplan Meier and Cox proportional hazards were used to compare overall survival (OS) between RT modality, adjusting for age, race, and comorbidity index. Result(s): With a median follow up of 62 months, there was no difference in 5-year OS between men treated with SBRT versus EBRT regardless of risk group (UIR: 87.2% SBRT versus 87.0% EBRT, p=.40; HiR: 80.4% SBRT versus 80.8% EBRT, p=.21). On multivariable analysis, there was no difference in risk of death for men treated with SBRT compared to EBRT (UIR: adjusted HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.68-1.74, p=.72; HiR: adjusted HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.76-1.14, p=.51 ). Conclusion(s): We found no difference in survival between SBRT+ADT and standard of care EBRT+ADT for UIR or HiR PC. Randomized trials of SBRT versus EBRT, with standard concomitant ADT, in these risks groups are needed.

It was hypothesized that HDR brachytherapy-level doses of 10-15 Gy can be safely delivered using SBRT. Purpose/Objective(s): From 2011 to 2013, 30 patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer were enrolled, with 10 patients in each of 3 sequential SBRT boost dose cohorts (10 Gy, 12.5 Gy, and 15 Gy). SBRT single fraction was delivered with a rectal balloon and Foley catheter. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to aid in contouring and determination of patient specific planning target volumes. All patients received intensity modulated radiotherapy (37.5 Gy in 15 fractions) afterwards. Acute/late toxicities (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0) and health-related quality of life (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite [EPIC]) were collected prospectively. The minimally clinically important change (MCIC) was defined as EPIC score decrease (baseline score-average follow-up score) > 0.5 SD, where SD is the standard deviation of baseline scores for each domain. Result(s): Median age was 71 years. Prostate volumes ranged from 24-48 cc. Mean baseline PSA was 10.2 ng/mL. Median follow-up was 51 months. There was no significant difference among the 3 cohorts except for baseline PSA (15 Gy cohort had higher PSA values), and duration of follow-up (follow-up was longest in the 10 Gy cohort given sequential nature of study). Acute toxicity was mild, with only 30% of all patients experiencing grade 2 GU toxicity and 0% grade 2 GI toxicity. Any late grade >= 2 GU toxicity occurred in 40% of patients, while any late grade >= 2 GI toxicity occurred in 30% of patients. One patient developed a rectal-urethral fistula after multiple biopsies of a rectal ulcer. There was no significant difference in the proportion of any late grade >=2 GU or GI toxicity among the 3 cohorts. The mean EPIC scores did not significantly change during the follow-up period in all domains among all patients. MCIC occurred in 27.6%, 37.9%, and 42.3%, respectively, in the urinary, bowel, and sexual domains. There were no significant differences in the proportion of MCIC among the 3 cohorts, except for the sexual domain. Patients in the 15 Gy cohort had a higher proportion of sexual MCIC. (P = 0.0386). There was only one patient who failed biochemically according to Phoenix definition. Patients in the 10 Gy cohort had significantly higher post treatment PSA levels over time compared to the other 2 cohorts (P < 0.002). Conclusion(s): Single fraction SBRT boost was well tolerated. Fifteen Gy arm patients had worse sexual function afterwards but lower post treatment PSA values compared to the 10 Gy arm. Such an approach is worthy of further investigation and may represent an alternative to brachytherapy boost.",exclusion,Other study design (phase I),,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.06.515,,,

The primary aim of this study was to report progression-free survival (PFS) data for patients with bone-only disease. Influence of hormone sensitivity and androgen deprivation therapy use was also assessed. METHODS: This is a single-centre retrospective cohort study. Hormone-sensitive and castrate-resistant patients with oligometastatic (≤ 3) bone-only prostate cancer treated with SBRT were included. Data were collected using electronic records. Kaplan-Meier survivor function, log rank test, as well as Cox regression were used to calculate PFS and overall survival. RESULTS: In total, 51 patients with 64 bone metastases treated with SBRT were included. Nine patients were castrate resistant and 42 patient's hormone sensitive at the time of SBRT. Median follow-up was 23 months. Median PFS was 24 months in hormone-sensitive patients and 3 months in castrate-resistant patients. No patients experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicities. There were three in-field recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, patients with bone oligometastatic disease showed potential benefit from SBRT with a median PFS of 11 months. Hormone-sensitive patients showed the greatest benefit, with results similar to that published for oligometastatic pelvic nodal disease treated with SBRT. Prospective randomised control trials are needed to determine the survival benefit of SBRT in oligometastatic bone-only prostate cancer and to determine prognostic indicators.",exclusion,Other tumor treated (skeletal),,PM213,10.1007/s00345-019-02873-w,,,

Herein we present the preliminary toxicity results of a phase II trial evaluating a five fraction SBRT regimen for high-risk CaP that allows for the integration pelvic nodal radiation (RT) and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Purpose/Objective(s): Men with high-risk CaP, as defined by Gleason score >= 8, clinical stage T3-T4, or initial PSA >= 20 ng/mL, were enrolled on a multicenter phase II trial and were treated with 40 Gy to prostate. Radiation to the pelvic nodes with 25 Gy in a simultaneous integrated boost plan (5 Gy per fraction) and/or a nine months neoadjuvant and concurrent androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) could be integrated with prostate SBRT at the discretion of the treating physician. Follow-up assessment was with CTCAE v4 and Expanded Prostate Composite Index (EPIC). SBRT was delivered with a linear accelerator using volumetric modulated arc therapy or with a CyberKnife system. Result(s): A total of 73 patients have been treated on this protocol, with a median follow-up of 13.8 months. Forty-six (63%) received ADT and 23 (32%) received nodal RT. The median initial PSA was 8.8 ng/mL and 11% of patients had clinical T3-T4 disease; 48% and 33% had Gleason score 8 and 9-10 disease, respectively. No grade 3 or higher genitourinary (GU) or gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities were seen. For patients receiving nodal radiation, rates of acute grade 1 and 2 GU toxicities were 18.2% and 4.5%; for those not receiving nodal RT, they were 23.5% and 17.6%. Rates of acute grade 1 and 2 GI toxicities were 9.1% and 9.1% with and 11.8% and 3.9% without nodal RT. Late grade 1 and 2 GU toxicities rates with nodal RT were 27.3% and 4.5%; without nodal RT, the rates were 18.6% and 7.0%. Late grade 1 and 2 GI rates were 13.6% and 13.6% with nodal radiation and 11.6% and 4.7% without it. Mean changes in EPIC urinary and bowel domain scores at 4 months were +0.13 and-4.17 with nodal RT, and +0.79 and-2.97 without it.

These patients are usually treated in the same way as those with distant metastases by means of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT). We want to report the outcome of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) for oligorecurrent nodal PCa. MATERIAL & METHODS: This was a retrospective multicentre analysis of patients diagnosed with 3 metachronous nodal recurrences treated with SBRT. SBRT was defined as a radiotherapy dose of at least 5 Gy per fraction to a Biological Effective Dose (BED) of at least 80 Gy to all metastatic sites. The study was approved by the central ethics committee (EC2014/ 0199). Inclusion criteria were as follows: histologically proven diagnosis of PCa, biochemical relapse of PCa after radical local prostate treatment and the detection of up to three N1 or M1a lesions. Patients were excluded in the case of M1b or M1c lesions, serum testosterone levels 12 months with SBRT, previous pelvic radiotherapy, biochemical relapse while on active treatment with a systmemic agent for PCa. The primary endpoint was Distant Progression-Free Survival (DPFS), defined as the time interval between the first day of SBRT and appearance of new metastatic lesions, outside the high-dose region. Secondary endpoints were local control, time to start of palliative ADT and toxicity scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0. RESULT(S): Overall, 171 metastases were detected (84% with choline PET-CT) and treated with SBRT in 134 patients. The median follow-up from SBRT was 29 mo (IQR: 13-47). Adjuvant ADT was given in 33% of patients for a median duration of 6 mo (IQR: 1-8 mo). The median DPFS was 21 mo (95% CI: 18-24 mo) with 80% of patients having <=3 metastases at time of progression. The 3-year local progression rate was 41% for patients treated with a BED 100Gy (p<0.001). The median time from first SBRT to the start of palliative ADT was 25 mo (95% CI: 18 - 32). Late grade I and II toxicity was observed in 10% (N=13) and 4% of patients (N=6). No grade 3 toxicity was observed. ZCONCLUSIONS: SBRT for oligometastatic PCa nodal recurrence is safe. The majority of subsequent relapses remain nodal and oligometastatic.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,PM215,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) provides a potential for cure in a selected group of patients with oligometastatic PCa in the PSMA-PET era. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a prospective, single-centre study of patients with oligometastatic PCa undergoing SBRT from November 2014 to July 2016. We included patients with relapsed PCa receiving SBRT with PSMA-PET-confirmed oligometastases (n=1-3) confined to lymph nodes (LNs) or bone without androgen deprivation therapy. SBRT schedules included 20Gy/1# or 24Gy/2# to bone metastases, and 50Gy/5# or 30Gy/3# to LNs. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint was biochemical failure (BF) defined as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of nadir + 0.2 ng/ml following SBRT. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Fifty-seven patients were eligible, of whom 50 (88%) had undergone radical prostatectomy. The median time from definitive treatment to SBRT was 5.6 yr. A total of 73 lesions were treated: 44 patients had one metastasis, while 13 had two or three. Thirty-seven patients (65%) had LN-only disease, while 18 (31%) had bone-only metastasis. Median follow up was 16 mo. The median biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) for the cohort was 11 mo, with 31.9% bDFS at 15 mo. All patients with BF (n=43) underwent a repeat PSMA-PET scan, which revealed no in-field failures. Median bDFS was not affected by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at diagnosis, Gleason score, time from diagnosis to SBRT, site (bone vs LN), PSA doubling time before SBRT, or number of metastases. Failures were somewhat less common in patients with low PSA before SBRT. Toxicity was rare: no patients developed grade ≥2 late toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: SBRT delivered very high rates of local control with minimal toxicity. However, distant recurrences occurred in most patients by 15 mo and did not appear to be predicted by known prognostic factors. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report, we looked at outcomes after the use of stereotactic body radiotherapy for patients with prostate cancer spread to one to three lymph nodes or bones as detected by positron emission tomography scans. We demonstrated high rates of control of the treated lesions with low toxicity, but by 15 mo more than two-thirds of patients had developed recurrent cancer outside the treated area.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,PM216,10.1016/j.euo.2018.04.017,,,

Material and Methods In this retrospective study, we analyzed castrate and noncastrate patients treated by SBRT between November 2011 and April 2016 for 1 to 3 metastases, bone or node, diagnosed on a positron emission tomography - computed tomography (PET-CT) or on a bone-scintigraphy with technetium-99, following biochemical recurrence of a prostate cancer after a local curative treatment. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was the primary end-point defined as the time interval between the first day of SBRT and biochemical failure, defined as 2 consecutive elevations of PSA with last dosage superior to PSA dosage before treatment, or clinical failure, defined as new metastases found on an imaging check-up (PET-CT or scintigraphy). PSA dosage before SBRT, type of metastase (bone or node), number of lesions treated in SBRT, patient's ages, nadir of PSA after SBRT, and concomittant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were analyzed in univariate and multivariate logistic regression to identify pronostic factors of poor response to SBRT. Results With a median follow-up from time of SBRT of 12 months, we treated 40 patients and 56 metastatic lesions, with a local-control rate of 85%. 19 patients were treated for 1 to 3 bone lesions and 21 patients for 1 to 3 node lesions. 8 patients with bone oligo-metastasis and 13 patients with node oligometastasis had a recurrence. The primary involved metastatic sites were G279 nodes ( 52 %) and bone ( 52 %), with 3 patients having both node and bone recurrence . A 2nd and 3rd course of radiotherapy was delivered in 8 and 1 patients respectively. Median RFS was 345 days (134 ; 426) in the node metastatic group and 494 days (85 ; 877) in the bone metastatic group. On bivariate analysis, a PSA nadir up to 0,51 ng/mL after SBRT was identified as a pronostic factor of low RFS. This result was not confirmed in multivariate analysis. There might be a significative difference in RFS between node group and bone group. Conclusion There might appear that patients treated by SBRT for node oligometastatic prostate cancer recurrence after a local curative treatment could have a lower recurrencefree survival than patient treated for bone oligometastatic disease in the same conditions.

random-journal.pdf,ProP280,"Kothari, G",2018,English,pro.p:#5,Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Primary Prostate Cancer,"Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous cancer in males. There are a number of options for patients with localized early stage disease, including active surveillance for low-risk disease, surgery, brachytherapy, and external beam radiotherapy. Increasingly, external beam radiotherapy, in the form of dose-escalated and moderately hypofractionated regimens, is being utilized in prostate cancer, with randomized evidence to support their use. Stereotactic body radiotherapy, which is a form of extreme hypofractionation, delivered with high precision and conformality typically over 1 to 5 fractions, offers a more contemporary approach with several advantages including being non-invasive, cost-effective, convenient for patients, and potentially improving patient access. In fact, one study has estimated that if half of the patients currently eligible for conventional fractionated radiotherapy in the United States were treated instead with stereotactic body radiotherapy, this would result in a total cost savings of US$250 million per year. There is also a strong radiobiological rationale to support its use, with prostate cancer believed to have a low alpha/beta ratio and therefore being preferentially sensitive to larger fraction sizes. To date, there are no published randomized trials reporting on the comparative efficacy of stereotactic body radiotherapy compared to alternative treatment modalities, although multiple randomized trials are currently accruing. Yet, early results from the randomized phase III study of HYPOfractionated RadioTherapy of intermediate risk localized Prostate Cancer (HYPO-RT-PC) trial, as well as multiple single-arm phase I/II trials, indicate low rates of late adverse effects with this approach. In patients with low-to intermediate-risk disease, excellent biochemical relapse-free survival outcomes have been reported, albeit with relatively short median follow-up times. These promising early results, coupled with the enormous potential cost savings and implications for resource availability, suggest that stereotactic body radiotherapy will take center stage in the treatment of prostate cancer in the years to come.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.",exclusion,,Llegir per a informació general i referències sobre RCTs,,10.1177/1533033818789633,,,

Material(s) and Method(s): Between September 2008 and December 2014, 40 prostate cancer pts with 47 recurrent isolated LNM, were treated with SBRT. Median age was 74 yrs (range, 58-83), median Gleason score at the primary diagnosis was 7 (range, 5-10). Median and mean time from primary treatment to SBRT were 37.45 and 62.6 m, respectively (range 11.16-216.03). Diagnosis was performed with choline (ch) PET/CT, and the mean and median PSA values before SBRT were 5.6 and 4.2 ng/ml, respectively. Six (15%) pts were treated in different sessions for metachronous metastases, and one (2%) underwent SBRT for two synchronous metastases. 21 (52.5%) pts underwent only SBRT, remaining 19 (47.5%) received also androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated using choline uptake and planning target volume (PTV) was defined as the GTV plus a 5-8 mm isotropic margin. Mean and median volume of GTV and PTV were 6.63 cc and 3 cc and 25.03 and 15.03 cc, respectively. In 90% of cases 5 fractions of 6-8 Gy were delivered. Response was assessed with PSA evaluation scheduled every 3 m during the first year and then every 6 m. Pts with a reduction or a stability of PSA level were considered responders. Being evaluation of response with ch-PET-CT not mandatory, it was done in 23 (57.5%) pts. Result(s): Mean and median follow-up were 30.18 and 23.8 m, respectively (range 3.73-79.8). Mean time of biochemical progression from the end of SBRT was 15.54 m (range 1.16 - 48.86), and the 2-years biochemical progression free survival (b-PFS) was 44%. We registered a complete concordance between PSA increase and progression of disease shown at ch-PET/CT. Sixteen (40%) of the pts experienced no disease recurrence after SBRT. Of 21 no-ADT pts, 16 (76%) were still free from ADT (mean 26.18 m), whereas remaining 5 (24%) had a mean deferment time of ADT of 13.58 m. At univariate analysis, Gleason score >7 is related with a worse b-PFS (p=0.02). Acute grade 2 diarrhea was registered in 1 (2,5%) case. Grade 3 small bowel late toxicity was observed in only one (2.5%) case 11.76 m after the end of SBRT. Conclusion(s): SBRT resulted effective and generally well tolerated by pts.

However, few have reported outcomes for prostate SBRT using periprostatic hydrogel spacer (SpaceOAR; Augmenix). Herein, we report safety and efficacy outcomes from our institutional prostate SBRT experience with SpaceOAR placement. METHODS: Fifty men with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated at a single institution with linear accelerator-based SBRT to 3625 cGy in 5 fractions, with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were included. All patients underwent SpaceOAR and fiducial marker placement followed by pre-treatment MRI. Toxicity assessments were conducted at least weekly while on treatment, 1 month after treatment, and every follow-up visit thereafter. Post-treatment PSA measurements were obtained 4 months after SBRT, followed by every 3-6 months thereafter. Acute toxicity was documented per RTOG criteria. RESULTS: Median follow up time was 20 (range 4-44) months. Median PSA at time of diagnosis was 7.4 (2.7-19.5) ng/ml. Eighteen men received 6 months of ADT for unfavorable intermediate risk disease. No PSA failures were recorded. Median PSA was 0.9 ng/mL at 20 months; 0.08 and 1.32 ng/mL in men who did and did not receive ADT, respectively. Mean prostate-rectum separation achieved with SpaceOAR was 9.6 ± 4 mm at the prostate midgland. No grade ≥ 3 GU or GI toxicity was recorded. During treatment, 30% of men developed new grade 2 GU toxicity (urgency or dysuria). These symptoms were present in 30% of men at 1 month and in 12% of men at 1 year post-treatment. During treatment, GI toxicity was limited to grade 1 symptoms (16%), although 4% of men developed grade 2 symptoms during the first 4 weeks after SBRT. All GI symptoms were resolving by the 1 month post-treatment assessment and no acute or late rectal toxicity was reported > 1 month after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Periprostatic hydrogel placement followed by prostate SBRT resulted in minimal GI toxicity, and favorable early oncologic outcomes. These results indicate that SBRT with periprostatic spacer is a well-tolerated, safe, and convenient treatment option for localized prostate cancer.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,10.1186/s13014-019-1346-5,,,

Re-irradiation schedules have been explored in different tumour sites. In this report, we present our preliminary experience of re-irradiation using stereotactic body radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer failure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between March 2011 and October 2014, robotic stereotactic body radiation therapy was administered to patients previously treated with external-beam radiation therapy to a median dose of 71.1Gy (range, 45-76.5Gy) and with biochemical failure corresponding to a local in-field recurrence of prostate cancer. Ten patients had recurrences after postoperative external-beam radiotherapy. Patients underwent a pelvic MRI to confirm the recurrence and a total body staging using a ((18)F)-fluorocholine PET/CT. The prescription dose consisted of five fractions of 7.25Gy to a total dose of 36.25Gy. Efficacy was evaluated based on biochemical response and toxicity was evaluated according to CTCAE v.4.0 questionnaires and International Prostate Symptom Score. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were treated and followed for a median time of 11.7 months (mean: 13.4 months; range: 2.5-46.5 months). Median time between the first external-beam radiation therapy of prostate cancer and the first day of CyberKnife(®) treatment was 111 months (range: 38-398 months). One-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rate was 83.3%, and only one in-field progression was reported. Two patients had a biochemical failure corresponding to metastatic progression without evidence of local recurrence. Treatment was well tolerated, with only one grade 2 acute genitourinary toxicity, no grade≥2 acute gastrointestinal or late toxicities were reported. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic body re-irradiation therapy using CyberKnife(®) after failed external-beam radiation therapy showed favourable results in terms of in-field local and biochemical control. Toxicity was low and acceptable. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these results to select patient and to evaluate the introduction of androgen-deprivation therapy.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,PM223,10.1016/j.canrad.2016.03.005,,,

However, late toxicity remains a point of concern. SMART is a novel approach using: 1) MRI-based setup 2) smaller CTV-PTV margins, enabled by gated delivery under real-time MRI-guidance and 3) daily treatment plan re-optimization. Since May 2016, SMART was applied in patients with localized PC in the setting of a prospective phase II study with toxicity as primary endpoint. We report on an interim analysis of the benefit of daily re-optimization (not subject of the trial) in the first 80 fractions in 16 treated patients. Purpose/Objective(s): SMART is delivered in 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy to the prostate with or without the base of the vesicles, with simultaneous integrated urethra-sparing to 32.5 Gy in 5 fractions. Static field IMRT plans ensure steep dose gradients at the border between the PTV with rectum and bladder. Prior to each fraction, a high resolution 0.35T MRI is performed, and after alignment and eventual adjustment of the CTV, a PTV is created by adding a 3 mm margin. After propagation, deformation and manual adjustment of the OARs (rectum, bladder) located within 3 cm of the PTV, re-optimization of the original plan is executed using the same number and direction of IMRT beams, resulting in a ""plan of the day"". Patient-specific QA is performed using independent Monte Carlo dose calculation. Gated SMART delivery is performed under MRI-guidance, using the PTV as safety boundary. In order to establish the benefit of daily plan re-optimization, predicted plans (defined as projection of the baseline plan on the ""anatomy of the day"") were compared to re-optimized plans for each fraction. Inadequate plans were defined as 1) CTV coverage <=90% of the prescription dose, and/or 20 exceeding the preset institutional high-dose constraints for the rectum (V90% <=10cc) or bladder (V90% <=15cc). Result(s): In 7/80 fractions, the CTV was manually edited due to pitch or roll, which obviously mandated re-optimization, and these were excluded from the analysis. Predicted plans revealed that the high-dose constraints for the rectum and bladder were not met in 7/73 (10%) and 6/73 (8%) of fractions, respectively in 8 different patients. CTV coverage was less than 90% in 16/73 (22%) fractions. Overall, predicted plans were inadequate in 26/73 fractions (36%). Re-optimization improved all 26 plans, correcting CTV coverage to >95% and reducing rectal high-dose for all fractions, however, the high-dose bladder constraint remained marginally exceeded in 3 fractions (V90% 15.2-15.8cc). Conclusion(s): Daily re-optimization is mandatory to ensure appropriate target coverage when performing prostate SBRT with 3mm CTV to PTV margins, even with ideal pre-treatment setup. In addition, re-optimization improves the sparing of the rectum and bladder from high-doses in approximately 20% of fractions.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.06.2246,,,

Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an emerging treatment for prostate cancer but its use in high risk disease is limited. We compare efficacy, survival and late toxicity outcomes in patients treated on 2 prospective, phase 2 protocols that both use pelvic SBRT and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). One used MR-guided HDR brachytherapy boost (SPARE) and the other uses a SBRT boost (SATURN). Method(s): SPARE was a phase I/II study where intermediate (IR) or high-risk (HR) prostate cancer patients received HDR-BT 15Gy x 1 to the prostate and up to 22.5Gy to the MRI nodule and followed by gantry-based SBRT 25Gy in 5 weekly fractions delivered to pelvis. ADT was used for 6-18 months. SATURN was a phase II study where high risk patients received 40Gy to prostate and 25Gy to pelvis along in 5 weekly fractions with 12-18 months ADT. CTCAEv3 was used to assess toxicities and was captured q6months x 5 years. Biochemical failure (BF; nadir + 2 definition), nadir PSA, proportion of patients with PSA < 0.4 ng/ml at 4 years (4yPSARR), incidence of salvage therapy, cause specific survival were calculated. Day 0 was first day of RT for all time-to-event analyses. Result(s): Thirty-two patients (NCCN 3% favorable IR, 47% unfavorable IR (UIR), 50% HR) completed SPARE while 30 patients (7% UIR, 93% HR) completed SATURN. Median follow-up of 50 and 48 months, respectively. Actuarial 4-year BF was 11.5% and 0%. Median nPSA was 0.02 ng/ml for both studies. 4yPSARR was 69% and 93%. 4-year cause-specific survival was 96% and 100%. Toxicities are listed in Table. Conclusion(s): In the context of SBRT pelvis and ADT, SBRT boost provides similar efficacy for unfavorable risk prostate cancer with acceptable but worse toxicities compared to HDR boost.

The POPSTAR study (ANZCTR Trial ID: ACTRN12613000436774) enrolled patients with controlled primary cancer and with a presentation of one to three oligometastases. We report the interim results of patterns of failure in this cohort. MATERIAL & METHODS: Patients underwent single fraction 20Gy SABR to each of the 1-3 oligometastasis. Sites of failure after SABR were identified and classified as local, regional (nodes only) or distant. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate progression-free survival (PFS), freedom from local failure (FFLF), freedom from regional failure (FFRF) and freedom from distant failure (FFDF). RESULT(S): With a median follow up of 24 months, 33 patients with 50 oligometastases were enrolled. The mean age was 70 years (range 51-84) and the median PSA level was 6.4 ng/ml. The median time from primary cancer treatment to SABR was 2.9 years (range 0.1-13.9 years) with a primary Gleason score of >= 8 in 44% (n=14). Patients were treated with SABR to bone (n=20), pelvic nodal (n=11), extrapelvic nodal (n=1) and to both bone and nodal (n=1) sites. One, two and three oligometastatic lesions were treated in 67%, 15% and 18% of patients, respectively. No patients died in the study period. The 24-month FFLF and PFS was 93% (95% CI 84-100) and 32% (95% CI 20-54). For patients with bone only oligometastases, 24-month FFLP and FFDP was 89% and 39%. For pelvic nodal only oligometastases the 24-month FFLP, FFRP and FFDP was 100%, 34% and 45%, respectively. Relapses after SABR to pelvic nodes (n=8) were located in the pelvis only (n=4) and both pelvis and extra-pelvic nodes (n=4). Relapses after SABR to bone (n=12) occurred to bone only (n=9), bone and nodes (n=2) and only nodes (n=1), see FIGURE. Salvage RT was performed for 3/12 patients with distant relapse after SABR to bone metastases and 2/8 patients after SABR to pelvic nodes. CONCLUSION(S): For selected patients with metastatic disease, a single treatment session with SABR offers excellent infield tumour control with one third of patients being free from progressive disease at 24 months. Subsequent relapses after SABR to bone or node were generally to the same type. Salvage treatments after limited subsequent relapses are feasible and warrant further investigation.

Lesions in the brain, lung, and liver have been reported as target lesions. However, lymph node oligometastases could be a good candidate for stereotactic body radiotherapy as well. In this study, the usability of stereotactic body radiotherapy for oligometastases to lymph nodes is assessed by researching for each primary site. As a result, we could consider that stereotactic body radiotherapy could be almost well applied for lymph node oligometastases from the breast, gynecological organs, and prostate. However, doubts remain concerning the usefulness of stereotactic body radiotherapy for cervical node metastases from head and neck cancer or for mediastinal node metastases from lung or esophageal cancer since late toxicities have occurred with a large radiation dose at hypofractionation to major vessels or the central respiratory tract, especially in patients with irradiation histories. In addition, high-dose irradiation is required to control lymph node metastases from colorectal cancer due to its radio-resistance, and severe late adverse events would therefore occur in adjacent organs such as the gastrointestinal tract. In cases of lymph node oligometastases with a primary tumor in the stomach or esophagus, stereotactic body radiotherapy should be used limitedly at present because this patient population is not so large and these metastases are often located close to organs at risk. Because of the varied status of recurrence and varied conditions of patients, it is difficult to determine the optimal dose for tumor control. It might be reasonable to determine the treatment dose individually based on dose constraints of adjacent organs. The oligometastatic state is becoming more frequently identified with more sensitive methods of detecting such oligometastases. In addition, there seems to be another type of oligometastases, so-called induced oligometastases, following successful systemic treatment. To determine the optimal indication of stereotactic body radiotherapy for lymph node oligometastases, further investigation about the mechanisms of oligometastases and further clinical studies including a phase III study are needed.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.",exclusion,review,,PM227,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1533033818803597,,,

Its role in high-risk and node-positive prostate cancer, however, is unknown. We hypothesise that a five-fraction schedule of extreme hypofractionation will be non-inferior to a moderately hypofractionated regimen over 5 weeks in efficacy and will have acceptable toxicity and quality of life while reducing the cost implications during treatment. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an ongoing, non-inferiority, multicentre, randomised trial (NCT03561961) of two schedules for National Cancer Control Network high-risk and/or node-positive non-metastatic carcinoma of the prostate. The standard arm will be a schedule of 68 Gy/25# over 5 weeks while the test arm will be extremely hypofractionated radiotherapy with stereotactic body radiation therapy to 36.25 Gy/5# (7 to 10 days). The block randomisation will be stratified by nodal status (N0/N+), hormonal therapy (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone therapy/orchiectomy) and centre. All patients will receive daily image-guided radiotherapy.The primary end point is 4-year biochemical failure free survival (BFFS). The power calculations assume 4-year BFFS of 80% in the moderate hypofractionation arm. With a 5% one-sided significance and 80% power, a total of 434 patients will be randomised to both arms equally (217 in each arm). The secondary end points include overall survival, prostate cancer specific survival, acute and late toxicities, quality of life and out-of-pocket expenditure. DISCUSSION: The trial aims to establish a therapeutically efficacious and cost-efficient modality for high-risk and node-positive prostate cancer with an acceptable toxicity profile. Presently, this is the only trial evaluating and answering such a question in this cohort. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial has been approved by IEC-III of Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai.

We aimed to assess the benefit of MDT in a randomized phase II trial. Material and Methods In this multicentre, randomised, phase II study, asymptomatic PCa patients were eligible in case of a biochemical recurrence following primary PCa treatment with curative intent, three or fewer extracranial metastatic lesions on choline PET-CT and serum testosterone levels >50 ng/ml. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either surveillance or MDT of all detected lesions (surgery or stereotactic body radiotherapy). Surveillance was done with PSA follow-up every 3 months with repeated imaging at PSA progression or clinical suspicion for progression. Randomisation was balanced dynamically on two factors: PSA doubling time (<=3 vs. > 3 months) and nodal vs non-nodal metastases. The primary endpoint was androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-free survival. ADT was started at symptomatic progression, progression to >3 metastases or local progression of known metastases. Results Between August 2012 and August 2015, 62 patients were enrolled. At a median follow-up time of 3 years (IQR 2.3 - 3.75), the median ADT-free survival (figure) was 13 months (80% CI: 12-17) for the surveillance group and 21 months (80% CI: 14-29) for the MDT group (hazard ratio 0.60 [80% CI: 0.40 - 0.90], log-rank p=0.11). On subgroup analysis, no significant interaction was observed between the effect of MDT and PSA doubling time or location of metastases (p-value of interaction: 0.35 and 0.31 respectively). The PSA change is depicted as a waterfall plot as the largest change in PSA. In total, 74% of patients treated with MDT had a PSA decline as compared to 42% in the surveillance arm. The median time until PSA progression for the ITT was 6 months (95%CI: 3.85 - 8.15) for the surveillance group as compared to 10 months (5.46 - 14.55) for the MDT group (HR = 0.53, 95%CI: 0.30- 0.94, p = 0.03). Quality of life was similar between arms at baseline and remained comparable at 3 months and 1 year follow-up. Six patients developed grade 1 toxicity in the MDT arm.

PET/CT now offers improved sensitivity and accuracy in staging. Recent randomized trial data supports escalated hormone therapy, local primary tumor therapy, and metastasis-directed therapy. The impact of combining such therapies into a multimodal approach is unknown. This Phase II single-arm clinical trial sponsored and funded by Veterans Affairs combines local, metastasis-directed, and systemic therapies to durably render patients free of detectable disease off active therapy. Method(s): Patients with newly-diagnosed M1a/b prostate cancer (PSMA PET/CT staging is permitted) and 1-5 radiographically visible metastases (excluding pelvic lymph nodes) are undergoing local treatment with radical prostatectomy, limited duration systemic therapy for a total of six months (leuprolide, abiraterone acetate with prednisone, and apalutamide), metastasis-directed stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), and post-operative fractionated radiotherapy if pT >= 3a, N1, or positive margins are present. The primary endpoint is the percent of patients achieving a serum PSA of < 0.05 ng/mL six months after recovery of serum testosterone >=150 ng/dL. Secondary endpoints include time to biochemical progression, time to radiographic progression, time to initiation of alternative antineoplastic therapy, prostate cancer specific survival, health related quality-of-life, safety and tolerability.

Therefore, we sought to evaluate clinical effects of combinatorial AR-targeted therapy, including indomethacin (Indo) to inhibit the steroidogenic enzyme AKR1C3, in men with high risk PC undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP). Method(s): This was an open label, single-site, Phase II neoadjuvant trial in men with localized high to very-high risk PC, as defined by NCCN criteria. Patients received 12 weeks of neoadjuvant apalutamide (Apa), abiraterone (Abi) plus prednisone, degarelix, and Indo at their respective FDA-approved doses followed by RP. The primary objective was to determine the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate. Secondary objectives included assessing for minimal residual disease (MRD) (i.e. <=0.25 Cm3 tumor volume corrected for cellularity), measuring intraprostatic androgens and assessing molecular features associated with drug resistance. Twenty evaluable patients provided 91% power (one- sided alpha = 7.5%) to detect a difference in pCR rate of 5% (H0) vs. 25% (H1). Result(s): Twenty-two patients enrolled and 20 were evaluable for the primary endpoint (1 patient came off to pursue stereotactic radiosurgery; 1 was removed after developing grade 2 transaminitis). At baseline, the median PSA was 10.1 ng/mL (4.4-159.4), 4 (20%) patients had Gleason grade group (GG) 4 disease and 16 had GG 5 disease. At RP, 1 (5%) patient had a pCR, 6 (30%) had MRD, 18 (90%) had ypT3 disease and 7 (35%) had lymph node (LN) metastases. Treatment was generally well tolerated and adverse events were consistent with each individual drug's known safety profile. Additional follow up data and correlative work will be presented at the meeting. Conclusion(s): In our cohort of men with high-risk PC, pCR rates remained low even with combinatorial AR-directed therapy.

random-journal.pdf,ProP296,"I., Heidegger",2017,English,#2;pro.m:#2,The importance of imaging studies to monitor treatment with novel ar-targeted agents in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC),"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Abiraterone acetate (AA/ P) and enzalutamide (ENZ) represent the treatment of choice in men with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic mCRPC. Altough serial PSA measurements are required to monitor response and progression, the role of serial imaging studies is unclear in daily routine. It was the purpose of our study to evaluate the potential additional benefit of imaging to monitor the disease. METHOD(S): A total of 56 patients with mCRPC underwent systemic first line treatment with ENZ or AA/P after failing primary LHRH-therapy. Mean serum testosterone was 34.4 (18 - 48) ng/dl. Patients underwent analysis of the serum markers PSA, alk. Phosphatase, CRP, hemoglobine, and LDH at 3-months intervals. In addition imaging studies were repeated at 3-months intervals or in case of PSA or symptomatic progression. RESULT(S): Mean duration of AA/P treatment is 12.7 (2-19) months and mean duration of ENZ therapy is 17.2 (3- 29) months. A PSA-response was achieved in 76% and 81% in the AA/P and the ENZ group, respectively. Beside PSA, responding patients in the AA/P group demonstrated a significant decrease in serum concentrations of LDH (367,96 225,4U/l) and alk. Phosphatase (249,59 117U/l) whereas responding pts in the ENZ group demonstrated a decrease in LDH only (339,5 228,33U/l). Median duration of PSA response is 10.8 and 11.5 months in the AA/P and the ENZ group, respectively. Despite stable serum levels of 0.6 (0.2-0.9) ng/ml and an asymptomatic status, 8 patients exhibited a significant radiographic progression in number and size of lymph node metastases (n=5) or skeletal metastases (n=3). 4 pts underwent local therapy of the progressing site by stereotactic radiation and in 4 pts treatment was switched to docetaxel. CONCLUSION(S): Despite considerable and stable PSAresponse 15% of our patients exhibited significant metastatic progression which would not have been detected without serial imaging studies. Therefore, we strongly advocate imaging studies even in the presence of stable PSA serum levels.",exclusion,Not dealing with the intervention of interest,,PM236,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results)-Medicare we identified men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2007 and 2011. We developed physician-hospital networks by identifying the treating physician of each patient based on the primary treatment received and subsequently assigning each physician to a hospital. We examined the relative distribution of prostate cancer treatments stratified by whether stereotactic body radiation therapy was performed in a network by fitting logistic regression models with robust SEs to account for patient clustering in networks. RESULTS: We identified 344 physician-hospital networks, including 30 (8.7%) and 314 (91.3%) in which stereotactic body radiation therapy was and was not performed, respectively. Networks in which that therapy was and was not done did not differ with time in the performance of robotic and radical prostatectomy, and active surveillance (all p >0.05). The relationship with intensity modulated radiation therapy did not show any consistent temporal pattern. In networks in which it was performed less intensity modulated radiation therapy was initially done but there were similar rates in later years. Brachytherapy trends differed among networks in which stereotactic body radiation therapy was vs was not performed with a lower brachytherapy rate in networks in which stereotactic body radiation therapy was done (p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Surgery and active surveillance rates did not differ in networks in which stereotactic body radiation therapy was vs was not performed but when that therapy was done there was a lower brachytherapy rate. Stereotactic body radiation therapy may represent more of an alternative to brachytherapy than to active surveillance.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,10.1097/JU.0000000000000471,,,

In addition to the benefits of an overall treatment time reduction, profound hypofractionation could result in therapeutic gain given the radiobiology of prostate cancer. Evidence suggests SBRT to be safe and effective; however randomised data is lacking comparing outcomes with standard treatment options. Aim(s): To assess whether SBRT offers therapeutic benefit in comparison to prostatectomy or standard radiotherapy. Method(s): The PACE trial is an international multicentre phase III trial, comprising two parallel randomisation processes. Within PACE A, potential surgical candidates are randomised between radical prostatectomy and SBRT (36.25 Gy in 5 fractions). In PACE B, randomisation is between standard radiotherapy (78Gy in 39 fractions or 62Gy in 20 fractions) and SBRT (36.35Gy in 5 fractions). SBRT can be delivered using Cyberknife or gantry based techniques. Patients with low or intermediate risk prostate cancer are eligible for the trial, and are treated without the use androgen deprivation therapy. Follow up is for a period of 10 years. The aim is to recruit 234 patients to PACE A (117 in each arm) and 858 patients to PACE B (429 patients in each arm). Primary Objectives: PACE A: To determine whether there is improved quality of life after SBRT compared with surgery at 2 years post treatment, using EPIC score to measure urinary incontinence and bowel bother. PACE B: to determine whether SBRT is non-inferior to surgery in terms of freedom from biochemical/clinical failure at 5 years from randomisation. Progress: PACE A has been slower to recruit than anticipated due to the difficulties of a surgery versus radiotherapy randomisation. However, it is expected to reach target accrual, having recruited 57 patients from 3 centres. In contrast, PACE B is recruiting exceptionally well, open in 40 centres, and as of October 2017 recruited 762 patients. Accrual target is expected to be reached by the end of 2017.",inclusion,,Crec que només descriu el protocol però caldria comprovar-ho i veure si hi ha publicacions posteriors sobre aquest estudi,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2018.36.6_suppl.TPS153,exclusion,Congress abstract.

Despite that, in literature there is a lack of data about the role of SBRT in patients (pts) with oligoprogressive castrate resistant PC (oligo-CRPC). Our aim is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of SBRT in the treatment of oligorecurrent PC in terms of biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS) and ADT-free survival (ADT-FS) and also in pts with oligo-CRPC, in terms of distant progression free survival (DPFS) and second line systemic-treatment-free survival (STFS). Material and Methods non-castrate pts with oligorecurrent disease detected with Choline-PET or CT+Scintigraphy following biochemical recurrence were treated with SBRT. BPFS and ADT-FS were the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were local control and toxicity. On the other hand, oligo- CRPC pts detected with choline-PET or CT+scintigraphy after PSA rise during ADT were enrolled in the analysis. Primary endpoint were DPFS and STFS. Univariate analysis was performed in order to assess factors influencing outcome in both categories. Results 100 pts with oligorecurrent PC (139 lesions; lymph nodes 84.2%, bones 15.8%) were treated from 03/2010 to 02/2016. After a median follow up of 20.4 months, 1yrand 2yrs-BPFS were 58.1% and 38.3%. 15 pts underwent a second course of SBRT for a further oligoprogression: this result in a median ADT-FS of 20.9 months with 1-, 2-, 3- yrs ADT-FS of 67.4%, 47.3% and 31%. At univariate analysis, low PSA-DT is related with a worse ADT-FS. LC rate was 88,2% at two years. No G3 toxicity was reported. 41 pts with oligo-CRPC (70 lesions) were treated from 01/2010 to 04/2016. After a median follow up of 23.43 months, 1yrand 2yrs-DPFS were 43.2% and 21.6% with a median DPFS of 11 months. 10 pts underwent a second course of SBRT. At the time of analysis, 20 patients had started systemic treatment (10 pts with Abiraterone or Enzalutamide and 10 pts with Docetaxel): median STFS was 22 months with 1-, 2-, 3-yrs STFS of 74.8%, 41.3% and 29.5%. No significant correlations were found at univariate analysis. No toxicity was registered. Conclusion SBRT for oligorecurrent PC is an effective treatment and postpones palliative ADT for almost 2 yrs without toxicity. SBRT has proven effective even in oligoprogressive CRPC with a capacity to delay the start of systemic second line therapies for almost 2 yrs.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,,,,

We report post-SABR toxicity from a prospective clinical trial. Method(s): In the FASTRACK clinical trial, patients with primary RCC received single fraction 26 Gy SABR for tumours <5 cm, or 3 x 14 Gy of SABR for tumours >=5 cm. Patients underwent 51Cr-EDTA calculated GFR assessment and 99mTc-DMSA SPECT/CT prior to treatment, ~90 days posttherapy, and in a subset of patients at 1 year. Serum creatinine was measured 3-monthly. Toxicity rates were scored using CTCAE v4.0 Results: From July 2012 to August 2013, 21 patients were enrolled on trial. The median follow-up was 12 months. 9/21 patients were referred due to the likely need for post-surgery dialysis. Median (range) age was 77 (41-91) years old. The mean (range) tumour size was 48 mm (21-75 mm). There were no grade 3+ toxicities recorded. Grade 2 toxicity was 10% (commonly fatigue), and 29% of patients were asymptomatic from treatment. The mean (+/- SD) GFR at baseline was 52 +/- 24 mls/min and was 55 +/- 32 mls/min at ~90 days (p = 0.17). 14 patients underwent late GFR scanning (median of 350 days post SABR), with a decrease in mean (+/- SD) GFR from baseline to 45 +/- 14 mls/min (p = 0.03). The mean (range) loss in renal split function to the irradiated kidney as recorded on SPECT imaging was 4.1% (0.53%-13.09%) at 3 months and 10.5% (1.95%- 19.75 %) at 1 year. The mean serum creatinine at 1-year post SABR was 162 umol/L compared to baseline of 131 umol/L (p = 0.02). No patient required dialysis. Conclusion(s): SABR for primary inoperable RCC appears tolerable and is associated with low toxicity rates in the short to medium term. Despite an older study population with pre-existing kidney disease, none of the patients required renal replacement therapy. On-going assessment of late renal function change is warranted.

There is mixed evidence if these declines impact health-related sexual quality of life (HRSQOL). Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) uses image guidance and small margins, and the testes may be less sensitive to hypofractionation. We characterized HRSQOL in men treated with SBRT and assessed for correlations with changes in serum testosterone level. Materials/Methods: From 2009 - 2014, 417 men with localized prostate cancer were treated with SBRT per a prospective single institution protocol. HRSQOL was collected via the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) questionnaire. All men had pre-treatment HRSQOL and serum testosterone assessments, and none received androgen deprivation therapy. We assessed HRSQOL scores and testosterone levels at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years post-SBRT. Minimally important difference (MID) thresholds in HRSQOL scores were assessed and were defined as decline in the EPIC-26 HRSQOL score of >=11 (1xMID). We also assessed 2xMID (>=22 point decline). HRSQOL score changes were compared via a paired samples t-test. Logistic regression modeling was used to assess predictors of 1xMID and 2xMID at various time points. Result(s): Median follow-up was 48.3 months (IQR 30.6-63.9). Median patient age was 69 years. Most patients (88%) had testosterone data and HRSQOL scores 2 years post-SBRT. There was a significant decline in HRSQOL from baseline (median 61.2) to 6 months (median 52.8, p<0.01), 1 year (median 43.8, p<0.01), and 2 years post-SBRT (median 44.5, p<0.01). Post-SBRT, 32%, 38%, and 45% of men had a 1xMID at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years post-SBRT, respectively, and 18%, 24%, and 27% of men had a 2xMID at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years post-SBRT, respectively. Median serum testosterone levels declined from pre-treatment (337 ng/dl) to 6 months post-SBRT (289 ng/dL, p<0.01) but increased to nearly baseline by 2 years post-SBRT (304 ng/dL, p<0.01). There was no association between decline in serum testosterone post-SBRT and a 1xMID or 2xMID at any time point, even in men with upper quartile baseline testosterone levels or HRSQOL. Only baseline HRSQOL and age at time of SBRT were significantly associated with declines in HRSQOL. Conclusion(s): Men treated with prostate SBRT for prostate cancer experience a small non-clinically relevant transient decline in testosterone that does not significantly impact HRSQOL. Men with diminished HRSQOL did not have greater testosterone declines than men who did not. HRSQOL decline should be attributed to neurovascular effects of radiotherapy rather than scatter dose to the testes. An ongoing randomized trial assessing vessel sparing SBRT may be able to minimize long-term declines in HRSQOL.Copyright © 2019",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.06.1891,,,

METHODS: Using nationwide Medicare claims from 2011 to 2014, we identified radiation episodes for bone metastasis from prostate, lung, and breast cancer. Details regarding fractionation, radiation therapy (RT) modality, and sociodemographic characteristics were abstracted from claims. Time trends in use of 10 or fewer RT fractions per episode were evaluated using the Cochran-Armitage test. Total cost per episode was calculated from a payer's perspective and reported in 2017 dollars; time trends in cost were assessed using linear regression. Generalized linear models identified predictors of treatment with 10 or fewer fractions. RESULTS: Of 51,533 episodes identified, 46,326 used 2D/3D RT, 3,199 used intensity-modulated RT, and 2,008 used stereotactic body RT. The proportion of 2D/3D RT episodes using 10 or fewer fractions increased from 65.5% to 79.7% ( P(trend) < .001), and mean total cost per episode decreased from $6,742 to $6,067 ( P(trend) < .001). Use of single-fraction radiation increased modestly for 2D/3D treatment (6.5% to 8.1%; P(trend) < .001). Predictors of 10 or fewer fractions included treatment in recent years, advanced age (≥ 85 years), and higher comorbidity score. Variation was noted based on geographic region and primary cancer. CONCLUSION: During a period with quality initiatives launched by the American Society for Radiation Oncology, American Board of Internal Medicine, and National Quality Forum, use of 10 or fewer fractions for bone metastasis increased by 14.2%, but single-fraction regimens increased by only 1.6%, highlighting opportunities for quality improvement.",exclusion,Other tumor treated (skeletal),,PM241,10.1200/JOP.18.00588,,,

The objectives of the Novel Integration of New prostate radiation schedules with adJuvant Androgen deprivation (NINJA) clinical trial are to compare two emerging SBRT regimens for efficacy with technical substudies focussing on MRI only planning and the use of knowledge-based planning (KBP) to assess radiotherapy plan quality. Methods and analysis Eligible patients must have biopsy-proven unfavourable intermediate or favourable high-risk PC, have an Eastern Collaborative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1 and provide written informed consent. All patients will receive 6 months in total of androgen deprivation therapy. Patients will be randomised to one of two SBRT regimens. The first will be 40 Gy in five fractions given on alternating days (SBRT monotherapy). The second will be 20 Gy in two fractions given 1 week apart followed 2 weeks later by 36 Gy in 12 fractions given five times per week (virtual high-dose rate boost (HDRB)). The primary efficacy outcome will be biochemical clinical control at 5 years. Secondary endpoints for the initial portion of NINJA look at the transition of centres towards MRI only planning and the impact of KBP on real-time (RT) plan assessment. The first 150 men will demonstrate accrual feasibility as well as addressing the KBP and MRI planning aims, prior to proceeding with total accrual to 472 patients as a phase III randomised controlled trial. Ethics and dissemination NINJA is a multicentre cooperative clinical trial comparing two SBRT regimens for men with PC. It builds on promising results from several single-armed studies, and explores radiation dose escalation in the Virtual HDRB arm.

METHODS: Patients who were treated with SBRT to nonspine bone metastases were identified by retrospective chart review. An independent musculoskeletal radiologist evaluated response to treatment using computed tomography (CT) scans. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were treated to 42 nonspine bone metastases. The most common primary cancer cites were renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (33.3%), lung (24.2%), and prostate (18.2%). Bone metastases were either mainly lytic (57.1%), mainly sclerotic (28.6%), or mixed (14.3%). When lytic and sclerotic lesions were evaluated according to RECIST 1.1, local control (LC) was 83%, 85%, 88%, and 80% for those with CT imaging between months 1 to 3, 4 to 6, 7 to 9, and 10 to 12, respectively. When evaluated by the MDA criteria by density, LC within each time period was slightly greater. Overall LC decreased considerably when evaluated by MDA in terms of size.

The 2-fraction cohort had a significantly lower rate of bowel MCIC (17.8% vs 42.3%, p = 0.01), but there was no difference in urinary (24.1% vs 35.7%) or sexual (15.3% vs 29.2%) MCIC. For MCIC x2 (moderate QOL change), the 2-fraction trial had significantly lower MCIC rates in both the bowel (7.1% vs 24%, p = 0.04) and sexual (0 vs 17.6%, p = 0.01) domains. Conclusion(s): 2-Fraction SABR is feasible to deliver and well tolerated, with significant signals of improved bowel and sexual QOL.

Patients and Methods: From 2012 to 2017, 154 patients (92 with unfavourable intermediate-risk or high-risk PCa) were treated with helical TomoTherapy delivering 43.8-45.2 Gy in eight fractions over 3 weeks. Of these, 73% received hormonotherapy (51% neoadjuvant). Result(s): The median (range) follow-up was 48 (19-84) months. For the whole series, crude BDFS and 5-year BDFS rates were 97.4% and 94.3%, respectively. The corresponding figures for unfavourable intermediate-risk and high-risk PCa were 96.7% and 90%, respectively. The crude metastasis-free survival rate was 98% for the unfavourable intermediate-risk and high-risk group. For the whole series, the 5-year cumulative urinary/intestinal grade 2+ late toxicity was 17.8/7.4%. No grade 4-5 toxicity was observed. One patient experienced late grade 3 toxicity (urinary). Conclusion(s): This eight-fraction UHRT regimen can be safely delivered to patients with unfavourable intermediate-risk/high-risk PCa. Its relapse rates are similar to those reported for the combination of external beam radiotherapy plus brachytherapy, however, the observed toxicity profile is milder. The disease survival rates compare favourably with historical controls in some other forms of radiotherapy, with similar side effects. Since the low rate of biochemical/metastasis relapse is encouraging, further research to confirm these results is justified.Copyright © 2019 The Authors BJU International published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of BJU International",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,"Assegurar que comparar amb ""historic controls"" no és un comparador vàlid i que no interessa la ultra-hypofractionated radiation therapy",PM244,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bju.14925,,,

random-journal.pdf,ProP313,"F., Alongi",2019,English,pro.p,Updated results of a Phase II study on 5 fractions FFF SBRT for low and intermediate prostate cancer,"Purpose or Objective: SBRT had been shown to be a potential treatment option for localized prostate cancer (PC) in selected population. Usually, prostate SBRT has been delivered every other day in order to favour normal tissues recovery, minimizing side effects. Flattening Filter Free (FFF) delivery is a treatment modality able to reduce treatment beam-on time, decreasing patient positioning uncertainties. We reported feasibility, side effects and biochemical control of FFF SBRT delivered in 5 consecutive days in a cohort of patients affected by localized PC. Material(s) and Method(s): The study, approved by Ethical Committee, started on January 2014. Inclusion criteria were: age <= 80 years, World Health Organization performance status <= 2, histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma, low-to-intermediate risk according to D'Amico criteria, no distant metastases, no previous surgery other than TURP, no other malignant tumor in the previous 5 years, a pre-SBRT International Prostatic Symptoms Score (IPSS) ranged between 0 and 7. The SBRT-schedules were: 35Gy for low risk and 37.5Gy for intermediate risk PC in 5 fractions, delivered in 5 consecutive days. SBRT was delivered with volumetric modulated radiation therapy (VMAT). Toxicity assessment was performed according to CTCAE v4.0 scale. Neoadjuvant/concomitant hormonal-therapy was prescribed according to risk classification. Results Fifty-two patients were enrolled at the time of analysis. Median age was 73 years (55-83), Median follow-up was 33 months (range: 6-55 months). Thirty-four (65.3%) had a low-risk PC and 18 (34.6%) an intermediate-risk PC. Median initial PSA was 5.9 ng/ml (range, 1.8-15.7 ng/ml). Median Gleason score was 6 (6-7). Median IPSS pre-SBRT was 4.5 (range, 0 - 7). All patients completed the treatment as planned. Acute G1-2 toxicity occurred in 18 (34.6%) patients and was distributed as follows: 8 (15.3%) cases of G1 gastrointestinal toxicity, 1 (1.9%) patients had G2 gastrointestinal toxicity, 5 (9.6%) patients reported G2 genitourinary toxicity and 11 (21.1%) G1 genitourinary toxicity. Patients may have experienced more than one toxicity. Late G1 gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in 5 (9.6%) patients. No G3 toxicities occurred. At the last follow-up median IPSS was 3 (1-19) and median PSA was 0.315 ng/ml (range 0.04-7.965 ng/ml). Biochemical control was 98%. Conclusion(s): The results of our study showed that FFF SBRT in 5 fractions for low-to-intermediate PC is feasible and well tolerated.

Material and Methods From 08/2012 to 12/2015, 170 patients (pts) from nine European centers with cT1c-3a N0 M0 PCa and a low risk of nodal involvement (<=20%, according to Roach et al.) were recruited and randomized according to two different overall treatment time (OTT) schedules: either 9 days (arm A, 84 pts), or 28 days, once-a-week, the same weekday (arm B, 86 pts). The prescribed dose was 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy to the prostate +/- seminal vesicles in both arms. The prostatic urethra, with a surrounding margin of 3 mm, received a lesser dose of 5 x 6.5 Gy = 32.5 Gy. All patients were treated either with a VMAT or IMRT technique under stereotactic conditions using Novalis linacs and ExacTrac image-guided technology. Genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (CTCAE v4.0 grading scale), IPSS, and QoL scores (EORTC QLQ-PR25) were assessed at baseline, at the 5th fraction (5fx), and 12th weeks (12W) since SBRT start. Results 82 (median age 70 years) and 83 (median age 69 years) pts, respectively, from arms A and B, were retained for this analysis. Low-, intermediate-, and high-risk presentation was respectively 22%, 63%, and 15% (arm A) and 22%, 64%, and 14% (arm B). A 6-months androgen deprivation was used in 44% and 45% of the pts in arm A and B, respectively. The toxicity stopping rule of the study during the first 3-months was never activated. In both arms, Grade 1 GI toxicity increased from baseline to 5fx (from 19.5% to 38% and from 23% to 32% for arms A and B, respectively) returning back to baseline by W12 (18% for Arm A and 25% for Arm B). Only 2 cases of grade 2 GI toxicity (2.5%) were observed at 5fx in arm A. Grade 2 GU toxicity rates at baseline, 5fx, and W12 were 2%, 17%, and 11% vs. 5%, 19% and 6% in arms A and B, respectively (mainly moderate irritative and voiding symptoms). Only one grade 3 GU toxicity was observed at W12 in arm B (desobstructive TURP in a patient with a preexisting history of acute urinary retention). Median IPSS scores at the same endpoints were 6, 10, and 6 vs. 6, 10, and 7 for arms A and B, respectively, with similar IPSS-based QoL rates at baseline and W12 (80% of pts satisfied). No changes in EORTC QLQ-PR25 scores for GU, GI, and sexual domains were observed in both arms between baseline and W12.

Materials/Methods: Dosimetric data of the first 40 patients randomized between 07/2012 and 03/2014 in 9 different centers were analyzed. The SBRT protocol consisted of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy to the planning target volume (PTV=prostate with (n=20) or without (n=20) seminal vesicles (SV) with a 5-mm anisotropic expansion, except 3-mm posteriorly). The prostatic urethra with an additional margin of 3 mm (urethral planning risk volume, uPRV) received simultaneously 5 x 6.5 Gy = 32.5 Gy. Plans were generated using either VMAT (n=20) or IMRT (n=20) technique, with each modality including (n=10) or not (n=10) SV in the PTV. All plans were optimized until the dose prescription parameters and organs at risk (OAR) dose-volume constraints were obtained. Mean doses (+/- SD) to the PTV, uPRV, and remaining OAR were analyzed. The PTV homogeneity index (HI) and the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) were also assessed. To evaluate the learning curve effect in VMAT optimization, VMAT plans of the first 20 patients were compared with VMAT plans generated in the last 20 randomized patients (05/2014-08/2015). Result(s): Compared to IMRT plans, VMAT required a lower number of MU (2245 vs. 3685, p=.0001) and resulted in a better HI (0.90 vs. 0.11, p=.002) and uPRV coverage (D98% 31.2 vs. 30.1 Gy, p=.001). Regardless of the RT technique, dose constraints were respected for all OAR. The V100, V90 and V80 for the rectal wall were 1.6+/-1.4% vs. 2.5+/-1.9% (ref. <5%), 10.3+/-3.0% vs. 11.0+/-3.3% (ref. <10-15%) and 16.2+/-3.7% vs. 14.8+/-4.2 (ref. <20-25%) for IMRT and VMAT patients, respectively, with no significant differences between the two techniques. For the bladder wall, the V100 and V90 were similar for IMRT and VMAT (7.8+/-3.7% vs. 7.0+/-3.8%, ref. <10- 15% and 15.3+/-4.0% vs. 13.1+/-4.8%, ref. <20%), while VMAT performed better than IMRT for the V50 (28.4+/-11.6% vs. 37.2+/-9.2% (ref. <50%), p=.011). Compared to the first VMAT optimizations, plans generated in the last part of the study showed a better PTV DSC value (0.88 vs 0.78, p=.009), a reduced V100 (1.3 vs. 2.5%, p=.023) for the rectal wall, and an overall better bladder sparing (V100, V90 and V80, p<.05). Conclusion(s): For all participating centers, urethra-sparing SBRT plans met all the dosimetric endpoints in terms of PTV coverage as well as OAR sparing, irrespectively of the technique used. Compared with IMRT, VMAT plans resulted in more homogeneous dose distribution, reduced number of MU, and better uPRV coverage.

The prescribed dose was 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy to the prostate planning target volume (PTV) with (n=92) or without (n=73) inclusion of the seminal vesicles (SV) (5-mm isotropic expansion, with a 3-mm posterior margin). The urethra planning risk volume (uPRV=prostatic urethra+3-mm margin) was planned to receive 32.5 Gy. Patients were treated either with a volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) (n=112, 72 with SV) or intensity modulated RT (IMRT) (n=53, 20 with SV) technique under stereotactic conditions using Novalis linacs and ExacTrac image-guided technology. Dosimetric results, PTV homogeneity index (HI), Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), number of monitor units (MU), as well as deviations from protocol dose constraints were retrospectively analyzed and compared between pts treated with a VMAT vs. IMRT technique. Result(s): Major protocol deviations occurred for 52 pts (32%), mostly for uPRV (12%) and PTV (5%) coverage, and for the rectal (RW) and bladder wall (BW) V90% (7%, each) (Table 1), while minor deviations occurred for 67 pts (41%). For PTV and uPRV coverage, deviations were more frequent in the IMRT group (p=0.001 and p<0.0001, resp.). As compared to IMRT, treatment planning with VMAT resulted in a slightly better uPRV coverage (D98%=31.1 vs. 30.6 Gy, p<0.0001), less MU (2335 vs. 3454, p<0.0001), and better HI (0.09 vs. 0.11, p<0.0001) and DSC (0.85 vs. 0.75, p<0.0001) values. Moreover, VMAT yielded better dosimetric parameters for the BW V50% (26.1% vs. 33.3%, p=0.0001) and the penile bulb (PB) Dmean (30.7 vs. 31.1 Gy, p=0.008), while other dosimetric parameters were similar. The inclusion of the SV in the PTV impacted negatively on the RW V90% (9.1% without vs. 10.4% with, p=0.0003) and RW V80% (13.2% without vs. 15.7% with, p=0.0003).

Patients were treated either with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT; n = 112) or with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT; n = 53). Deviations from protocol dose constraints, planning target volume (PTV) homogeneity index, PTV Dice similarity coefficient, and number of monitor units for each treatment plan were retrospectively analyzed. Dosimetric results of VMAT versus IMRT and treatment plans with versus without inclusion of SV were compared. Result(s): At least 1 major protocol deviation occurred in 51 patients (31%), whereas none was observed in 41. Protocol violations were more frequent in the IMRT group (P <.001). Furthermore, the use of VMAT yielded better dosimetric results than IMRT for urethra planning-risk volume D98% (31.1 vs 30.8 Gy, P <.0001), PTV D2% (37.9 vs 38.7 Gy, P <.0001), homogeneity index (0.09 vs 0.10, P <.0001), Dice similarity coefficient (0.83 vs 0.80, P <.0001), and bladder wall V50% (24.5% vs 33.5%, P =.0001).

In these patients (pts) the use of aggressive local treatment, as radiotherapy, may be potentially justified rather than a systemic approach. We report clinical experience of a small group of pts with Ol-PCa recurrence and treated with SBRTon positive lesions at 18Fcholine PET/CT (18F-CH). Matherials and Methods: From 2011 to September 2015, 18 pts with Ol-PCa recurrence at 18F-CH, were treated with SBRT on PET-positive lesions (mean age: 69 years; range: 56-81). All pts underwent radical prostatectomy at time of first diagnosis and 11 of them also received adjuvant/salvage radiotherapy (RT). At staging, we found 3 high-risk PCa, 9 very high-risk PCa, and 1 intermediate-risk PCa; Gleason Score (GS) was less than 7 in 1 pts, equal to 7 in 8 pts, and exceeding 7 in 9 pts. Median time to clinical relapse after primary treatment (surgery +/- RT) was 26.2 months (range: 3-141). Nine pts received one or more lines of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) before RT. Mean and median PSA before SBRT was 3.01 ng/ml and 1.9 ng/mL (range: 0.69-14.9), respectively. SBRT was delivered on 18F-CH positive nodal recurrence (N-MTS) in 16 pts, and in 2 pts with positive bone metastases (B-MTS); it was delivered in association with ADT in 6 pts, while the treatment was exclusive in the other 13 pts. We analyzed outcomes in terms of local control (LC), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): All pts were alive at a mean and median follow-up (15.5 and 18.3 months, respectively) (range: 2,5-58). Fourteen pts were treated with SBRT to 1 site (abdominal node: 12 pts; bone lesion: 2 pts), while 4 pts were treated to 2 different sites (all nodal). One-Year OS was 100% while mean and median PFS were respectively 19.7 and 13.1 (CI95% 5.3-21) months. One-year PFS were 52.7%, while LC was 100%. In terms of PFS, we have not found significant statistical prognostic factors: only adiuvant ADT and no concomitant treatments (SBRT exclusive) seemed to have a positive impact on PFS with a 1-year PFS of 60.0% for hormone-naive pts. Conclusion(s): In pts with Ol-PCa recurrence, 18F-CH has proved to be useful in plannig SBRT, a non invasive loco-regional approach, with the aim of reducing side effects of more invasive treatments.",exclusion,Other study design + no comparator,,PM247,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00259-016-3484-4,,,

The benefit of ADT with SBRT is unknown. The purpose of this study is to examine ADT utilization with SBRT in the US. Method(s): Men > 40 years old with localized PC treated with external beam RT for curative intent between 2004-2015 were analyzed from the National Cancer Database. Patients who received brachytherapy, surgery, or lacked ADT or risk stratification data were excluded. A total of 7,559 men treated with SBRT (>5Gy/fraction; <5 fractions; dose >25Gy) versus 133,825 men treated with moderate or conventional RT (<3Gy/fraction; dose >60Gy) were included. Patients were stratified by risk: low (LR), favorable intermediate (FIR), UIR, and HR using NCCN criteria. Differences between RT and SBRT were determined via Chi-square test. Result(s): Among all PC treated with RT, SBRT use increased from 2004 to 2015 across risk groups - overall: 0.9% to 10.3%; LR: 0.9% to 21.6%; FIR: 1.1% to 13.7%; UIR: 0.6% to 10.8%; H R: 0.8% to 2.8%; p < 0.001. Among all PC treated with RT, ADT use declined from 2004 to 2015 for LR (22.8% to 5.5%), FIR (51.7% to 40.0%), UIR (53.4% to 49.5%), but not HR (78.9% to 84.2%); p < 0.001. Patients with EBRT were more likely to receive ADT compared to those with SBRT across risk groups (Table). Conclusion(s): The majority of patients receiving SBRT for UIR and HR disease in the US do not receive concurrent ADT, despite national guideline recommendations and the lack of level 1 evidence to support this practice pattern. The omission of ADT may result in inferior oncologic outcomes, and randomized trials are needed to establish the safety of omitting ADT with SBRT for higher risk PC.",exclusion,"No és randomitzat, sí compara intervencions però de forma retrospectiva",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2020.38.6_suppl.370,,,
random-journal.pdf,ProP321,"Kam, Tsz Yeung",2019,eng,1 population;pro.m:#5,Utilization of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy in oligometastatic & oligoprogressive skeletal metastases: Results and pattern of failure.,"AIM: To evaluate the outcome and toxicities of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for skeletal metastasis in a tertiary cancer center. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of 22 patients treated with SABR for skeletal metastases for oligometastases (OM) or oligoprogression (OP) since October 2012. There are a total of 27 treatments with 20 spinal and seven non-spinal metastases. Treatment outcome including local control (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), pain control, treatment-related toxicity and failure pattern are described. Patients are assessed by interval computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography-CT, magnetic resonance imaging or bone scintigraphy by physicians' discretion. Toxicities are graded by common toxicities criteria version 4.03. RESULT: The median age of the patients is 64 years. Primary sites include lung (50%), breast (32%), nasopharynx (9%), prostate (4.5%) and colon (4.5%). Twelve patients with OM and 10 with OP are included. Dose to most spinal and non-spinal metastases is 35 and 50 Gy, respectively, in five fractions. With a median follow up of 15.6 months, there are three local failures (1-year LC 91.2%). The median PFS and OS are 10.1 and 37.3 months, while PFS of OP and OM group is 6.6 and 10.6 months, respectively. Two-third of symptomatic patients have at least 1-year complete pain control. There are two vertebral fractures and one grade 3 esophagitis. CONCLUSION: Our series shows excellent LC of SABR to skeletal metastases with limited toxicities in OM and OP diseases. However, its benefit of survival warrants further studies.",exclusion,Other tumor treated (skeletal),,PM249,10.1111/ajco.13115,,,

Material and Methods From 08/2012 through 12/2015, 170 patients (pts) from nine European institutions with cT1c-3aN0M0 PCa and a low risk of nodal involvement (<=20%, according to Roach et al.) were recruited and randomized according to two different overall treatment time (OTT) schedules: Either 9 days (arm A, 84 pts), or 28 days, once-a-week, the same week-day (arm B, 86 pts).The prescribed dose was 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy to the prostate +/- seminal vesicles in both arms. The prostatic urethra, with a surrounding margin of 3 mm, received a lesser dose of 5 x 6.5 Gy = 32.5 Gy. All patients were treated either with a VMAT or IMRT technique under stereotactic conditions using Novalis linacs and ExacTrac image-guided technology. Genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (CTCAE v4.03 grading scale), IPSS, and QoL scores (EORTC QLQ-PR25) were assessed at baseline, at the 5thfraction (5fx), 12th weeks (12W) (acute toxicity) and every 6 months since SBRT. Results 82 (median age 70 years) and 83 (median age 69 years) pts, respectively, from arms A and B, were retained for this analysis (5 out of 170 randomized pts were never treated). Low-, intermediate-, and high-risk presentation was respectively 22%, 63%, and 15% (arm A) and 22%, 64%, and 14% (arm B). Six-month androgen deprivation was used in 44% and 45% of pts in arm A and B, respectively. A toxicity stopping rule was activated during the first 3-months of patients' follow-up though was never triggered. Grade-2 GU toxicity rates at baseline, 5fx, and W12 were 2%, 17%, and 11% vs. 5%, 19% and 6% for pts in arms A and B, respectively (mainly moderate irritative and voiding symptoms). Only one case of obstructive grade-3 GU toxicity was observed at W12 in arm B (TURP-dependent). Two cases of grade-2 GI toxicity (2.5%) were observed at 5fx in arm A. During months 6 to 18, the incidence of grade-2 GU toxicity was 8% and 4% in arms A and B, respectively. One case of grade-3 GU toxicity (0.4%) was observed in arm A. The incidence of grade-2 GI toxicity was below 2% in both arms. Concerning IPSS-based QoL rates, the rate of pts satisfied at baseline, W12 and 18-months were 80%, 78%, and 89% for arm A and 77%, 80% and 88% for arm B, respectively. No changes in EORTC QLQ-PR25 scores for GU, GI, and sexual domains were observed in both arms between baseline and W12, while an improvement was observed at 18 months for GU domains. Conclusion With a minimum follow-up of 18-months it is worth to underline the good tolerance and toxicity profile of both treatment arms in this study with minimal impact on GU QoL. Nonetheless, the potential influence of OTT and urethra-sparing on outcome and long-term tolerance requires a much longer follow-up to confirm these preliminary good results.",exclusion,Not the right comparator,,,,,,
random-journal.pdf,ProP323,,2017,English,pro.m:#5;pro.p:#5,What are the best ingredients to deliver the optimal radiotherapy for prostate cancer,"Optimisation for prostate radiotherapy involves understanding the natural history of prostate cancer, its prognosticators, the underlying radiobiology and strategies for radiotherapy treatment as well as how best to deliver the therapy regimes devised. Prostate cancer presents with a large spectrum of risk factors that drives its natural history as such the presenting prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, the summed Gleason score and the local tumour nodal and metastasis (TNM) staging. Taken together this combination of prognostic factors still provides the most reliable disease stratification compared to new tests or potential biomarkers that still require validation. It is well recognised that more reliable and sensitive predictive and prognostic factors are needed to distinguish risk groups within each risk stratification due to the large heterogeneity that exists within them. Using this approximately set of factors, prostate cancer can be divided into low, intermediate and high to very high risk groups for localised to regional disease that may receive radiotherapy curatively. This further guides the treatment volumes needed to achieve the best curative rate as well as the treatment strategies ie external beam photon therapy alone or in combination with high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy or HDR monotherapy or proton therapy In addition, over the past one to two decades, the understanding of prostate radiobiology has changed from accepting the standard alpha-beta ratio of 10 assigned for the majority of cancer diseases to a much lower alphabeta ratio much more akin to that of late reacting tissues. This lower alpha-beta ratio of around 1.2 to 2.5 has driven the radiotherapy rationale for using larger dose per fraction or hypofractionation. Earlier trials have suggested that this may provide a therapeutic benefit. Recently in the past year, 2 very large randomised trials have provided outcome equivalence for the use of moderate hypofractionation compared to conventional fractionation. The first randomised trial of over 800 cases from USA in early stage disease compared 2.75Gy to 1.8Gy dose fractions in a non-inferiority study can reported equivalence for the schedules. The second non-inferiority UK/International trial recruited nearly 3300 cases and reported equivalence of 3Gy to 2Gy dose fractions for early to intermediate stage prostate cancer. These outcomes have now established a new standard for the radiotherapeutic management of early to intermediate stage localised prostate cancer. These results should not be confused with the Dutch study looking for superiority of 3.3Gy over 2Gy dose fractions where the primary endpoint was not achieved. It remains to be determined if larger dose fractions (>= 5Gy) delivered over 1 week such as that used in stereotactic radiotherapy may provide further benefit. Trials are currently on going and their results are eagerly awaited. As important as the dose fractionation are the therapy regimes and the potentially combinations listed above. It is recognised that local failure often occurs at the site of dominant clonagenic numbers thus the utilisation of simultaneous integrated boosts with hypofractionation has potential. This is being assessed in several studies such as the FLAME study where toxicity was demonstrated to be similar to standard and conventional regimes. Important questions that need to be addressed include identification of appropriate treatment volumes and potential regions of dose escalation or even dose de-escalation. Just as important will be methods of ensure that these shorter treatment regimes are delivered both accurately and reliably. These aspects will be reviewed by the co-lecturers within this symposium.",exclusion,review,Llegir per referències sobre RCTs,PM250,,,,

Patients with this disease profile who could benefit from treatment with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) were selected and their responses to these techniques were rated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, controlled, unicentric study, involving 46 consecutive patients from our centre who presented biochemical relapse after adjuvant, salvage or radical treatment with external beam radiotherapy, or brachytherapy. After initial tests (bone scintigraphy, CT, pelvic MRI), 35 patients with oligometastases or without them were selected. 11 patients with multiple metastases were excluded from the study. WB-DW-MRI and choline-PET/CT was then performed on each patient within 1 week. The results were interpreted by specialists in nuclear medicine and MRI. If they were candidates for treatment with ablative SBRT (SABR), they were then evaluated every three months with both tests. RESULTS: Choline-PET/CT detected lesions in 16 patients that were not observable using WB-DW-MRI. The results were consistent in seven patients and in three cases, a lesion was observed using WB-DW-MRI that was not detected with choline-PET/CT. The Kappa value obtained was 0.133 (p = 0.089); the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of WB-DW-MRI were estimated at 44.93, 64.29, 86.11, and 19.15%, respectively. For choline-PET/CT patients, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 97.10, 58.33, 93.06, and 77.78%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Choline-PET/CT has a high global sensitivity while WB-DW-MRI has a high specificity, and so they are complementary techniques. Future studies with more enrolled patients and a longer follow-up period will be required to confirm these data. The initial data show that the best technique for evaluating response after SBRT is choline-PET/CT.
